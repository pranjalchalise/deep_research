Give Now Planned Giving Endowments Centre Fund Gifts to the Centre Fund provide vital flexibility, allowing the College to address student and institutional needs as they arise. Comprising about three-fourths of annual gifts, these contributions bridge the gap between the cost of tuition and the true expense of delivering the Centre Experience. Give to the Centre Fund Scholarships Ninety percent of Centre students receive financial aid, making the Centre Experience accessible to all. Unrestricted gifts and strong support for scholarships are essential to maintaining affordability and providing opportunities for students of all backgrounds. Give to Scholarships Experiential Learning A Centre education empowers students to be global change-makers. Courses take place inside and outside of the classroom, on and off campus—even abroad, and allow students to get credit for hands-on learning with options like internships, community-based learning, faculty-mentored research, and active participation in the arts. Donor support is essential to fulfilling this promise. Give to Experiential Learning Campus & Community Annual gifts that support community-building areas—such as diversity, environmental initiatives, the arts, and campus organizations—ensure Centre remains a welcoming home for all students. Give to the Centre Community Athletics Centre offers an exceptional education while promoting well-rounded student lives.

Thanks to alumni support, Centre's top-tier athletic and fitness facilities benefit students, faculty, and staff alike. Give to Athletics Not finding what you're looking for?

Give with a Planned Gift Centre College has long received generous financial support from alumni and friends. Most often these gifts are made outright to Centre, thereby providing the entire amount up front. Centre also receives what are known as deferred gifts, in which the donor has deferred Centre's receipt of the full value of the gift, or where the donor has reserved some benefit from the amount given. Deferred giving not only offers tremendous benefits to Centre, but can also help you enjoy tax and income advantages, particularly for gift plans that involve a transfer of assets during your lifetime, such as to a trust or life-income plan. Our Office of Gift Planning will work with you and your financial advisors to create a plan that works for you.
