Amanda currently serves as the Research Hydraulic Engineer and Deputy Program Manager for the Engineering With Nature Program at the US Army Corps of Engineers in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Learn more about Amanda and why professional licensure is important to her below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering? \" Growing up, I was always in love with math and had a passion for making a positive contribution to the world. To me, engineering is the application of math to develop infrastructure solutions to solve the world's problems. So it was my first and favorite choice for a career. \" Q2. How long have you been licensed in the State of Mississippi and do you also hold other state licenses? \" I have been licensed since the end of 2023 and hold no other licenses. I enjoyed my time studying for the exam and hope to get licensed in Florida and Georgia one day, as I often work with engineers in those states and thoroughly enjoy the work we do on the coastline. \" Q 3. What advice would you give to your younger self (HS grad, college grad, etc.)? \" Don't worry about \"figuring it out.\" You will always learn new information and make decisions as it comes to you. I moved from Environmental Engineering to Civil to Oceanographic Engineering, and I remember fearing that this pivoting would set me behind others who were staying true to their original course. Knowing what I do now, I wouldn't change a thing about that career path. My background is diverse, and I can approach infrastructure problems with a unique perspective. I am proud of my interdisciplinary knowledge, and I find myself invited to quite a dynamic setting that I thoroughly enjoy because of it. \" Q4. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \" Find someone in these fields with some experience under their belt, and talk to them. Often the STEM course-work is very different from the STEM work-work. Ask these individuals what they do every day and what the best parts of their careers have been. If their answers align with your life priorities and interests, then go for it! These careers might seem overwhelming at first, but you can always work at it. Everyone acts like they figured it out right away, and truly some people do, but a lot of us have to find our fit. Just like learning an instrument, you can slow the tempo down, take a beat, and practice at your own speed... and if that doesn't work, change up the key your in! Do not be discouraged if you don't 'get it' right away, you will figure it out. \" Q5. Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor? \" I am currently working on and collaborating with a diverse group of engineers and scientists on the Deer Island Restoration project in Mississippi. This initiative in meaningful to me due to its complexity, involving a variety of perspectives, stake-holder needs, and multiple discipline expertise. The project is in to response of destruction to the island and surrounding area during Hurricane Katrina. To me, this creates a unique opportunity to respond, adapt, and contribute positively by creating solutions that safeguard human life, military infrastructure, support ecosystems, and enhance environmental conditions. The project, while challenging, operates within the constraints of budget limitations and engineering challenges, and it is precisely these complexities that I find intriguing and the associated innovative opportunities compelling. I am also grateful to work with a highly respective, and very wise engineer on this project. Watching her navigate these challenges with ease and creativity, while bonding the many differing voices to create new engineering alternatives, more innovative than the last, has been a very rewarding experience. For these reasons and more, I think this project exemplifies my love for engineering. \" Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \" My interests will always lie in having a positive impact on the world. As a U.S. Corps of Engineers employee, I am a public servant, and I want to provide to the level that communities deserve. I want to be part of the delivery of innovative, multi-benefit infrastructure that, at its foundation, is sound in engineering integrity. The Professional Engineering license is important to me as it symbolizes my steadfast dedication to providing dependable engineering solutions. This licensure serves as a testament to my dedication to ongoing engineering education, a commitment to perpetual learning, and a pledge to uphold the utmost standards in the field of engineering. \" January 2024 Engineer Spotlight: Dr. John T.

We were also blown away by his two sayings and his commitment to the engineering profession. See what they are and l earn more about Kris and why professional licensure is important to him below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering? \" It probably goes back to when I was a young boy and liked and did well in Math and Science in school. I had a talent for thinking projects through very quickly, looking at all the options, and making a decision as to the right solution. From the time that I first set foot on the Mississippi State University campus, I knew this is where I wanted to go to school and that I wanted to an Engineer. I love Mississippi State University!!!! \" Q2. How long have you been licensed in the State of Mississippi and do you also hold other state licenses? \" I have been licensed in the State of Mississippi since 2004, working for the City of Gulfport, retired, and opened my own Engineering Firm in 2021. \" Q 3. What advice would you give to your younger self (HS grad, college grad, etc.)? \" Never give up on your dream, Always Remember your Hometown, Remember your Mentors, Volunteer to help the Community as much as you can, and Don’t waste the Talent that you have been given. I have 2 sayings that are self-explanatory. “If You Tolerate It, You Encourage It” and “Don’t Expect What You Don’t Inspect”. I started in Industrial Engineering because I thought of it to be management engineering, and I liked to communicate with people. My first job was in Industrial Engineering with a contractor of General Motors where we built car parts, but it was a long way from my hometown of Gulfport, Mississippi. I had a desire to come home. My second job was with the City of Gulfport where I worked my way up from Project Engineer to Director of Public Works to Director of Engineering and a sometimes had to wear both Director’s hats. I coached soccer for 16 years and have served on many committees at church. \" Q4. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \" Try to find mentors to listen to that have upstanding credibility. I had two mentors, Bill Powell, P.E. and Bill Mitchell, P.E., who I listened to what they said and then made my own decision. But their advice helped me to create a fantastic Public Works/Engineering Operation in Gulfport. Try to work in an engineering field before you graduate from college. I worked two (2) Summer Student positions one at Walt Disney World and the other at Johnson Controls World Services, Inc. where I gained very valuable experience to place on a resume. Any position that you apply for after graduation will be looking at your experience. I sit on the Engineering Advisory Committee for Harrison Central High School, my alma mater, and we are helping to shape today’s engineers and give this advice. Work in the Public Sector. Great Engineers often start their career working for the Public. It will give you a perspective of just how hard it is to make a public office successful and will make you see it from their side which will always provide a clearer path to the right decision. \" Q5. Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor? \" Hurricane Katrina (2005) preparedness, response, and recovery for the City of Gulfport. We started Gulfport’s Public Works in 1999 preparing the Department to be ready for a major hurricane. Six years later, we had one of the worst hurricanes on record, but our 200 staff members were ready for the challenge. I oversaw approximately 150 million dollars in water, sewer, drainage, debris removal, and paving recovery work. I coordinated creation and completion of projects using FEMA/MEMA funds by 2012 and stayed with the City until all the OIG audits were completed in 2020. We, as a team, earned me recognition as the Public Works Director of the Year for the United States of America in 2006. \" Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \" I believe that you should always try to do your best at whatever you are doing. I saw that in 1997 when I started in Gulfport that if you are going to have the best Gulfport office, you must have a license to get there. The license means that in every decision you make, you will hold the public welfare and safety as a premium, placing it before profits. As I continue with my new business, I still hold these values as stated in the Engineer’s Creed.\" Engineers' Creed As a Professional Engineer, I dedicate my professional knowledge to the advancement and betterment of public health, safety, and welfare. I pledge: To give the utmost of performance; To participate in none but honest enterprise; To live and work according to the highest standards of professional conduct; To place service before profit, the honor and standing of my profession before personal advantage, and the public welfare above all other considerations.

Janie currently works in the Hydraulics Branch - Bridge Division of the Mississippi Department of Transportation and is a Certified Floodplain Manager . We love featuring persons who show the wealth of opportunity afforded at Mississippi's community colleges not to mention the diversity of the persons who choose that option. Janie also stood out as her path to engineering began as a child and was supported by a high school that offered classes with an emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). We think this is a key factor in getting more youth into STEM but certainly into #engineering and #surveying and will be central to moving the needle toward more engineering and surveying professionals in the future. Learn more about Janie and why professional licensure is important to her below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering? \" As a kid, I was always very hands-on and interested in how things work. In high school, we had STEM classes that gave me the opportunity to write code, program robots, learn about electronics, how computers work and so on. Between that and the guidance from teachers who suggested engineering, I’m grateful I was exposed to STEM. Even though I was exposed to it, I still wasn’t sure if I wanted to pursue engineering as a career path. It wasn’t until after my first semester at college that I really decided engineering was the path I wanted to take. \" Q2. How long have you been licensed in the State of Mississippi and do you also hold other state licenses? \" I have been licensed in the State of Mississippi since 2019. I am also a Certified Floodplain Manager. \" Q 3. What advice would you give to your younger self (HS grad, college grad, etc.)? \" I would tell my high school self that it is worth it to try hard things.

The Mississippi Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors would like to shine a spotlight on Professional Engineer William \"Willie\" McKercher. Mr. McKercher is the Chief of the Dam Safety Division of the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Biological Engineering from the Bagley College of Engineering at Mississippi State University and earned a Master of Science Degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Mississippi through the Jackson Engineering Graduate Program while working at the MDEQ. We were really impressed with Willie's responses and felt his excitement and enthusiasm for the work he does in dam safety and in keeping Mississippians safe. We love people who love what they do. Learn more about Willie and why professional licensure is important to him below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering? \" It may sound corny, but I feel more like engineering chose me. From an early age I wanted to understand how things worked. My dad had me working and building alongside him with every project he had at home, and over time that desire to learn and understand how things worked just continued to grow and grow. He was a great teacher. In junior high, I joined the Technology Student Association under my shop teacher, Sgt. Arthur Miller, and found a group of friends that shared my interests. That group of friends pushed each other to do better and better every year, competing in local and statewide contests all the way through high school. I was hooked. That group produced 6 engineers that have all excelled in their chosen engineering specialties. Through Boy Scouts, I also had the chance to work on several projects with engineers in the Vicksburg area as I worked towards becoming an Eagle Scout. I was lucky enough to always be surrounded by the right people and opportunities to reinforce key engineering principles. \" Q2. . How long have you been licensed in the State of Mississippi and do you also hold other state licenses? \" I became licensed in Mississippi in January of 2007 and also hold licensure in Arkansas. \" Q 3. What advice would you give to your younger self (HS grad, college grad, etc.)? \" I was lucky enough to have people tell me this along the way, many times over, but I didn’t understand it well at the time – don’t be afraid to fail. We all do it every day, but we dust ourselves off, and try to take another shot. It’s why they call it trial and error. I was a member of Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity and there motto was Ecclesiastes 9:10 “Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.” In short, I’d tell myself to get after it kid, cause there’s no better time than now to take advantage of this amazing world you have around you. \" Q4. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \" First, I have to say that working with young people and getting to talk to them about engineering is about as awesome as it gets. All engineers have a special place in our hearts for helping spark a fire in the life of someone developing “the knack”. My message for young people who may be interested in STEM careers is that this path is not just a road to knowledge, but learning what to do with it once you have it. Engineers take the lessons learned and knowledge acquired and use those concepts to solve new complex problems. And the fun part is that as the world changes, everyday we wake up to a new set of challenges and opportunities to make life better for those around us. STEM doesn’t just teach you how to put a round peg in the round hole, it provides you with an opportunity to be a key part of the world around you. It gives you a place and it will help give you purpose. \" Q5. Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor? \" I’m currently working as the Division Chief of the Dam Safety Program in the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. Our program oversees more than 7000+ dams in the state of Mississippi, but most of our attention rests on ~350 dams considered high hazard dams. They draw our focus because in the event those dams were to fail, there is potential for loss of life or significant damage to infrastructure downstream. Any time we can upgrade those dams, we make people safer. A recent move helped us accelerate the goal of making those high hazard dams safer. During the 2020 Mississippi session, the state Legislature passed an act creating the Mississippi Dam Safety Fund with the goal of helping dam owners pay for the expensive repairs required for high hazard dams. Once created, myself and my division have been tasked with implementing the program to select and support the owners through the process of getting the repairs and modifications completed. To date, we’ve been able to bring dams into compliance that were struggling with the potential cost of repairs. That means that hundreds of families that live below those structures are able to sleep more safely at night. That gives this job meaning, and that’s what makes me proud to do what I do. \" Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \" The public knows and understands what the weight of those two initials beside your name mean. It carries the weight of great expectations. It demonstrates that the individual has the competency to do the job and has made the ethical commitment to ensure protection of the public. Personally, I also see professional licensure as a guarantee and commitment that protects the reputation of the engineering profession. I know that person I’m speaking with has put in the time and effort to learn their craft, and I can put faith in their judgements. That means a lot these days. \" August 2023 Engineer Spotlight: Trent Holbrook, P.E.

You can tell from his responses that he takes pride in his work and that he appreciates being a Professional Engineer. We also like his advice to young people. Failure is oft times the best teacher. Learn more about Trent and why professional licensure is important to him below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering? \" I have always been fascinated with roads and bridges. Every summer growing up, my family took road trips to visit family in other states. My favorite part of the trip was getting to drive over the Mississippi River Bridge in Baton Rouge. I always thought how cool it would be to get to work on something like that one day. . \" Q2. . How long have you been licensed in the State of Mississippi and do you also hold other state licenses? \" I have been licensed in the State of Mississippi since January 2017. \" Q 3. What advice would you give to your younger self (HS grad, college grad, etc.)? \" Do not be discouraged when you make mistakes. No one is perfect. Learn from those mistakes and become a better person because of it. \" Q4. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \" STEM careers are challenging and rewarding. I drive past and on projects I was a part of building every day. It is great to see something you were a part of being used by so many people. \" Q5. Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor? \" I was the MDOT Engineer over the recently constructed I-20 Eastbound bridge over US-51, I-55 South, and Canadian National / Illinois Central Railroad in Hinds County. This was a great project to work on and presented many challenges. The project consisted of building a larger, adjacent structure and demolishing the existing bridge. It also included new construction and widening along I-20 Eastbound and I-55 Northbound for the new bridge and roadway alignment and ramps. All of this was accomplished while keeping the existing road open to traffic. \" Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \" I believe having a professional license holds us to a higher standard. The traveling public relies on us to ensure roads and bridges are safely built and maintained. \" July 2023 Engineer Spotlight: Trey Hess, P.E.

How long have you been licensed in the State of Mississippi and do you also hold other state licenses? \" I received my license in Mississippi in 1995 while at the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). As my role as Brownfield Director for PPM Consultants, Inc. has grown since accepting the position in 2016 when I retired from MDEQ, I have found the need for licensing in other states and intend to apply for licensure in Louisiana, Florida, and Alabama in 2023. \" Q 3. What advice would you give to your younger self (HS grad, college grad, etc.)? \" Make learning a lifelong habit. Just like exercise, you're never too old to exercise and you're never too old to learn. Always remember to use grace when dealing with others. You don't know their life story. Finally, you don't know it all. \" Q4. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \" While your passion may be the math and science fields and working with numbers is clear and concise, remember that we live in a word of human interaction and all the messiness that it entails. With that being said, Stephen Covey put it best, \"seek first to understand, then to be understood. \" Q5. Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor? \" The transformation of the former Team Motors Auto shop and an abandoned gas station in Louisville into Jack's Family Restaurant's 100 th grand opening last year was pretty special to me. This project started with PPM successfully managing the City of Louisville (MS) Brownfield Assessment Grant from 2017-2020 where PPM completed a total of 11 Phase I, six Phase II, three Phase III ESAs, 1 asbestos inspection, and one Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The most complex property assessed in Louisville was the former Team Motors facility where asbestos, soil, groundwater, and soil vapor were encountered. This brownfield project incorporates assessment funding from the EPA Brownfield Assessment Grant, a community involvement process through the EPA grant and MDEQ’s Brownfields Program, and the willingness of a private sector company to tackle asbestos, vapor intrusion, and a groundwater cleanup. The transformation of the former Team Motors automotive repair facility and gas station into a new Jack’s Family Restaurant (Jack’s) is a perfect example of what public-private collaboration can achieve in communities with less than 10,000 residents. The redevelopment and cleanup of the Team Motors brownfield represent a $2.25M private-sector investment into our community, bringing with it as many as 45 jobs, and a commitment from the developer to take on the roughly $600,000 cleanup of the site. Our goal was to encourage cleanup, redevelopment, and job creation in the Louisville community. That goal has been achieved. \" Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \" Our first duty as Engineers is to health and safety of the public. It's not profit margin, shareholder wealth, or even personal satisfaction. Sure, all of these are important and are a part of our daily duties, but like physicians whose duty is to do no harm; we, as engineers, have an enormous responsibility that we should embrace and be proud of. \" June 2023 Engineer Spotlight: Rachel Weinberg, P.E.

Donald (or Don as he prefers to be called) is a graduate of \"Thee I Love\" Jackson State University with both a Bachelor and Master of Science degree in civil engineering. We chose Don because of his story to licensure. He pursued his degree as you we see from our conversation below, later in life after marriage and children. While not the typical (or easiest) route to the engineering profession, his story provides us with dual inspiration that sometimes, #PEPTalks are internal and occur in our adult lives when we decide to try something new but also highlights how #PEPTalks could have benefitted a young Donald when he was in high school. Learn more about Don and why professional licensure is important to him below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering? \" I chose engineering because I like to problem solve. At the time, I didn’t realize that the problems I would be solving would have such wide spread ramifications and affect so many people. Now I see engineers as the unsung heroes of civilization. So many aspects of everyday life would not be possible without engineers. Clean water, thank an engineer. Bridge over a river, thank an engineer. A person can walk even though they don’t have legs, thank an engineer. I could keep going, but you get the idea. \" Q2. How long have you been licensed in the State of Mississippi, and do you also hold other state licenses? \" I was awarded my MS EI license in 2013 and my PE in 2018. I also hold a PE license in AL and LA. I am also a Certified Floodplain Manager. \" Q3. What advice would you give to your younger self (HS grad, college grad, etc.)? \" Well, I am an individual who went back to school after I was married and had children, so if I could go back to me just after HS, I would tell myself that you can and should try to attain your engineering degree right away. It is a lot easier than working toward it as a husband and father. \" Q4. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \" I would say to definitely follow that interest. Find someone who is already in the field you are interested in and ask them to explain what they do day in and day out. Make sure that is what you really want to do before beginning the journey it takes to get there. It isn’t the easiest journey, but in my opinion, results in one of the best destinations! \" Q5. Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor? \" I was working on a lock/gate replacement in Florida. I have never had a project like this, and I loved it because it was very difficult and challenging. Not only did I have to solve the problem at hand, but I had to figure out how to solve the problem. Its projects like this that keep me excited about engineering. \" Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \" Licensure is important to me because it is the best way I know of to ensure engineers continue to stay at the cutting edge of their profession by requiring continuing education, which includes ethics training, throughout our career.

Ms. Young holds both a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Louisiana State University and Auburn University, respectively. She currently serves as a Engineer Manager at Neel-Schaffer, Incorporated in their Baton Rouge, LA office and was most recently promoted to Vice President, Engineering Manager with the company. Like many of us, Dishili was drawn to engineering by a love for math and science and a realization of the impact engineering has on a community. We were also drawn to the fact that the bridge competition in an AP Physics class was the catalyst for her decision to major in civil engineering. We like hearing of these #PEPTalks kind of experiences. Learn more about Dishili and why professional licensure is important to her below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering? \"I have always enjoyed math and science. However, it was later in life when I realized how engineering has such a positive impact on the community and that is my reason for choosing a career in engineering.

I have spent a lot of time playing it safe and wanting to wait until the “right time” to step into something new or complete something more challenging. However, some of my largest successes in life were completed under the most difficult conditions and less than idea timing. I completed my first complex design project while caring for a mother-in-law with alzheimer's. I completed my graduate school studies just a couple of months after my late husband passed away. I obtained my first professional leadership position amid a company acquisition which took place right after I was hired. While I would have never chosen to experience any of these situations, and each challenged me to the very core of my spirit, I realize that they have given me strength and increased my faith to a degree which I believe would not have happened under ideal conditions. It has also allowed me to obtain experience which has helped to propel my career to a higher level.\" Q4. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \"Go for it! These careers are in high demand and offer security at a level which transcends time. There are so many disciplines to choose from you are bound to find one that you enjoy.

Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor? \"I am currently working with a team of engineers to complete the design services for the future I-49 corridor. This project will reconstruct an existing roadway corridor to provide a new mainline freeway and interchange in Louisiana. There are several things I enjoyed about the project. One has been working with some of the sharpest engineers (both inside and outside our company) to provide roadway geometry and a drainage design which will fit a total of 12 travel lanes within a right of way width that was originally intended for only 6 lanes. When you add the auxiliary lanes, shoulders and four drainage swales to the corridor section, it makes for a very constrained project, which required complex design solutions. The other thing I have enjoyed about the project is a safety study completed with a coworker which considered the safety benefits of providing a median barrier verse providing a shared clear zone between two roadways within the corridor. The analysis was performed utilizing the FHWA IHSDM Software to show the predicted number of crashes would decrease if outside barrier were replaced with a shared clear zone between the frontage roadway and mainline, saving the DOT $4.5M in barrier cost. In addition, it reduced required right-of-way, and increased safety. The analyses performed utilized the Interactive Highway Safety Design Model (IHSDM) software (v13.1.0), which relies on the Highway Safety Manual (HSM), to estimate the proposed I-49 segment’s predicted safety performance.\" Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \"It is important because it provides a certain level of assurance to our clients regarding our knowledge because of the vetting process.

The Mississippi Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors would like to shine a spotlight on Professional Engineer Sarah McEwen. Sarah is a graduate of Mississippi State University where she received a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering. She is an active member of the Mississippi Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers and is the President of the Friends of the Mississippi River Basin Model. She also works as the Water Resources Manager at AECOM. Her list of accomplishments and accolades are many. We chose Sarah however, for two reasons: (1) her passion and recognition of water resources specifically the Mississippi River (i.e. recent news about dredging, water level and its economic impact) and (2) her outreach to youth to encourage them to pursue engineering. She's been giving #PEPTalks for a while and like us, she recognizes the importance of sharing our engineering experience with young people as a way to introduce and draw them to the profession. Like others that we've featured, it was the exposure to a program or person in engineering that drew her to the profession. Thank you Sarah for your outreach efforts. Please continue them. Learn more about Sarah and why professional licensure is important to her in the responses below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering or who inspired you to pursue a career in engineering? \" Growing up the child of two engineers with several cousins and uncles also in engineering, I was very resistant to go into the field. I thought I should try any other field to be different. However, during high school I attended the engineering summer camp held at MSU and participated in our schools work study program. Both were opportunities to work directly in research at universities. Ultimately, having been exposed to engineering at such a young age and just supported to go into a STEM field, I realized I had the skills and habits of an engineer engrained in me. I think I felt more empowered to be an engineer as a female because I saw my mom work in the field of Computer Software Engineering and my older sister pursue Biological Engineering. I was still able to be a little different in choosing Civil Engineering but it was the engineering major to which I felt the most connected. \" Q2. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \" Outreach, especially for pre-college students K-12 has always been a passion of mine because I know how important exposure is to supporting kids to join engineering. I know had my parents not unintentionally instilled engineering skills in me, I may not have chosen engineering. I think anyone wanting to pursue STEM careers should know the jobs in STEM don’t always look the way you may have stereotyped. I would encourage them to pursue some of the resources that local and national organizations provide. For instance, Women’s Transportation Seminar (WTS) has resources for STEM activities K-12 and provides a scholarship/mentorship program every year that sends virtually or in person a high school student to learn more about transportation to DC. The American Society of Civil Engineers has resources for starting a Civil Engineering high school club, STEM activities K-12, and can connect you to having an engineer virtually/in person come talk to your class. The Mississippi Engineering Society supports local outreach as well and helps support MATHCOUNTS. I would encourage parents and young people to reach out and email any organization in the field of study you might be interested in, chances are they are more than happy to talk to you about what a day in the life looks like for that field. \" Q3. What state(s) are you licensed in and what certifications do you have. \" I have been licensed since 2018 in the State of Mississippi, and I am also registered in Louisiana and Texas. I am also a Certified Floodplain Manager and Bridge Inspector. \" Q4. What is your favorite quote? As a member of Zeta Tau Alpha, there is a portion of our creed that I have painted on a canvas in my office, “to prepare for service and learn the nobility of serving, thereby earning the right to be served; to seek understanding that we might gain true wisdom; to look for the good in everyone; to see beauty, with its enriching influence\". I think this has always spoken to me and speaks to the Engineering Code of Ethics and how in our profession we are called to serve the public first above ourselves. Q5. Tell us about a project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / or surveyor. I like when projects from various clients build upon one another as far as technical applications go. We recently had a large project evaluating with hydraulic numerical models the fluvial and coastal scour mechanisms on several bridges in Mississippi. This application, along with insight from getting my bridge inspector certification, and working alongside guidance development to evaluate compound flooding scenarios in Louisiana really encompasses where we are as a profession in evaluating risk and where we have to go in the future. It can be a complex interaction of known processes, guidance, and policies. In the future how we advocate for policy changes, and evaluate risk under complex scenarios will be a big discussion point. I think this keeps our profession at the forefront of technology as well as emphasizes the need for continuing education in the profession. Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \" I believe licensure is important for several reasons. It establishes a standard of care, ensures a method of enforcing compliance, and most importantly supports continuing education in our ever changing field. I think we all need to have a questioning attitude and curiosity about how best to analyze and produce products for clients. Continuing education and ethics ensures we keep up to date in our field and make informed decisions/judgements on analysis methods. \" October 2022 Engineer Spotlight: Jason Gibson, P.E.

Learn more about Jason and why professional licensure is important to him in his responses below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering or who inspired you to pursue a career in engineering? \" I have a natural tendency to be a problem solver. I enjoy tackling a project or issues most people shy away from. It motivates me to learn as much as I can about my profession and to store as many tools in my toolbox to make me the best engineer possible. I love design work. I love to be creative, and I love to build things. Honestly, I had not planned to attend college. Two girls approached me my senior year in high school about becoming a cheerleader at Jones County Junior College (JCJC). I liked the idea of hanging out with girls. I gave it a shot and ended up making the team. As a result, it paid for several years of my college. Jessie Smith, currently the president of JCJC, influenced my decision to become an engineer. I remember Jessie telling me that math was the language of engineers. That caught my attention, and I knew I was terrible at writing. That was a pivotal moment in my life. It was several years later and several disciplines later that I discovered my love for civil. \" Q2. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? \" It takes discipline and hard work to become an engineer or surveyor. Most people will lack the mental fortitude and toughness required to get through the rigors of engineering school. They lack the discipline to defer pleasure to later in life. You spend many of nights studying while your suitemates are out partying. It’s a sacrifice. The sacrifice is worth it. The degree and education you receive in engineering school is an investment and will pay dividends over the course of your life. For me personally, I like being able to solve problems that a very low percentage of people on earth can do. I take pride in that. \" Q3. What state(s) are you licensed in and what certifications do you have. \" I am licensed in MS & AL. I have my 30hr OSHA and wastewater II certifications. I also have my heavy civil and residential contractor’s license. \" Q4. What is your favorite quote? I have two favorite quotes. Dave Ramsey says to \"live like no one else today, so you can live like no one else tomorrow\". That’s simple but profound. Few people will experience this as a result of being financially disciplined. \"Hard times create strong men. Strong men create easy times. Easy times create weak men. Weak men create hard times.\" Q5. Tell us about a project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / or surveyor. I’m currently working on a trash issue created by the local jail. One would be amazed at what a prisoner can fit and flush down the toilet. This issue, according to the Harrison County Development Commissions (HCDC) records, has been ongoing since 1988. In 2021, I designed and installed a trash interceptor in the jail’s sewer system. The project is currently 50% complete. I procured a free decommissioned bar screen from the local utility authority that will be rehabilitated in house and retrofitted for this application. Upon completion, the project will remove the debris from the collection system and deposit the debris directly into a dumpster. The cost to rehabilitate the downstream pump station servicing the jail was $250k in 2020. The station was retrofitted to a submersible “chopper” pump setup. While these pumps prevent many of the issues the Commission suffered from the typical centrifugal pump, it did create another issue. The chopper pumps would shred a thousand pieces of debris into a million pieces before it pumped it to the treatment plant. The debris continually created issues with the plant’s treatment process and was a costly everyday maintenance issue. Since the installation of the interceptor, 98% of the trash is continually being removed from the collection system. This is a big improvement regarding the life of the pumps, and more importantly the quality of discharged effluent into the Biloxi Bay. The same bay I live on and swim in every year. I’ve enjoyed being a part of the solution to a problem that has existed roughly 34 years with no end in sight. That encapsulates why I enjoy doing what I do. Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? \" It allows me to be creative and gives me the knowledge and authority to do so . I am the expert. \" July 2022 Engineer Spotlight: Eric Jefferson, P.E., AICP, PTP The Mississippi Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors would like to shine a spotlight on Professional Engineer Eric Jefferson, P.E., AICP, PTP.

In 2020 he completed the Environmental Engineering Master's program at Jackson State University and was recently accepted into their PhD program. Thank you for being open and honest in your responses Eric. We are certain your words will help others. We look forward to calling you Dr. James in the very near future, Learn more about Eric in his responses below: Q1. Why did you choose engineering or surveying? I am a little ashamed to say I stumbled blindly into it. Coming out of my enlistment in the Navy, I knew I wanted to go to college but didn't know what I wanted to do. I enjoyed and was not bad at math so I looked into engineering. But I still didn't know what flavor of engineer I wanted to be. I started out as Mechanical and switched to Biological. Even after I graduated with a Biological Engineering degree, I still didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up. It was only after I started work as Environmental Engineer-in-Training for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality I realized I enjoyed the challenge that comes along with environmental work. Q2. How long have you been licensed in the State of Mississippi and do you also hold other state licenses? I have been licensed in the State of Mississippi since 2017. Q3. What advice would you give to your younger self (HS grad, college grad, etc)? Because my road was winding and haphazard this is near and dear to my heart. Go talk to people. Go talk to engineers, surveyors, etc, etc. We love talking about what we do. Most of us will do what we can to get you on ride-alongs and show you as much of the profession as possible. Whatever you do, get as close to firsthand knowledge of the profession(s) you are considering as possible. Even if you like (or dislike) the courses you are taking in the curriculum, those may have little to nothing to do with the reality of the job. Q4. What would you say to young people, who might be interested in STEM careers such as engineering or surveying? 1) It is hard; you will want to quit and settle for something easier. Don't. 2) Find a mentor or support group to talk to when you get discouraged. This doesn't make you weak to ask for help, it makes you wise. 3) Intern, co-op, volunteer, and research (as said above) Q5. Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor? I am a project manager for MDEQ's Groundwater Assessment and Remediation Division. At a current site, there are multiple contaminants that are similar in nature, but require slightly different approaches when trying to remediate. For just this one project, I have had to research the individual contaminates and remediation efforts used and emerging, collaborate with the consultant and property owner to achieve a balance between clean-up aggressiveness and economy, and muck through a literal swamp in order to observe and aid in sampling events. The sheer variety of tasks and duties within a single project, much less from project to project, is energizing. There is always another problem to overcome and puzzle to solve. Q6. Why is professional licensure important to you? 1) It sets a known standard. If someone says they are a PE, I immediately know they graduated with an engineering degree, have at least 4 years of experience, and passed two profession-specific tests (EIT and PE). It lets me know how much I should expect from them. 2) It protects our profession from dilution. Instead of anyone being able to claim the title of engineer, there is a very strict and arduous process to be able to be counted and remain amongst our numbers. These credentials can be verified, and those practicing without a license can be punished. The standards and checks lend significance and credibility to the profession to the general public's eyes, as with lawyers and physicians. January 2022 Engineer Spotlight: Ryan Steiner, P.E. The Mississippi Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors would like to shine a spotlight on Professional Engineer Ryan Steiner.
