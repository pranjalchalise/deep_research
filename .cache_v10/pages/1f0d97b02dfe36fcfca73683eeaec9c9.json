  "data": "We Are IT – Hao Dong The Office of Information Technology at The University of Alabama is home to an impressive range of IT professionals who strive to provide effective technological support across campus. Today, we highlight the work of Hao Dong, a Technology Specialist concentrating on Machine Learning (ML) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Hao Dong recently joined The University of Alabama in February 2024 and has since served a crucial role in promoting ML and GIS technologies through OIT. His path to the IT field began with an interest in mathematics, a foundation that sparked a curiosity toward programming. While in graduate school, he studied engineering and planning, through which he discovered a passion for automating processes via coding. “When I had the opportunity to do some programming to either speed up the process or automate some process, I enjoyed doing it,” he explained. This interest shifted into expertise, leading Dong to his career in IT, where he now generates machine learning models and manages GIS systems. The daily demands of this role require Dong to manage the GIS system for The University, including ArcGIS Online (a cloud-based solution) and an enterprise GIS system hosted by OIT for improved safety and functionality. “Basically, I’m managing the GIS system for the whole university,” he said. “We have more control over it here, and it’s behind the firewall, so it’s more secure.” Through this work, Dong contributes towards integrating the GIS tools across campus to support university needs. Regarding machine learning, Dong collaborates with faculty on research projects to produce models and supply consulting services. From advising faculty on the most effective ML tools to use or co-developing solutions, his efforts serve to merge data science and practical applications in the academic environment. “Some of the projects come from professors, so we work together with them to develop different models,” he said. “Sometimes it’s just providing consulting services. For example, they are unsure which model to use or how to build a model, so we have discussions with them and sometimes even code together.” When asked to share his favorite aspect of his work, Dong credited AI and machine learning. He finds the IT field exciting due to its constant and rapid progress, particularly areas such as foundation models, referring to large-scale AI systems comprising extensive quantities of information to foster more intuitive human-computer exchanges. “It brings new ideas to search, to education. We just teach a model a lot of things, all kinds of knowledge, and then we can use human language to interact with it,” he explained. On the other hand, staying current on the latest innovations can pose a considerable challenge. “It’s a lot to keep track of,” Dong admitted. “Every day, we have some new ideas. Big companies are releasing new models constantly. It’s like a daily race.” Despite this obstacle, Dong stays optimistic and enthusiastic in his pursuit of innovative applications of AI in IT and education. Dong stresses the critical function OIT serves in supporting the campus, from faculty and staff to students. “OIT is supporting the whole university, and that’s quite amazing,” he said. “We have different parts to support different functions across the university.” When asked what the future of IT looked like on campus, he expressed a desire for the continued enhancement of education through new tools and research collaboration. “The priority is definitely to keep supporting the UA community,” he said. “At the same time, keeping pace with new technology is also important.” Outside of his work in IT, Dong enjoys outdoor hobbies, including hiking and skiing. “For the past four or five years, we went to Colorado to ski every year,” he shared. A self-proclaimed foodie, he loves exploring local restaurants. “From time to time, I search for a good local restaurant, and even when we travel, we try to hunt for a local restaurant to get the local taste.” A few of his favorite spots in the Tuscaloosa area include River, Hooligans, and Jim ‘N Nick’s for barbecue. Dong is also a fan of the Ohio State Buckeyes and follows their athletics program year-round. Hao Dong’s work at OIT emphasizes the importance of technology, research, and education, with his expertise in ML and GIS functioning as a crucial aspect in the advancement of IT services at UA. As the world of artificial intelligence continuously evolves, experts such as Dong guarantee that the university remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
