The range of R. C.’s vast interest and contribution, along with the irresistible charm of his personality, require a biographer who is a church historian, theologian, and very close friend. Stephen Nichols is the best choice, as this account demonstrates. He has brought to the pages a story truly revealing R. C.―an account that lives and breathes the man we loved as our teacher and friend. There will be other biographies of R.C., but I cannot imagine any that would come close to this one.” ― John MacArthur, Late Pastor, Grace Community Church, Sun Valley, California “This book is worth your time because it celebrates a man worth remembering. R. C. was a masterful theologian who could so easily squeeze sweetness from what others considered dry doctrine. His sermons and books beautifully adorned the gospel, but so did his life. It’s what I love about Stephen Nichols’s remarkable work. He takes us behind the scenes to reveal the true makings of this great saint of the twentieth century, why his words endure, and why we are inexorably drawn to his live-large character. I’ve always admired R. C. Sproul for his razor-sharp mind; now, with this biography, he’s printed on my heart. Thank you, Stephen Nichols, for helping the reader fall in love with this lion of a man, my friend, the good Doctor Sproul.” ― Joni Eareckson Tada, Founder and CEO, Joni and Friends International Disability Center “I couldn’t put this book down, for it doesn’t just tell the fascinating story of a life well lived; it takes you on R. C.’s own journey. Through it you see where the fire came from. Through it you get the thrill of soaking up his passion for the gospel of Christ, for biblical truth, and for the beauty of God in his holiness. But my hope for this book is not that it might provide a nice reunion for those of us who knew and loved R. C.; my prayer is that the Lord might use it to inspire more faithful Reformers, more God-fearing defenders and proclaimers of the faith, more like R. C. Sproul.” ― Michael Reeves, President and Professor of Theology, Union School of Theology, United Kingdom “I remember once hearing R. C. Sproul preach on Psalm 51, and I asked him afterward how long it had taken him to prepare his lecture that day. He smiled and said, ‘About five minutes . . . and thirty years.’ I have no doubt that future generations will benefit from R. C.’s prolific ministry two hundred years from now, should the Lord tarry. Stephen Nichols has given us a gift in this book. Anyone whose life was marked, as mine has been, by R. C.’s life and ministry will treasure getting to know him better through these pages.” ― Bob Lepine, Cohost, FamilyLife Today ; Teaching Pastor, Redeemer Community Church, Little Rock, Arkansas “Stephen Nichols has written a fantastic biography about one of the greatest minds and finest teachers of our time. This book highlights the theology, biblical integrity, courage, character, and intellectual prowess of one the late giants of the modern-day church―a man who fought the good fight and had the honor of finishing well the race set before him by his Lord, whom he loved, revered, and worshiped all his life. R. C. immediately recognized when the gospel was at stake, and he applied his keen mind in defense of it, sometimes at great cost. It was a privilege and a delight to read about R. C. Sproul, one of the three men who have most influenced my thinking concerning the character of God in general and his piercing holiness in particular. I am indebted to him in so many ways.” ― Miguel Núñez, Pastor-Teacher, Iglesia Bautista Internacional, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic “Even though R. C. Sproul’s name will stand in the annals of church history as one of its great theologians in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, few people know about his life, career, struggles, victories, and ministries. This book will give you the historical and spiritual context around R. C.’s greatest series, books, and sermons. You will be able to understand the power of God’s grace in R. C.’s life, R. C.’s dominion of all areas in systematic theology, and his ability to understand and teach biblical text in a simple and clear way. Knowing the man helps you better understand the preacher. Stephen Nichols has helped me get to know better the man that God has used to bless my ministry.” ― Augustus Nicodemus Lopes, Pastor, Esperança Bible Presbyterian Church, Orlando, Florida; former Chancellor, Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie, Brazil “This book is about a man from a small town outside Pittsburgh who was chosen by God to teach, preach, and communicate the gospel to millions of people around the world. The Lord used this disciple of Jesus Christ in a mighty way. His ability to convey the word of God in simple yet powerful ways and his love and kindness toward his fellow man were evident throughout his life. His teaching ministry, books, and lessons have taught so many the truth and holiness of God. We miss him, but he fought the good fight, he finished the race, and he kept the faith as a servant to our holy God.” ― Robert M. Wohleber, Retired CFO, Kerr-McGee “Stephen Nichols, an extraordinary scholar and exhaustive researcher, does an outstanding job portraying a man of intelligence, communicative ability, and love who devoted his life to Jesus Christ by teaching and preaching the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture, the holiness of God, and the solas . R. C. was devoted to keeping the gospel pure, logical, and understandable for the laymen. The Holy Spirit, using R. C.’s time, patience, wit, and logic, without ever compromising biblical doctrine, led this ‘heathen’ lawyer and countless others to Jesus Christ. As Nichols so clearly illustrates in this biography of the life of a titan of the Christian faith, R. C.’s ministry will continue to ‘count forever’ for many as they live coram Deo .” ― Guy T. Rizzo, attorney “Stephen Nichols is thorough, well-balanced, and theologically alert in this biography of R. C. Sproul. He writes the way R. C. lived and taught. Readers of R. C. and Reformation lovers will appreciate this story of the leader of Reformed revival for a new generation.” ― Russ Pulliam, Columnist, Indianapolis Star “R. C. Sproul was such a vibrant and interesting person that it would be a mortal sin to write a dull biography about him. On this point Stephen Nichols is sinless, giving us a captivating and deeply insightful portrait of an extraordinary Christian. He shows us R. C. as he was: passionate for God’s truth and God’s people yet balanced and centered; learned yet clear and popular; successful yet humble and always himself. Nichols’s only fault―if it is a fault―is that he left me wanting more.” ― W.

Nichols (PhD, Westminster Theological Seminary) serves as the president of Reformation Bible College and chief academic officer of Ligonier Ministries.

It was done very well from intricate details of childhood and relation to towns that was fascinating to show the early years that would form this awesome man of God. The college years that further gave convictions that carried through his life's decisions in so many ways. Love the way Nichols broke down segments of theology that were so important and an overview of where RC stood. A priceless book that glorifies God and How God truly used the full life of this extraordinary man to change the world. This book is good for the pastor, theologian, and basic Christian disciple. It could even bring the learner to become the disciple God has in plan for them to be. The appendix 1 was a great addition of his last sermon in written form. Truly magnificent. R.C. Sproul was a hero to his kids, loving husband, inspiration to students, shepherd to the flock, defender of the gospel, fighter for inerrantcy of God's Word, and all about our Holy, Holy, Holy God almighty to the core and fiber of his being.

TWorts 5.0 out of 5 stars Greatest Theologian of our time Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021 Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase As one who has taken many courses through Ligonier Ministries and read many of his books, this was a natural to pick this book up. It was done very well from intricate details of childhood and relation to towns that was fascinating to show the early years that would form this awesome man of God. The college years that further gave convictions that carried through his life's decisions in so many ways. Love the way Nichols broke down segments of theology that were so important and an overview of where RC stood. A priceless book that glorifies God and How God truly used the full life of this extraordinary man to change the world. This book is good for the pastor, theologian, and basic Christian disciple. It could even bring the learner to become the disciple God has in plan for them to be. The appendix 1 was a great addition of his last sermon in written form. Truly magnificent. R.C. Sproul was a hero to his kids, loving husband, inspiration to students, shepherd to the flock, defender of the gospel, fighter for inerrantcy of God's Word, and all about our Holy, Holy, Holy God almighty to the core and fiber of his being. Such an example to follow and hear about his heroes in the faith. A priceless gem and the legacy he left remains in good hands for now.

I met his wife, Vesta, in 1961. His life story is to be appreciated by all who know Christ as their Lord and Savior Read more Helpful Report M. Howard Kehr 5.0 out of 5 stars The Holiness of GOD! Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021 Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase If you know anything at all about Robert C. Sproul, or if you wished to know ONE THING about Robert C. Sproul, was has passion to communicate to all humanity the Holiness of GOD! What it means, how it affects us (whether we acknowledge it or not) and its placement in the narrative of Jesus the Christ (his person and work.) The most popular narrative of GOD, or what people might say is His 'greatest' attribute is His \"Love\". Quoting John 3: 16 endlessly (and out of context), these people believe that GOD loves them 'unconditionally'. Or even loves us \"all\" 'unconditionally'. If GOD does, then why was Jesus crucified (killed in a horrific way)? There follows a number of contradictive arguments by these proponents that are, at best, confused. Dr. Sproul, with his passion, wished to show that GOD's holiness has and is as an important attribute as is His justice, love, perfection, etc. It is the very backdrop where we can see that the sacrifice of the Christ was so very important. Without it (the sacrifice of Christ), we, humanity, will NEVER achieve the level of holiness it takes to enter into His presence. This delightfully written account of Dr. Sproul's life is the story of a man dedicated to one thing, and who remained faithful in working towards that one thing. May it said about us all.

Falzter 5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Biography Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2024 Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase Super interesting background of a man I have respected for a long time. It’s great to see how it all came together. Read more Helpful Report NR 4.0 out of 5 stars A wonderful account of R.C. Sproul's life and legacy Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2021 Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase I've listened to many of R.C.'s sermons and teaching series, so to able to read more about the man behind them all was a true joy. This biography gives small peaks behind the curtain to who he was in private, as well as in-depth looks at his teaching, preaching, and, apologetic work. The reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 are: 1) While there are mentions of his personality and private life, I wish there had been more. In many ways this biography reads like a dictation of the work he did, which is of course to be expected and wanted, but still, it left me wanting in the way of disciplines, habits, prayer-life, and other, more private matters. 2) At times, the author repeats points that have been previously made, and at others, mentions points without expounding on them where it would have made sense to. Sometimes referencing a person, such as R.C. Sproul Jr., or a topic, then quickly moving along to another, seemingly unrelated point. With those things said, I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone looking to know more about R.C., the heart behind his work, and the ways that the Lord used him. It stirred my affections for God and left me deeply impacted by his dedication to God, His holiness, and making Him known. I will definitely be reading this account again in the future.

Mohler 5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic biography: hard to put down Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2021 Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase Written with great clarity and thoroughness, this biography about our generation's greatest theologian not only speaks to his life, but succinctly clarifies much of the theology that he taught to so many. This biography focuses mostly on Dr. Sproul's educational, teaching and pastoral occupations, and his professional relationships, but not so much on his immediate family.
