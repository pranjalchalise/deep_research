Degrees Ph.D., Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park B.A., Philosophy, Oberlin College Teaching Interests Most of my recent teaching has been in introductory computer science and advanced courses in artificial intelligence. In all of my courses I encourage students to work on projects related to their own interests, to conduct original research, and to explore connections between the material that we are covering and work in other disciplines across the liberal arts curriculum. I also teach courses that involve both computation and aspects of other disciplines such as cognitive science, social science, physics, evolutionary biology, and the arts. Beyond my courses, I direct an initiative on Artificial Intelligence in the Liberal Arts . Research Interests My primary research area is artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on computational methods that incorporate ideas from evolutionary biology. My interests are broader, however, and I have published in disciplines including psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, animal behavior, physics, mathematics, and engineering. Within evolutionary computation, I work primarily on genetic programming, which leverages random variation and selection to produce computer programs that solve specified problems. My students and I have made contributions both to the development of new genetic programming techniques and to the application of those techniques to difficult problems. Among the former are the Push programming language, which is a language not for human programmers but for evolutionary processes, and the lexicase selection algorithm for determining which programs should be reproduced, mutated, and recombined in order to solve problems most reliably and quickly. We have worked on applications in areas ranging from pure mathematics and quantum computer programming to wind turbine modeling and music composition. I also work on “Artificial Life” investigations into the emergence of behavior within ecosystems, human/machine collaboration on creative tasks, DNA computing, the modeling of dog and wolf behavior, the game theory of altruism and cooperation, the developmental neuroscience of human planning, knowledge representation for web agents, and the philosophy of computational theories of mind.
