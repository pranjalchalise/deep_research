What our Doctor of Business Administration students do Take content area courses in all business functions See how business functions interact and affect the workplace Construct and defend a dissertation in the final year Curriculum and degree requirements View full DBA degree requirements and course schedule Philosophy and objectives The 60-credit, three-year curriculum focuses on the most up-to-date professional and academic knowledge regarding key business issues. You’ll learn about the latest tools and techniques that can help you solve the organizational problems posed directly by fellow students experiencing the issues in their workplaces. The program's primary goal is to enable DBA students to become competent scholarly researchers and find effective solutions to advanced business problems. In contrast to solutions based on limited or no evidence, scholarly research encourages DBA students to review previously published work on the subject and to propose solutions based on an analysis of said work, along with data related to the topic. Students will demonstrate expertise in a specific field through an understanding of managerial and organizational contexts. Students will contribute to business knowledge and prepare for careers that apply research to practice. Students will demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical behavior. Students will demonstrate advanced research skills leading to an original, substantive applied research project. Coursework phase Students take classes with their cohort for two years. Coursework is focused on integrating business functions such as accounting, finance, management, marketing, and information technology, and the fundamentals of business research and statistics. Dissertation phase During their third year, students apply their training to complete an original research project. The dissertation is a significant work that will address a substantial question and contribute to solving a problem or advancing a strategy that addresses an important interest. Successful completion involves research, writing, and formal defense. The dissertation defense involves proposal defense and final defense phases. Candidates are expected to defend their proposal during the beginning of the third year – after they’ve completed all coursework – and to complete the final defense by the end of their third year. Doctoral dissertations are conducted one-on-one with DBA faculty committee in various functional areas, resulting in publications and other achievements .
