Sara Jensen Related To: Drishti May 5, 2022 Prasad Akella, founder of Drishti, says the company brings together artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technology to help optimize manual assembly processes in manufacturing operations. Combining AI and computer vision enables the creation of information so people in various roles of the business can execute their work at a different level—i.e., a more productive level. The bulk of manufacturing is done by people, says Akella, and before now there has not been much data coming from the manual lines operating within a manufacturing facility. But with Drishti’s technology data can be collected and visibility can be given into an operation. This allows companies to better analyze what processes may need to be improved and how they can go about doing so. It also offers opportunities to improve training by showing workers video of proper and improper procedures. Issues can be addressed in real time and from far distances using this technology, further benefiting manufacturers.
