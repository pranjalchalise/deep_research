Topics in this volume include: evolving developmental programs for neural networks solving multiple problems, tangled program, transfer learning and outlier detection using GP, program search for machine learning pipelines in reinforcement learning, automatic programming with GP, new variants of GP, like SignalGP, variants of lexicase selection, and symbolic regression and classification techniques. The volume includes several chapters on best practices and lessons learned from hands-on experience. Readers will discover large-scale, real-world applications of GP to a variety of problem domains via in-depth presentations of the latest and most significant results.
