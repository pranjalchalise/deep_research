In turn, foreign students have taken advantage of U.S. generosity and have become “forever” students, perpetually enrolled in higher education courses to remain in the U.S. Under President Trump’s proposed rule, the federal government would set the authorized admission and extension periods for foreign students and exchange visitors up to the duration of the program they are participating in, not to exceed a 4-year period. The rule would set the initial admission period for foreign media representatives at up to 240 days. Foreign media representatives would be eligible for an extension period of up to 240 days, but no longer than the length of the temporary activity or assignment. Additionally, admitting foreign students, exchange, and foreign media classifications for a fixed period of time would require said aliens to for apply for authorization to extend their stay with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), therefore requiring regular assessments by DHS for the alien to remain in the U.S. for a longer period. This would allow DHS to conduct proper oversight as part of SEVP and SEVIS by making access to necessary information more accessible and reducing the number of individuals here on visas. This proposed rule was first proposed under President Trump in 2020 but was withdrawn by the Biden Administration in 2021 much to the detriment of U.S. citizens and taxpayers. ### Topics Citizenship and Immigration Services Immigration and Customs Enforcement Keywords Student U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Visa Academic Program Immigration Reform Law Visa Overstay Last Updated: 08/28/2025 Was this page helpful?
