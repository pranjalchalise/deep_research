The official seal of Wichita State University anchors the ceremonial anaglyph and is encircled by two hyperbolic forms designed to complement the university mace. The presidential medallion is suspended from black silk trimmed with gold. The University Mace As the official symbol of the university’s authority and power, the mace is carried by selected college faculty in the academic procession. The mace was commissioned in 1978 by Paul J. Magelli, former dean of Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, as a memorial to his twin brother, Peter M. Magelli, and presented for the first time at the 1980 commencement. Designed by artist Jonathan Graham Bonner of Providence, Rhode Island, the mace is executed primarily in stainless steel, gold and silver. The head of the mace is a gilt frame with 22 stainless steel spikes. The points are sterling silver. A silver ball engraved with the three seals of Wichita State University—Fairmount College, the Municipal University of Wichita and Wichita State University—is suspended in the frame by two springs. The shaft is a stainless steel spring, and the handle is a gilt ball set with nine hematites. The University Seal The seal of Wichita State University incorporates many images. A farmer and an Indian, representing Kansas’ rural background and Native American heritage, are looking up at seven stars above a lamp of learning. The university’s name arcs above these images. Below them is a sunflower flanked by wheat, again signifying Kansas, and a laurel, a symbol of learning. Three significant dates of the university’s past also are included: 1895, Fairmount College founding; 1926, University of Wichita reorganization date; and 1964, the date the university entered the Kansas Regents’ system.

The academic gown is the basic garment and by tradition is black for all degrees and ranks. The square caps or mortarboards are part of the prescribed academic dress. Accompanying the gowns are hoods lined with silk in the ofcial color of the institution conferring the degree and bordered in the color representing the discipline of learning. The color of the tassel designates the student’s degree and may vary from what is found on the hood. Students receiving graduate degrees wear the color appropriate to the degree emphasis. Drab • W.
