  "data": "Technology Pioneers 2019 The Technology Pioneers of 2019 bring together 56 early to growth-stage companies from around the world that are pioneering new technologies and innovations ranging from the use of artificial intelligence to fight human trafficking, driverless trucks, quantum computing systems, compostable packaging, and blockchain solutions to tackle disinformation. By joining this community, Technology Pioneers begin a two-year journey where they are part of the World Economic Forumâs initiatives, activities and events, bringing cutting-edge insights and fresh thinking to critical global discussions. Good data drives good decisions. But manufacturers have historically lacked sufficient data on human actions. Consequently, they have traded people for robots, giving up flexibility. In contrast, Drishti's unique dataset on manual operations extends human potential for true digital transformation. Despite robotics hype, humans are manufacturingâs largest value creators. But methods for measuring human activity have not changed since Henry Ford. Manufacturers struggle to optimize human tasks at scale. Some believe human efficiency has peaked. Drishtiâs pioneering computer vision uses artificial intelligence (AI) to digitize human activities in the factory and allows manufacturers to benefit from human analytics for the first time. Drishtiâs dataset drives a future in which technology does not displace people; it makes them more valuable."
