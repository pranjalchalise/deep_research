However, the Student Life Office seeks to provide support, encouragement, and advice as needed and desired by the students. The Director of Campus Activities and Greek Life works with groups and their advisors to develop leadership and organizational strength and to help co-curricular life contribute to the enhanced development of students and the educational mission of the institution. Contact the Director of Campus Activities and Greek Life for a current listing of all student organizations. This list is also available on Centre’s website. Students are encouraged to organize and join groups that promote their common interests. A group shall become an official organization when registered by the institution through the Student Life Office and Student Government Association. The College believes in the co-curricular experience and its potential contribution to building community. Centre delegates authority and responsibility for student organization activity along the following line: Board of Trustees, President, Vice President of Student Life, and Dean of Students or designee, and heads of student organizations. Registered student organizations must have purposes and objectives which are compatible with the mission of Centre College, though institutional registration does not indicate endorsement by the College of the aims, objectives, or policies of that organization. A student group must be an officially registered student organization in order to use the Centre College name, to be listed in official publications, to advertise on campus, and to be recognized by the Student Government Association and be eligible to receive funds allocated from the student activities fee. Registration Process Student groups that desire to be officially registered at Centre College must submit an Application for Student Organization Registration to the Student Life Office. At a minimum, organizations will be asked to provide: the name and signature of an advisor, who is a current faculty or staff member of Centre College, a list of current officers and members, a statement of purpose and/or constitution. All constitutional documents of student organizations, such as charters, constitution By-Laws, regulations, policies, etc., are subject to administrative review and to approval by the Student Life Office. Student organizations at Centre College must operate in compliance with college policy and local, State, and Federal law. Organizations must also operate in compliance with their own approved constitution and/or By-Laws. The Student Life Office and/or SGA reserves the right to deny registration or to withdraw registration from any organization whose purpose or activities are deemed inconsistent with the mission, values, or policies of the institution. Organizations must register annually, or as often as requested by the Student Life Office, and must inform the Student Life Office of any changes to the information supplied on the registration form as often as such information may change. Action by the Student Government Association may grant an organization registered status. To be recognized, the group must be approved by the Student Government Association (see Article IV, Section 3 of the Student Government Association Constitution). A group must be registered and recognized in order to receive funding from the Student Government Association. Social fraternities and sororities follow a similar but separate annual recognition process which is outlined in The Statement of Mutual Responsibility between Centre College and its Social Fraternities and Sororities and lease agreements between the College and each Greek Organization.
