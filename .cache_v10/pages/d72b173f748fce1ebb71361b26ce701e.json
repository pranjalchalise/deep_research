  "data": "When wishes are made real: Bvlgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin visits the pre-schools built by Bvlgari and Save the Children in Za’atari The largest Syrian refugee camp in the region is in Za’atari: established in 2012 to temporarily host the Syrians fleeing the violence of civil war, it has become a city made of prefabricated buildings. Covering 5.2 km 2 , today almost 80,000 people live there. During humanitarian emergencies, access to education seems to take second place, yet it should not be a luxury but a right for every child. Bvlgari and Save the Children strongly believe in the value of education and have been supporting Syrian refugee children in Jordan since 2014, with a key focus on pre-school children in Za’atari and, later, starting from 2017, in Azraq refugee camp. With an investment of over US$3.7M so far, Bvlgari and Save the Children have built or restructured 3 kindergartens in Za’atari and 1 in Azraq, and have already improved lives of over 16,000 at risk children below 5 years old in Jordan, providing a protective and safe learning environment for these children. In consideration of the magnitude of this emergency, Bvlgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin, was keen to see for himself what the organization was doing in the refugee camp, joining for the first time a field visit out of Italy. Showing a strong commitment to children and to their right not only to dream, but to actually have a better future, on his visit he announced that in 2018 Bvlgari will donate to Save the Children US$1.2M to further support the organization’s activities in Za’atari: “This field visit in the largest Syrian refugees camp, a few miles off the Syrian-Jordan border, further confirms the fundamental importance of kids education as a major driver for development, growth and well-being of children in this unstable region as much as generally speaking on our planet. The Early Learning Centers and related human resources put in place in Za’atari by Bvlgari together with Save the Children allow thousands of young kids and their parents to benefit from inspiring coaching and support to shape a new and better life after the devastating ordeal they have experienced in recent years. I’m very proud that as a private company, and with the support of our 5,000 passionate collaborators worldwide, we contribute financially to these major initiatives which have a game changing impact on so many precious lives. Up to today, Bvlgari has donated $3.7 million and I’m very honored to announce that this contribution won’t stop as we are planning to invest over one more million in 2018. Kids are the real gems of mankind and their smiles and dreams provide Bvlgari with an ultimate sense of purpose”. Together with the President of Save the Children Italy Claudio Tesauro, Jean-Christophe Babin visited the Charity’s various humanitarian and education programs, including daily bread distribution to the entire population of the camp. The most rewarding part of the visit was when he spent time in two of the three pre-schools built by Bvlgari and Save the Children where specially-trained educators run high-quality early childhood education programs for almost 4,000 children aged 3 to 4. Immersed in an expanse of white prefabricated buildings and tents, these kindergartens allow children to discover the colors of the world. “The Early Learning Centers Bulgari supports have enriched children’s lives in so many ways,” said Rania Malki, CEO of Save the Children Jordan. “They are the founding stone to proper child development and prosperous future.” Humanity and audacity are the common threads of these stories, attitude and values that Bvlgari and Save the Children sustain and encourage. When we make a wish, its magic lasts for just a moment. But if we dare to make it true, then it is turned into something real, beautiful, enduring. Indeed, it is thanks to almost a decade of shared care, determination and audacity that Bvlgari and Save the Children, hand in hand, have helped thousands of children to see their wishes made real. “Nine years ago, we embarked on a partnership with Save the Children with an audacious dream: to help empower millions of children to build a better future for themselves through the power of education.” – says Bvlgari CEO Jean Christophe Babin. “Because we know that just like a precious piece of jewelery, a wish is first imagined. Almost a decade later, we are proud of the dream we had – and the audacity we have shown with Save the Children in making it real: helping over a million children dream great. Now we move forward. With ambition, with audacity of hope, with a commitment to excellence, and steadfast determination to make many more wishes come true. Because a dream can last forever when it’s #madereal.” “Madereal” will be the new communication theme of 2018 for the partnership, which will allow Bvlgari and Save the Children to tell and celebrate the stories of those who, thanks to this partnership, have changed their own lives with determination and audacity. Since beginning its unique partnership in 2009 with Save the Children, Bvlgari has raised US$80M globally so far through sales of the Save the Children jewelry collection and retailing the ring at US$560, the bracelet at US$580 and a pendant at US$620, of which US$100 goes to the charity. Funds raised through the partnership, have been invested in 100 projects in 33 countries, reaching more than one million at-risk children and youth through education, emergency response, poverty reduction, and youth empowerment programs. The initiatives mostly aim to provide access to quality education, targeting the most vulnerable children on the planet, in areas where natural disaster, armed or political conflict, social exclusion, disability or poverty put their right to an education and a better future at risk, or destroy it. Recognising the power of education not just to transform, Bvlgari has partnered with Save the Children since 2009. Bvlgari helps fund the non-profit’s activities with proceeds from the Save the Children jewellery collection, custom-designed jewels, inspired by the iconic B.zero1 line. According to President of Save the Children Italy Claudio Tesauro: “There are 15,000 children below 4 years old who live in Za’atari and have never seen anything beyond the desolation of this camp. Since 2014, Save the Children is here with Bvlgari to guarantee a place where, every day, these children can grow up learning and playing in a positive and stimulating environment. Like little Khaled who, thanks to our centers, strengthened his self-esteem and today dreams of becoming an inventor to build a wheel chair for his brother who can’t walk. Khaled and the children I have met here are the future of Syria.” The Bvlgari Save the Children jewellery collection comprising of the pendant necklace, bracelet and ring is available at all Bvlgari boutiques in sterling silver with black ceramic accents. bvlgari Jean-Christophe Babin Save the Children Share.
