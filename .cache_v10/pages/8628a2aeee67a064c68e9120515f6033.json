  "data": "The role of brand identity, brand lifestyle congruence, and brand satisfaction on repurchase intention: a multi-group structural equation model Download PDF Download PDF Subjects Business and management Operational research Abstract This study investigated the relationship between brand identity, brand lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and repurchase intention. In addition, this study examined how the primary reference group’s family and peer/friend affected individuals’ perceptions of brand identity, brand-lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and purchase intention through a multi-group structural equation model. A total of 610 valid and useable responses, collected from a social media channel, were analyzed. Grounded in social identity theory and self-congruity theory, a set of hypotheses was examined within a research model. The findings show that brand identity significantly affects brand lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and repurchase intentions. In addition, brand-lifestyle congruence significantly affects brand satisfaction and repurchase intentions, with brand satisfaction also significantly affecting purchase intentions. Also, high-income and elderly consumers tend to ignore the family and peer effects. Middle-aged, middle-income men who value product origin show a strong brand perception, and are less influenced by family. In contrast, women, typically lower-income and price-focused, are more receptive to family and peer effects and generally indifferent to product origin. This research advances brand identity literature by examining the effects of brand brand-lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and purchase intention. It suggests that the synergy between brand identity, brand lifestyle congruence, and brand satisfaction significantly enhances repurchase intentions. Besides, examining profiles in the context of brands, consumers, and reference groups contributes additional value to the field.

These factors are closely related to the development of different lifestyles, personal identity, and self-concept (Haanpää, 2007 ). An essential element of identity influencing consumption and group membership is national identity (Black and Veloutsou, 2017 ). Moreover, brands act as critical cultural symbols, and the meanings they convey are pivotal in establishing harmony between consumers and brands (Hollenbeck et al. 2008 ). Haanpää ( 2007 ) stated that post-modern consumer society’s pursuit of diversity and freedom of choice creates various social identities and lifestyles. Although the impact of lifestyle on purchasing is often underrecognized by consumers, it is crucial in shaping consumption practices (Suyanto et al. 2019 ). The dynamic nature of changing lifestyles supports the development of individual purchasing styles and decision-making (Haanpää, 2007 ), which are further influenced by factors such as personalities, past purchasing experiences, and ages (Adnan et al. 2017 ). This interaction between individual traits and societal influences culminates in a consumer behavior pattern where individuals purchase identities rather than mere products. They seek to express their lifestyles through these choices, prioritizing expression over functional needs (Arunyanart and Utiswannakul, 2019 ). Therefore, every purchase behavior related to consumption is intertwined with identity and lifestyle (Suyanto et al. 2019 ). Brand identity communicates to consumers what a brand provides or stands for, focuses on meeting consumers’ symbolic needs more than their functional needs, and communicates uniqueness and the status and prestige offered by the brand compared to competitors through brand distinctiveness and brand prestige. (Alnawas and Altarifi, 2016 : 114). So, brand identity is an important element of differentiation in a crowded market by conveying to consumers what a brand stands for and focusing on their symbolic rather than functional needs (Alnawas and Altarifi, 2016 ). It not only meets consumer needs but also communicates the uniqueness and status offered by the brand, which is essential given the extensive array of brand options available (Da Silveira et al. 2013a ). Patagonia, for example, targets environmentally conscious consumers with its strong commitment to sustainability and its “Worn Wear” campaign, encouraging the purchase of used products to support eco-friendly lifestyles. Similarly, Apple’s aligns with tech-savvy individuals through its emphasis on innovation and simplicity, while Whole Foods Market attracts health-conscious shoppers with its emphasis on organic and natural foods (Konuk, 2023 ). Moreover, Red Bull creates a brand identity around extreme sports and energy, appealing to adventure-seekers and athletes. These examples show how brand identity not only reflects but also shapes consumer behavior and preferences. This strategic alignment of brand identities with consumer lifestyles not only segments the market effectively but also significantly influences consumer behavior and brand loyalty (Holt, 2002 ; Nam et al. 2011a ). Furthermore, brand identity is deeply influenced by cultural factors, which further shape and define the relationship between consumers and brands (Coleman et al. 2011 ). These interactions highlight how cultural contexts and consumer lifestyle choices interplay to mold brand perception and consumer engagement. Despite extensive studies on consumer behavior and brand identity, a significant gap persists in understanding the role of social identities and reference groups in shaping interactions between brand identity and lifestyle choices, particularly within culturally diverse and developing markets like Türkiye. The influences of internal and external reference groups, such as family and friends, on consumer choices have not been sufficiently explored, especially regarding how these groups mediate the relationship between consumer self-concept, lifestyle alignment, and brand preferences. This research delves into these understudied dynamics and addresses a critical gap in the literature. It proposes a comprehensive approach to understanding the nuanced factors influencing consumer decisions in non-Western contexts. This study investigated the relationship between brand identity, brand lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and repurchase intention, with a particular focus on how reference groups affect these dynamics within the Turkish consumer market (Le-Hoang, 2020 ; Mi et al. 2019 ; Ozdemir et al. 2020 ; Veloutsou and Moutinho, 2009 ; Wang et al. 2012 ; Wei and Yu, 2012 ; Yang et al. 2007 ). By exploring these relationships, the study offers empirical evidence that enhances the understanding of brand loyalty and consumer engagement, considering the social systems that consumers operate within. The findings enrich theoretical discussions and provide practical implications for marketers, helping them to tailor their strategies to align more closely with the social identities and lifestyles of their target demographics. This comprehensive approach both addresses a critical gap in the literature and enhances the academic and practical knowledge of brand management and consumer psychology in a culturally rich setting. Literature review Brand identity Brand identity comprises a set of strategic tools used by organizations to enhance visibility, differentiate from competitors, and build brand value and consumer loyalty (Keller, 1993 : Wheeler, 2014 ). It serves to connect customers with a brand, offering a mix of tangible and intangible benefits that foster a strong brand-customer relationship (Aaker and Keller, 1996 ). Within branding literature, brand identity is seen as an internal, enduring framework within a corporation (Koporcic and Halinen, 2018 ), shaping customer perceptions and interactions with the brand (Törmala and Gyrd-Jones, 2017 ). Iglesias et al. ( 2020 ) defined it as the amalgamation of a firm’s intended image and the commitments it makes to its clients, which are crucial for conveying the brand’s identity and values to both external and internal stakeholders (Essamri et al. 2019 ). The strategic approach of a brand identity is vital, influencing the brand’s market success by fostering trust, ensuring distinctiveness, and enhancing customer commitment (Malaska Saraniemi and Tahtinen, 2011 ; Muhonen et al. 2017 ). It includes developing a value proposition that offers practical, emotional, and self-expressive advantages (Gustafson and Pomirleanu, 2021 ), thus establishing significant connections with clients and reinforcing long-term loyalty. Overall, a well-defined brand identity not only supports a business’s strategic goals but also plays a crucial role in building lasting bonds between the brand and its customers, encompassing more than mere visual features or logos (Essamri et al. 2019 ; Iglesias et al. 2020 ). Brand-lifestyle congurence Brand-lifestyle congruence is a pivotal concept that captures the alignment between a brand’s ethos and the individual lifestyles of its customers. Lifestyle, encompassing individual psychological preferences, values, beliefs, and consumption patterns, significantly influences consumer behavior (Coursaris and Van Osch, 2015 ; Díaz et al. 2017 ; Holt, 2002 ; Li et al. 2018 ). It serves as a powerful means for individuals to convey their identities and preferences, often through the brands they choose (Li et al. 2018 ). This expression is not limited to any single domain but is evident across various aspects of life, including food preferences, which can reflect broader lifestyle choices (Jang et al. 2011 ). Importantly, lifestyle is a more significant predictor of consumer behavior than demographic factors, making it crucial for brands to understand and align with the lifestyles of their target markets (Tangsupwattana and Liu, 2017 ). Brands that successfully resonate with the lifestyles of their consumers are more likely to foster strong loyalty, as customers tend to gravitate towards brands that reflect their personal values and lifestyles (Alnawas and Altarifi, 2015 ; Catalin and Andreea, 2014 ; Nam et al. 2011b ; Solomon, 2015 ). Such alignment offers symbolic benefits that are as important as the functional aspects of a product, thereby enhancing consumer satisfaction and promoting repeat purchases (Nam et al. 2011a ; Sharma et al. 2018 ). Moreover, understanding and monitoring the evolving lifestyles of consumers can help brands stay relevant and maintain a positive relationship with their audience. This connection leads to increased brand loyalty and purchasing behavior driven by emotional connections with the brand (Çifci et al. 2016 ; Ekinci et al. 2013 ). Brand satisfaction Brand satisfaction is a critical measure of a consumer’s appraisal of a product or service post-purchase, determined by comparing their initial expectations against the actual performance (Tse and Wilton, 1988 ). Tu and Chang ( 2012 ) stated that satisfaction can manifest in two forms: transaction-specific, which focuses on individual purchase experiences, and accumulative, which considers the overall experience with a product over time (Wardani and Gustia, 2016 ; Zboja and Voorhees, 2006 ). A positive brand experience triggers a favorable attitude towards the brand, significantly influencing consumer loyalty (Chen-Yu et al. 2017 ; Cheng et al. 2019 ). Grisaffe and Nguyen ( 2011 ) defined brand satisfaction as the comprehensive assessment of a brand by consumers, reflecting the depth of their contentment with the product or service. This satisfaction fosters trust in the brand, enhancing the likelihood of repeat purchases (Chinomona, 2013 ; Cuong, 2020 ). Further, empirical studies have shown that satisfaction not only predicts brand trust but also increases brand preference. Consumers who are satisfied are more likely to choose the same brand repeatedly (Shin, et al. 2019 ). This preference develops because satisfied customers experience a deeper emotional connection with the brand, which reflects the alignment of the brand’s performance with their expectations. (Chinomona et al. 2013 ; Grisaffe and Nguyen, 2011 ). Repurchase intention Ismail and Ismail ( 2022 ) characterized repurchase intention as a critical metric in consumer behavior. It reflects the likelihood that a customer will buy a product again after an initial purchase (Taylor and Baker, 1994 ). This intention is often gauged by how consumers evaluate the performance of a product relative to their expectations (Ismail and Ismail, 2022 ). Han et al. ( 2020 ) described it as the culmination of the purchasing decision-making process, where consumers assess the service and product quality they received. This evaluation is crucial as it influences overall purchasing behavior and can accurately predict future buying behavior. Satisfaction plays an important role here; consumers compare their initial expectations with the actual product performance, and this comparison dictates their future purchasing decisions (Oliver, 1980 ). Han et al. ( 2019 ) further emphasized that positive reactions to product performance or quality foster strong repurchase intentions. Achieving high customer repurchase intentions is crucial for brands aiming to improve their market reputation and worth (Yin et al. 2022 ). Influence of reference groups and theoretical integration Reference groups significantly influence consumer behavior by shaping their perceptions, attitudes, and brand preferences, as explained by social identity theory. According to Tajfel and Turner ( 1986 ), this theory posits that individuals derive aspects of their identity from the groups to which they belong, which in turn guides their behavior and preferences. This is particularly relevant in culturally rich markets like Türkiye, where consumer decisions are heavily influenced by both internal and external reference groups, such as family and social networks. Ekinci et al. ( 2013 ) emphasized that lifestyle serves as a tangible reference point influenced by social identities, while brand identity is supported by more abstract aspects of self-concept. Further studies by Carrillo Barbosa and Guzmán Rincón ( 2022 ) and Castillo-Abdul et al. ( 2022 ) illustrated how companies create social systems and relationships tailored to specific demographic and cultural realities, thus applying theoretical insights to practical marketing strategies. These dynamics between social identity and consumer behavior highlight the importance of understanding reference groups in developing effective marketing strategies that resonate well with target demographics, which enhances brand loyalty and consumer engagement. This comprehensive approach not only strengthens the paper’s theoretical framework but also provides a solid foundation for practical applications in non-Western markets. Hypothesis development Relationships between the study variables Self-concept is a useful theoretical framework for understanding consumer decision-making. Research has indicated that customers tend to choose brands that align with their self-perception or desired self-image (Landon, 1974 ; Malhotra, 1988 ; Sirgy, 2018 ). Several studies have explored how consumers express their identities through interactions with brand personalities (Belk, 1988 ; Dolich, 1969 ; Malhotra, 1988 ). In psychology, self-concept (also called self-image) is described as “the totality of the individual’s thoughts and feelings having reference to himself/herself as an object” (Wang et al. 2021 , p. 177). Self-congruity is a logical extension of self-concept. It plays a critical role in predicting consumer behavior, a concept widely accepted in psychology, marketing, and other disciplines (Sop and Kozak, 2019 ). The self-congruity theory posits that people choose brands or products that match their self-concept (Kumar, 2016 ). Research based on this theory contends that customer perception of brand self-congruence influences their choices and purchasing decisions (Kumar, 2022 ; Sirgy et al. 2016 ). Greater brand self-congruence fosters customer satisfaction, belief, and loyalty toward the brand (Li and Peng, 2021 ; Sirgy et al. 2016 ; Wang et al. 2019 ). The relationship between brand self-congruity and brand identity is centered on how customers assess the extent to which a brand’s identity aligns with their own when choosing or forming a connection with it (Kumar, 2016 ; Usakli and Baloglu, 2011 ). Consumers who perceive a strong alignment between their identity and a brand’s identity are more likely to have a favorable attitude and preference toward that brand (Lee and Jeong, 2014 ). This alignment strengthens the connection between brand perception and customer loyalty. A strong brand identity helps consumers develop an affinity for the brand and develop strong relationships. Moreover, a clear brand identity satisfies consumer’s desire for uniqueness while simultaneously enhancing self-esteem through brand prestige (Alnawas and Altarifi, 2016 ). Lifestyle is another crucial elements of common consumption culture that reflects time, money, and consumer identity (Manthiou et al. 2018 ). Aro et al. ( 2018 ) found that consumers prefer brands that reflect their identity and lifestyle over those that do not. Companies such as Patagonia, Apple, Whole Foods Market, and Red Bull exemplify this relationship in their marketing strategies. Therefore, brand identity establishes a relationship between the brand and the customer (Mao et al. 2020 ). Examining these real-world relationships offers valuable insights and expands the academic literature. H 1 : Brand identity positively affects brand lifestyle congruence . Brand identity significantly affects the way consumers perceive and value a brand (He et al. 2012 ). A strong brand identity meets both a consumer’s functional needs and their symbolic ones, which strengthens their bonds with the brand and increasing loyalty (Coleman et al. 2011 ). The stronger the brand identity, the greater is the consumer identification and satisfaction with that brand. According to brand relationship theory, a strong consumer–brand relationship reduces the likelihood of consumers switching to competing brands (Casidy et al. 2018 ). This theory assumes that consumers personify brands and consider them partners. When a strong brand relationship is established, consumers feel satisfied with the brand. In this context, brand identity increases the quality and depth of consumer–brand relationships, thus positively affecting brand satisfaction. A strong brand identity leads consumers to perceive the brand as more valuable and feel more satisfied with their relationship with it. H 2 : Brand identity positively affects brand satisfaction . When consumers believe that a brand’s identity aligns with their own, it enhances their connection to the business and increases their likelihood of making repeat purchases (Dennis et al. 2016 ). For instance, Patagonia emphasizes its eco-friendly practices and reducing its carbon footprint. This aligns with environmentally conscious customers, who are thus more inclined to buy and remain loyal to Patagonia. The perceived alignment between brand and consumer identity positively influences the consumer–brand relationship and increases repurchase intentions, as consumers are likely to revisit a brand that reflects their identity (He et al. 2012 ). Mao et al. ( 2020 ) found a significant positive effect between brand identity and purchase intention. Consumers were more inclined to repurchase and remain loyal to a brand when they perceive its identity aligns with their own values, attitudes, or lifestyles (Prentice et al. 2019 ). H 3 : Brand identity positively affects repurchase intention . Grzeskowiak et al. ( 2016 ) noted that brand satisfaction depends on the alignment between a consumer’s identity and the brand. Lifestyle, which refers to the daily wishes and needs of individuals, is also a reflection of the consumer identity (Mathieu et al. 2018 ). Brands that align their identities with customer lifestyles better meet consumer needs (Augusto and Torres, 2018 ). Compared to brands that focus solely on products, those that cater to lifestyle provide consumers with richer experiences, amusement, enjoyment, and satisfaction (Sina and Kim, 2019 ). According to Nam et al. ( 2011a ), lifestyle congruence significantly affects customer satisfaction with the brand. H 4 : Brand-lifestyle congruence positively affects brand satisfaction . Brand-lifestyle congruence strengthens brand loyalty as individuals form emotional bonds with brands that align with their lifestyles (Haanpää, 2007 ). Consumers establish these bonds when they perceive that a brand understands their lifestyles and aligns with their values (Li et al. 2012 ). Therefore, individuals are inclined to exhibit loyalty and consistently opt for that brand over its competitors (Tangsupwattana and Liu, 2017 ). The sense of loyalty and emotional bond leads consumers to consider repurchasing the brand owing to the favorable emotions linked to it (Pan et al. 2018 ). Moreover, satisfaction positively affects purchase intention (Alnawas and Aburub, 2016 ; Carlson et al. 2019 ; Li and Fang, 2019 ; Park et al. 2019 ). Satisfied customers trust a brand more, and when consistently satisfied with their experiences, they may view the brand as trustworthy. Trust leads to a stronger desire to repurchase (Trivedi and Yadav, 2020 ). H 5 : Brand-lifestyle congruence positively affects repurchase intention . H 6 : Brand satisfaction positively affects repurchase intention . The role of reference group The concept of social identity refers to the aspect of self-image that emerges from an individual’s sense of belonging to a social group and the emotional value attached to this affiliation (Tajfel, 1974 ). According to social identity theory, people form a unique personal identity and a social identity based on their group affiliation (Bao et al. 2017 ). In addition, the theory states that shared attitudes and personality traits activate cultural patterns, which prompts individuals to achieve a positive social identity by associating with desirable groups (Pentina et al. 2013 ). People exhibit similar behaviors within their group and differing behaviors outside of it (Jiang et al. 2016 ). Group members also tend to prioritize maintaining the group’s image and identity (Shimul and Phau, 2023 ). Hence, social identity theory is expected to clarify customer brand self-congruence, emotional attachment to brand identity, and inter-group interactions influencing repurchase experiences. Scholars employ social identity theory to analyze the impact of reference groups on brand identity (Escalas and Bettman, 2003 ; White and Dahl, 2007 ). Reference groups directly affect the consumer–brand relationship (Veloutsou and Moutinho, 2009 ). White and Dahl ( 2006 ) categorized them into in-groups (family, peers, etc.) and out-groups (aspirational groups, dissociative groups, etc.). “In-group” or “member group” refers to a group that the consumer belongs to. Aligning brand identity with the in-group might increase the consumer–brand relationship (Escalas and Bettman, 2003 ). Family and peers impact consumer–brand relationships or brand loyalty at different levels. Family advice is often trusted due to familiarity, while peer influence supports brand choice through shared experiences and a sense of belonging, though in a less authoritarian manner (Girard, 2010 ; Nolan et al. 2008 ). H7: The family effect within the reference group moderates the entire model . H8: The peer/friend effect within the reference group moderates the entire model . As a result, the research model shown in Fig. 1 was established. In Study 2, the effect of the reference group on consumer profiling was also assessed using multiple correspondence analysis. Fig. 1 Research model. Full size image Methodology Preparing the data set The questionnaires were translated from English to Turkish by three academicians fluent in English and familiar with marketing literature. They ensured the face validity of the scales based on their expertise. Two additional academicians conducted back-translations to verify accuracy. Before beginning the data collection process, a pilot test was conducted to evaluate the clarity of the survey with 75 participants. Data collection The target audience was consumers aged 18 and older who regularly use brands. Respondents were asked to choose their favorite brand and fill out a questionnaire based on their choice. A convenience sampling method was used for cost and time efficiency. The survey was administered online via Google Drive, and social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) were used to distribute the surveys. Data collection started and ended in early 2020. After excluding incomplete responses, 610 valid questionnaires remained. Participation was voluntary, and no incentives were provided. Among the participants, 53.9% were women, and 46.1% were men. In terms of income, 39.8% earned 3000₺ (Turkish lira) or less (around the minimum wage), while 48.4% had an income between 3001₺ and 7000₺, placing them in the middle-income group. The remaining 11.8% earned 7000₺ or more, classifying them as high-income. Regarding education, 12.9% had an associate degree or lower, 54.3% had an undergraduate degree, and 32.8% had postgraduate education, indicating a well-educated sample. Participants were from various regions of Türkiye. Most participants (46.4%) were from the Mediterranean region, while the Black Sea region had the lowest representation (2.8%). This broad representation provides a general trend across Türkiye. In terms of industry preferences, the most liked sector was clothing (32.8%), followed by automotive (17%), technology (14.1%), and sportswear (9.8%). Other sectors ranged between 0.2 and 3.4%. Most participants (92.8%) reported that their friends and peers also use the same brand, and 79.5% said their family members did, too. For 42.3% of respondents, product pricing was a primary consideration, while 57.7% prioritized brand. In addition, 48.4% followed the brand on social media, but only 27% were members of brand communities both online and offline. Measures All constructs were measured using seven-point Likert-type scales, anchored from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (7). The brand identity scale, adapted from Torres et al. ( 2017 ), consisted of five items, and the repurchase intention scale, adapted from the same source, had three items. The brand-lifestyle congruence scale, adapted from Nam et al. ( 2011a ), consisted of three items. Brand satisfaction, measured using three items, was adapted from Davvetas and Diamantopoulos ( 2017 ). To identify the reference group, participants were asked, “Do your family members use or have used the brand you chose?” and “Do your friends or peers use or have used the brand you chose?” Responses were used to classify participants into the appropriate reference groups. Data analysis and results Structural equation modeling (SEM), a statistical method based on covariance, was used, and the maximum likelihood method, which assumes multivariate normality of the variables, was applied. The first stage involved confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to determine how well the theoretical model aligns with reality, testing measurement theory by matching theoretical constructs to measured variables (Hair et al. 2014a ). Once confirmed by CFA, the relationships between these constructs were then examined. This approach is preferred because it accurately examines simultaneous relationships and aims to reveal causal relationships between variables. The structural equation model represents the theory with sets of structural equations, depicted with a visual diagram (Hair et al. 2014b ). To address the difficulty of testing multivariate normality, univariate normality was provided for each variable and its corresponding items (Hair et al. 2014a ). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests revealed that the variables were not normally distributed ( p value = 0.00 for all variables). However, skewness and kurtosis values ranged between −1 and +1, and the Q-Q plot provided in Appendix 1 illustrates the distribution. Also, the central limit theorem assumes that for sufficiently large sample sizes, the distribution of sample means will approximate normality regardless of the variables’ distributions (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007 ). Study 1 Measurement model Four constructs were measured using 14 items. Hu and Bentler ( 1999 ) indicated that the d indices exceed the threshold values. Table 1 presents the results of the CFA. Table 1 Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results. Full size table The reliability and convergent validity were confirmed as the composite reliability exceeds 0.7 and the AVE is above 0.5 (Hair et al. 2014a ). Table 2 also shows that discriminant validity was achieved. Table 2 The results of the inter-construct correlations and AVE value. Full size table Common method bias (CMB) occurs when a single factor explains most of the variance (Gaskin and Lim, 2016 ; Podsakoff et al. 2003 ). The single-factor Harman test was performed to determine whether one factor captured most of the variance. The explained variance rate was 45%. However, given the weakness of this test, the CMB was re-examined using the directly measured latent methods factor approach suggested by Podsakoff et al. ( 2003 ). With an equally restricted regression path of 0.58, the variance explained was 34%. Since the CMB does not exceed 50%, it is either absent or insignificant. Structural model According to Hu and Bentler ( 1999 ), all indexes exceed the threshold values, indicating alignment between theory and reality. Table 3 and Fig. 2 present these results. Table 3 Results of the direct effect. Full size table Fig. 2 The results of the structural equation model. Full size image Table 3 shows that brand identity significantly affects brand-lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and repurchase intention. Similarly, brand-lifestyle congruence significantly affects brand satisfaction and repurchase intention, while brand satisfaction significantly affects purchase intention. The model accounts for 14% of the variance in brand-lifestyle congruence, 51% in brand satisfaction, and 56% in repurchase intention. Multi-group structural equation modeling and analysis results Multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to compare the regression paths between variables. Previous research demonstrated the value of multi-group SEM for examining variables like culture (Babin et al. 2016 ), demographics (Huang and Ge, 2019 ), store design (Murray et al. 2017 ), and marital status (Aka and Buyukdag, 2021 ). This method provides a detailed analysis of consumer behavior. Multi-group SEM examines whether causal relationships between simultaneous events vary based on different moderating variables, allowing inferences regarding different demographic or psychographic variables. This study examined how family and peer/friend reference groups affect perceptions of brand identity, brand-lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and purchase intention. The chi-square/df value for multi-group SEM was 2.772, comparative fit index (CFI) was 0.961, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value was 0.051, goodness-of-fit index (GFI) was 0.924, and adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) was 0.887, indicating a strong fit. The chi-square difference for the family effect was 34.53, with a df difference of 16, indicating no significant difference between models ( p = 0.78). There is a significant difference between constrained and unconstrained models for the family effect ( p = 0.005). Regarding the peer effect, the chi-square difference was 24.545, and the df difference was 16. There was no significant difference between constrained and unconstrained models for peer influence ( p = 0.078). Peer/friend effects on each path were analyzed to identify any significant differences in local paths, as shown in Table 4 and Fig. 3 . Table 4 Multi-group SEM results. Full size table Fig. 3 The results of the multi-group SEM. Full size image The relationship between brand identity and brand-lifestyle congruence was significant when participants were influenced by family, but insignificant without that influence. This result shows the moderating effect of family. The peer/friend effect did not moderate this relationship, as it was significant regardless. Brand identity significantly influenced brand satisfaction with and without family effect. This result indicates that family did not moderate this relationship. The peer effect, however, moderated brand satisfaction, showing influence in its presence, but not without it. Also, peer effect did not moderate the relationship between brand identity and brand satisfaction. The effect of brand identity on repurchase intention was significant with both family and peer effects, but not without them, and neither effect moderated the relationship. The effect of brand-lifestyle congruence on brand satisfaction was statistically significant with and without family effect, and family moderated this relationship. The peer effect did not moderate this relationship, despite being significant in both cases. The relationship between brand-lifestyle congruence and repurchase intention was significant with and without peer effects, but the peer effect moderated this relationship. For consumers without the peer effect, brand-lifestyle congruence had a higher effect on repurchase intention than those with the peer effect. Therefore, even without peer effect, a strong alignment between brand and lifestyle causes individuals to adopt the brand and show higher repurchase intentions. The relationship between brand satisfaction and repurchase intention was significant regardless of the family effect, which moderated the relationship. Although this relationship was significant with and without peer effect, the peer effect did not moderate this relationship. Satisfaction had a lower impact on repurchase intentions with family involvement, while consumers with no family effects were more satisfaction-oriented. This relationship indicates that consumers continue their past habits and make purchases even if less satisfied. However, those without family effects are more satisfaction-oriented. Brand-lifestyle congruence accounted for 22.4% of the variance in the family effect, 0% in the non-family effect, 15.1% in the peer effect, and 21.7% in the non-peer effect. Satisfaction variance was 55.1% in the family effect, 32.5% in the non-family effect, 54.3% in the peer effect, and 29.9% in the non-peer effect. Repurchase intention variance was 55.9% in the family effect, 63% in the non-family effect, 56.1% in the peer effect, and 65.3% in the non-peer effect. Study 2 Correspondence analysis Correspondence analysis (CA) is a multivariate method used to represent a set of objects in a multidimensional space by identifying relationships among nominal data through consumers’ similarities and preferences (Hair et al. 2014a ). Unlike principal component analysis, it examines the forms of relationships between variables, making the positioning map vital (Galiano-Coronil et al. 2023 ). This study examined family and peer effects in the primary reference group based on different demographic variables. This analysis identified differences between the reference groups through multi-group analysis, learned how they aligned with the sector, demographic structures, and psychographic variables, and offered deep insights. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) includes peer/friend effect, family effect, gender, income, product origin, brand sector, perceived product importance, and age. The MCA results reveal that consumers with low brand identity, brand-lifestyle congruence, and repurchase intention were mainly in the logistics sector. Consumers with medium levels were middle-aged, have medium incomes, prefer the clothing sector, and are price-oriented. High brand identity and repurchase intention are linked to brand-oriented consumers in the alcohol, technology, and food sectors. Younger, low-income women generally prefer clothing, are price-oriented, and are more open to family and peer influence. Men value product origin and brands while being less influenced by family. Figure 4 indicates that high-income and older consumers less influenced by peers are found mainly in the energy, automotive, and luxury products sectors.

Full size image Discussion This study confirms the substantial positive impact of brand identity on brand-lifestyle congruence (β = 0.373, p = 0.001), brand satisfaction (β = 0.472, p = 0.001), and repurchase intention (β = 0.362, p = 0.001). These findings are consistent with existing literature suggesting that consumers often transfer their personality traits and symbolic features of their reference groups to brands (Da Silveira et al. 2013b ). This behavior affects their identity and purchase behaviors. Haanpää ( 2007 ) stated that consumption lifestyle creation are a means of shaping personal identity. As a result, brand identity may affect brand lifestyle congruence. A strong brand identity contributes to brand satisfaction (Alnawas and Altarifi, 2015 ; Coelho et al. 2018 ; He et al. 2012 ; Stokburger-Sauer et al. 2012 ). The literature also revealed that brand identity significantly affects brand identification and brand satisfaction (He et al. 2012 ; Shirazi et al. 2013 ). Brand-lifestyle congruence positively affected both brand satisfaction (β = 0.389, p = 0.001) and repurchase intention (β = 0.176, p = 0.001). However, Çifci et al. ( 2016 ) found no significant effect between brand-lifestyle congruence and brand satisfaction, differing from this study. However, Suyanto et al. ( 2019 ) reported that lifestyle congruence impacts product preferences and that social class lifestyles are effective in influencing product preferences, and that social class lifestyles shape these preferences as consumers assimilate into global culture. Cătălin and Andreea ( 2014 ) found that consumer compliance with brands was analyzed through brand identity and lifestyle. They concluded that consumers tend to trust brands that express their identity and tend to prefer brands that present a unique brand image regarding their lifestyle. Brand satisfaction positively and significantly impacted repurchase intention (β = 0.351, p = 0.001). These findings were consistent with studies by Alnawas and Aburub ( 2016 ), Carlson et al. ( 2019 ), Park et al. ( 2019 ), and Li and Fang ( 2019 ). The family effect moderates the entire model, and introduces significant differences within the structural framework. The relations between variables differ according to specific local pathways. For consumers influenced by their family’s previous brand choices, brand identity significantly affects brand-lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and repurchase intention. However, brand identity only affects satisfaction for consumers without this familial influence. As a result, if consumers are used to products through family useage and lifestyles, they are likely to continue purchasing them. In this context, we argue that long-term memory appears to be more effective than peer influence, particularly in cases involving family impact. Brand-lifestyle congruence affects both brand satisfaction and repurchase intention regarding the family effect. However, without this influence, only the relationship between brand-lifestyle congruence and brand satisfaction remains significant and positive. Ozdemir et al. ( 2020 ) stated that consumer experiences with brands are social and influenced by peers. Da Silva et al. ( 2016 ) stated that lifestyle is formed from past experiences and personal characteristics, which affects the consumption habits within families. Thus, lifestyle influenced by familial factors will affect family members’ perceptions of brands. Chen ( 2018 ) also stated that families and reference groups could affect consumer lifestyles. While these findings are consistent with the literature, they differ from the results of Çifci et al. ( 2016 ). The effect of satisfaction on repurchase intention is significant both with and without the family effect, but the regression coefficient is higher without it. So, consumer behavior influenced by family turns into repurchasing through lifestyle, while consumer behavior without family influence is driven more by satisfaction. Therefore, brands should emphasize active family usage and carry out awareness and promotional activities to reinforce this behavior. If not possible, maximizing brand satisfaction remains crucial. Regarding peers or friends, no moderating effect was detected across the whole model However, the peer effect did show a moderating effect in local pathways. Brand identity positively affected brand lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and repurchase intention when considering the peer effect. However, this relationship was only significant between brand identity and brand lifestyle congruence without peer effect. Brand-lifestyle congruence significantly and positively impacted brand satisfaction and repurchase intention regardless of peer effect. Still, the relationship between brand lifestyle congruence and brand satisfaction was stronger without the peer effect and showed a significant moderator effect. While these findings differ from Çifci et al. ( 2016 ), they are consistent with Zhang ( 2010 ), as the peer effect significantly impacted brand satisfaction and repurchase intention. This study is consistent with existing literature. Chernev et al. ( 2011 ) also stated that individuals use brands according to the social groups they want to enter or leave. This finding supports the literature. Brand reinforcement and repitition occurred less frequently with peer influence than with family influence, since social and professional circles often change. However, when social circles shift, peer influence has a shorter-lasting effect compared to family, since repetition and reinforcement of the brands are less consistent. For individuals influenced by their peers (those who choose brands used by their peers), the link between brand-lifestyle congruence and repurchase intention is weaker than for those who are not influenced by their peers. Thus, those easily influenced by their friends are more likely to change their lifestyle or preferred brand. Conversely, individuals less influenced by their circle of friends develop stronger bonds with brands that fit their lifestyle. Gomez and Spielmann ( 2019 ) reported that the reference group effect depends on how closely individuals identify with the group, and brands associated with the in-group will associate more strongly with the self than out-group brands. Wei and Yu ( 2012 ) also found that exposure to the reference group effect varies by age, gender, ethnicity, and social relationships, with Hispanic consumers showing differing perceptions based on ethnic identification. The findings indicate that individuals form weaker identification bonds with brands under peer effect but develop stronger bonds with brands within the family context. Wei and Yu ( 2012 ) stated that the family effect is stronger than the peer effect in Thailand compared to the United States. In Türkiye, a different cultural region, the variance rate explained by lifestyle regarding the family effect was 22.4%, while the peer effect accounted for 15.1%, indicating a 7.3% difference. Therefore, family has more influence than peers regarding lifestyle. However, this situation does not significantly differ in brand satisfaction and repurchase intention because the differences ranged from 0.2% to 0.9%. In contrast, individuals not affected by the family effect cared about product brands, had a high brand perception, and concentrated on the fast-moving consumer goods, technology, and sports products sectors. Studies indicate that peer effects are particularly influential in high-income and elderly groups, especially in sectors like automotive, energy, and luxury products. Consumers swayed by both family and peers tend to be price-sensitive and are primarily women. They focus on fast-moving consumer goods, electronics, and sports products, emphasize product origin, and act in a price-oriented manner. Makgosa and Mohube ( 2007 ) noted that peer influence varies significantly across product categories, affecting both normative and informational influences, especially in luxury goods compared to necessities. The absence of the family effect seems to heighten consumer sensitivity to brand image, particularly in fast-moving consumer goods, technology, and sports products. This shift suggests more personal or lifestyle-driven purchasing behaviors when family influence is minimal (Bearden and Etzel, 1982 ). Greco ( 2015 ) emphasized that family and peer influences distinctively mold consumer preferences across product lines, reflecting how social dynamics shape purchasing habits. Kovitcharoenkul and Anantachart ( 2018 ) also highlighted the nuanced interplay of social influences on consumer behavior in a more multifaceted manner compared to individual family or peer effects. These findings reveal the complexity of consumer decisions, showing how social influences shape behavior across demographics. They help identify segments and their vulnerabilities to social influences, guiding targeted marketing strategies. In summary, this analysis enriches existing knowledge by detailing how peer and family effects distinctly and collectively influence consumer choices across different sectors and demographics. This comprehensive view of consumer behavior dynamics illustrates how social influences distinctly or jointly shape behavior and offers insight into specific consumer segment susceptibilities—informing targeted marketing strategies. Conclusion The brand identity was vital regarding consumer brand-lifestyle congruence, brand satisfaction, and repurchase intentions. Brand-lifestyle congruence affected brand satisfaction and repurchase intention, while brand satisfaction itself significantly affected repurchase intention. Family and peer effects also shape consumer behavior. The family effect moderated the whole model, whereas the peer effect was effective only in local pathways. The family effect was essential for aligning the brand with consumer lifestyles, and both family and peer effects were critical for brand satisfaction and repurchase intention. In the absence of family or peer influence, brands still reflected consumers’ lifestyles, and high brand satisfaction led to strong repurchase intentions. Finally, high-income and elderly consumers were susceptible to peer and family influence, while consumers influenced by family tended to be middle-aged, low-income men. Soininen and Merisuo-Storm ( 2010 ) said that peers or friends played an essential role for young people, consistent with the MCA analysis findings. Older individuals were less affected by peers, while middle-aged and younger individuals were more aligned with clusters influenced by peers and family. These consumers prioritized brand and product origin when making purchases. In terms of both family and peer influence, women were more affected, less concerned with product origin, and more price-oriented. Thus, women were more open to family and peer effects than men. Theoretical contribution This study highlighted a significant relationship between brand identity and brand lifestyle. It marked an important theoretical contribution to the literature. It also revealed the impactful role of reference groups (family and peer/friend) in this relationship. According to social identity theory, the fit between brand lifestyle and consumer identity serves as an important moderator in consumer–brand identification. Additionally, this research noted that family influence tends to have a stronger impact on the sense of belonging than peer influence. This insight supports the notion from socialization theory that consumers develop consumption-related attitudes and behaviors through interaction with social agents. Wang et al. ( 2012 ) discussed peers as significant agents of socialization, particularly in how they shape brand preferences through communication. However, their analysis did not deeply explore family influence in brand selection. This study fills that gap by providing empirical evidence that family influence more profoundly shapes consumer–brand identification than peer influence. This insight further enhances our understanding of the roles different socialization agents play in enhancing brand loyalty and engagement. This research extends self-congruity theory by linking brand identity with lifestyle congruity and examining their collective impact on brand satisfaction and repurchase intentions. This composite model illustrates how different reference groups can moderate these relationships, which leads to different consumer behaviors. This complexity provides a comprehensive framework for understanding consumer–brand relationships, which only enriches understanding of the theory. Relationship marketing theory states that strong brand relationships reduce inter-brand switching. This study reinforces this by showing that family influence strengthens consumer–brand relationships more than peer influence, which enhances trust and reduces the likelihood of switching brands. Petina et al. ( 2013 ) emphasized trust as a cornerstone of relationship marketing, but the literature has not fully explored how reference groups influence trust dynamics within brand relationships. This study addressed this oversight and demonstrated that family groups tend to generate deeper trust and stronger brand relationships. This insight shows marketers the importance of designing brand strategies that cultivate trust in targeted groups to enhance effectiveness and loyalty. Cultural branding theory states that brands derive power from consumers’ efforts to communicate their identities through brand choices (Smith and Speed, 2011 ). Previous studies often failed to address how different reference groups—specifically family and peers—affect branding efforts. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that these groups distinctly influence consumer–brand relationships. The findings suggest that brand strategies must account for prevailing reference group dynamics to effectively negotiate brand identity within these social contexts. This insight enhances our understanding of cultural branding by emphasizing the need to adapt branding strategies to specific social influences impacting consumer behavior. In summary, the findings of this study support relationship marketing and cultural branding theories by showing that strong, trust-based relationships, influenced by family dynamics, lead to reduced inter-brand switching. Additionally, the effectiveness of reference groups in shaping brand identity and consumer behavior offers new insights into how leveraging cultural elements to strengthen consumer connections. Managerial implication This study provides essential insights for managers and marketers seeking to optimize their strategies around brand identity, lifestyle congruence, and their influence on brand satisfaction and repurchase intention. A strong brand identity that resonates with the lifestyles of consumers not only enhances brand satisfaction and repurchase intentions but also positions the brand competitively in the market. Investing strategically in brand identity helps resonate with and shape target demographics’ lifestyles, as exemplified by Apple’s success. Brands with clear identities are better equipped to dominate their market sectors. Family and peer groups significantly shape consumer behavior. Family ties, in particular, profoundly impact brand satisfaction and lifestyle congruence. Brands should leverage these insights through promotional messages that tap into nostalgic connections, especially for consumers with strong family ties. Family-oriented marketing strategies can embed the brand into consumers’ lifestyles and create long-term loyalty, with customers more likely to repurchase the products. Different strategies may be required for consumers influenced primarily by peers versus family. Peer-influenced lifestyle changes are less stable, so businesses should invest in branding that targets permanent and widely appealing lifestyles to ensure long-term profitability. For consumers heavily influenced by family, nostalgia-based marketing can be particularly effective. Businesses should focus on increasing brand quality perception and satisfaction, especially for consumers not strongly influenced by family or peers. Effective communication and brand awareness campaigns are essential to improve the brand’s position in consumers’ minds. By understanding and addressing these consumers specific needs and preferences, companies can achieve higher brand satisfaction and loyalty. Marketing strategies should also consider gender differences in response to peer and family influence. For women, price-sensitive strategies that maintain quality capture significant market share, particularly in clothing and media. For men, emphasizing brand origin and offering high-quality items can be more effective due to stronger peer influence. Monitoring social media channels for real-time feedback and addressing negative perceptions is crucial to maintain consumer trust and loyalty. Businesses should incorporate these insights into their long-term strategies. Building a brand identity that aligns with evolving lifestyles and effectively using reference group dynamics will help companies stay competitive and achieve sustained success. Future research and limitation The first limitation was in sample collection; since the data were not collected randomly, the study cannot be generalized. Therefore, similar studies should use random sampling methods to increase the validity of the findings. The second limitation was the study’s focus on a specific geographic region and a collectivist culture. Similar research conducted in different geographies, cultures (individualist or collectivist), or comparative analyses of different cultures would improve the research’s validity. The third limitation was the use of a limited number of psychographic variables. The human factor is crucial in the social sciences and is often influenced by many variables simultaneously. Lastly, the study focused solely on primary reference groups. Future research should include secondary reference groups and compare their effects with primary groups to add valuable insights to the literature.
