  "data": "Mr.Pranjal Chalise is a 19-year-old Enthusiastic Technopreneur & an Independent Researcher from Kathmandu. He has been awarded with the title of “Wai Wai Glocal Teen Hero 2021” at the seventh iteration of the Glocal Teen Hero Award, organized by Glocal Pvt. Ltd. Since childhood, he has been enthralled by the idea of Computer Science. He has a passion for science & technology. He is exceptional and infectious in his approach to come out with ideas to solve societal problems. Pranjal says, “Technology is my language. It is my course of action that provides me with the platform to articulate rational solutions I craft. It is the medium through which I direct my passion and skillset to carve tangible impact in the world I live in.” He has created Drishti Nepal, Kishan Nepal, Surakshya Nepal, and Educational Applications through the medium of technology that has been able to aid the adversities of disadvantaged groups and brought them to a common frontier. So, the Technopreneur sector for him is something that flows candidly. It is his passion, and he follows his passion. Mr. Chalise is generating ripple effects in the lives of students, farmers, organizations, differently-abled individuals, women, and gender equality by developing mobile applications. Pranjal has contributed to the Blind Community by developing Drishti Nepal (an open-source cross-platform mobile application.) There are about 95,000 visually impaired individuals in Nepal (2011 census). This figure has escalated over the years, which truly validates a need for some kind of solution to the daily challenges visually impaired people face due to their impediment. One such prominent area is their inability to participate in the economy through financial transactions. So, to assist visually impaired individuals to recognize various currency bills and execute daily cash transactions efficiently reducing skepticism, his team came up with the idea of “Drishti Nepal.” Today, he is leading as the Lead App Developer. Similarly, he has created ‘ Kisan Nepal’ . He recognized that farmers in Nepal lacked the privilege of acquiring relevant news efficiently and effectively. After interviewing some farmer representatives, he found the farmers do not have a medium to fetch agricultural news and notices. Therefore, Kisan Nepal app is designed for farmers in Nepal, which focuses on bringing all the relevant information around the agricultural sector and presents them in one place. His another venture, ‘Surakshya Nepal’ – a Women Safety App, which sends SOS alert messages to the listed contacts that the user selects during the time of a safety emergency. Through this mobile application, he intends to ensure the safety of women under the risk of compromisation because of some morally unethical perspectives. This mobile application is featured to work in absence of Wi-Fi as well, which ensures the unavailability of Wi-Fi does not affect women’s security. During the pandemic, seeing when students were suffering because of the abrupt transition of the learning system from physical classes to online, he established ‘e-educators Nepal’ to enhance the quality of online education and ease the accessibility of educational resources. His tech venture is helping students to improve their academic performance and nurturing their self-learning processes. It was built in order to enhance academic performances that were hindered by the pandemic, through the dissemination of various course notes and academic resources to students, reducing the gaps in education, and fostering their self-learning processes under their fingertips. Apart from that, he is currently conveying the role of President at Computer Science Initiatives in Nepal, and Research Mentor at Students Research Council Nepal (SRCN) . He has been working as a Co-mentor of a tech-project to uplift the travel experience of tourists and at the same time support local businesses of Nepal, at Incubate Nepal. He is recognized as one of the brightest high school students (One of 20 selected students from all disciplines and one of 10 for Computer Science) from all over Nepal to work on open-end research projects under the mentorship of MIT and Harvard graduates. Currently, He is also working on a research paper on the topic “Blockchain Technology, Smart Contracts and its application in Nepal’s securities.” Future Plans! In the future, he hopes to leverage his knowledge and capacity to do whatever he can to help the world become a better place. Furthermore, he hopes to fully utilize the opportunities that he gets and be able to influence change more easily. Also, in the coming days, he is looking forward to taking his previous projects to a greater height through collaboration with his connections at GTH. Message to teenagers! Many things are possible as long as you don’t know they are impossible. “Age is Just a Number”, generally teenagers of our age step back from doing something great because they have this misconception of the age barrier. This is totally wrong; everything is possible if you have that will and determination. To get started all we need is a ray of hope and some serious motivation, and this serious motivation hits the hardest when it comes from someone of your own age because we human beings have this tendency of envying people, “If he can, why can’t I?”. Glocal Teen Hero is a platform for teenagers to identify and honor outstanding teenagers whose creativity, commitment, experience, and strong leadership have helped them achieve success in an increasingly challenging environment. This award recognizes and honors the exceptional teen whose work is sustainable and who can think out of the box addressing the issues and creating an impact in society. Fostering a collaborative community among recipients and strengthening the national recognition of today’s young leaders is a primary goal of the Glocal Teen Hero Award.
