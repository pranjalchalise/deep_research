I Understand Faculty & Student Research Home Departments Chemistry/Biochemistry Chemistry Department Research Skip to main content Faculty and Student Research Many students will present the results of their research at national, regional, and local meetings. Especially for the national meetings, proposals for research presentation must be submitted and the approved for inclusion in the meeting. Fast Facts: 27 Undergraduate Coauthors Departmental faculty members have published 21 peer-reviewed articles with a total of 27 undergraduate coauthors since 2008. >1/3 Students Engaged in Research Greater than 1/3 of all departmental majors are actively engaged in research during each academic year. 7 Students in Summer Research An average of 7 students per summer participate with a faculty mentor in our Summer Research Program through which they receive a research stipend, room, and board. Undergraduate research is both the cornerstone and the capstone of the Elizabethtown College Chemistry & Biochemistry curriculum. Students can begin independent research with a faculty mentor as early as their first year and work with one or more faculty mentors during the academic year and summer, leading up to completion of a required research experience during the senior year. In addition, fundamental research questions are routinely incorporated into the teaching laboratories associated with specific courses.

We love to talk about our research, and so do our students! Learn more about the Chemical Hygiene Plan Learn more about the Emergency Spill Response Procedure Dr. Jeffrey Rood's Research Group Research interests lie in two main areas. In coordination chemistry, new alkaline earth and transition metal complexes are synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as potential catalysts for various types of reactions or applied to cellular systems as possible insulin mimetics. Also under development are novel Metal-Organic Frameworks, porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linker molecules that assemble together into extended, three-dimensional structures, and whose pore shape and size are dictated by the identity of the metal and the length of the organic molecules. These materials are of interest for applications such as the storage of small molecules and potential as luminescence-based sensors.

Fluoresc . 2016 , 26, 2271-2280. Dr. James MacKay's Research Group Synthetic organic chemistry is used to construct interesting and relevant target molecules. Much of our work involves heterocyclic chemistry focused on the synthesis of molecules capable of sensing and molecular recognition. Current efforts focus on the design of novel peptide nucleic acid (PNA) monomers that are capable to binding sequence selectively with double stranded RNA. These PNAs will be used in biotechnological applications aimed at understanding more about non-coding RNA. Other projects include synthesis rhodamine derivatives that could be used in mercury sensing applications, a green method for functionalization of pyrazoles, and use of microwaves to accelerate organic transformations.

( DOI : 10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.09.042) Dr. Lauren Toote's Research Group Our broad research goal is to develop diagnostic tools for environmental and medical applications. Currently, we are designing a water quality test that is sensitive, simple and inexpensive. Projects include the synthesis of colorimetric molecular probes for heavy metals, encapsulation of these probes into polymer nanoparticles and the incorporation of these nanoparticles into a lateral flow assay. The culmination of this project will be a paper-based test for the detection of mercury and lead in drinking water samples. Additionally, we are working to develop a fast and specific, magnetic-bead immunoassay for Lyme Disease. These projects give students experience in synthetic, materials, bio and analytical chemistry.
