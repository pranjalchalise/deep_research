We have published more than 60 papers in Science, JACS, PNAS, Nat Commun, Angew Chemie, and other important journals, and has been granted three copyrights for computer software related to the development of algorithms. What You Can Expect in the Project You will have the opportunity to participate in one of the following two research projects: (1) Study of functional molecular self-assembly using molecular simulation techniques. (2) Combining machine learning and quantum chemistry computing to study chemical synthesis pathway design. Apply"
