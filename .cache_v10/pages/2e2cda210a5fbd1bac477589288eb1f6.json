These shared principles underscore our dedication to working together. Public education is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy Free, quality public education must be available to every child and youth regardless of a family's situation. All participants (parents and school personnel) should be full and meaningful partners in the education of children and youth with disabilities.&nbsp; The federal government plays a crucial role in supplementing state funding and in shaping special education policy that ensures equitable access to quality education for students with disabilities. Under federal law, states retain substantial responsibility for the education of children and youth with disabilities. The rights of children and youth with disabilities to a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) is essential to their accessing a meaningful and equitable education and must be maintained and protected through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Federal funding under IDEA should be provided at the 40% per pupil expenditure level originally promised by the U.S. Congress to assure states have the capacity to provide needed services and specially designed instruction to students with disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. Department of Education should remain an independent agency that is fully staffed and funded to oversee federal laws including IDEA and Section 504. ### Council of Administrators of Special Education (CASE) : CASE is a non-profit professional organization of choice for special education administrators and leaders across the country and around the globe. With over 6,000 members,CASE provides leadership to advance the field of special education through professional learning, policy, and advocacy.&nbsp; Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA) :&nbsp;COPAA is where the movement for education equity gains its strength. We unite advocates of all forms to defend the civil rights of children with disabilities and their families. With a 3,700+ strong network of parents, students, advocates, attorneys, and allied professionals, we connect and equip those on the front lines through structured learning, community support, and systemic advocacy. Together, our members work to uphold children’s and family’s rights and create environments where every student is seen, supported, and set up to thrive.&nbsp; &nbsp; National Organizations AACTE: American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education AASA, The School Superintendents Association Access Ready, Inc.
