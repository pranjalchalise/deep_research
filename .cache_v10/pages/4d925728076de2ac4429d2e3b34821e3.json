Dhaneesh Jameson 7 min read · Oct 14, 2022 -- Listen Share T he product design industry has been on a rocket ship since the break of the covid-19 pandemic. Product companies were on a hiring spree and team sizes have tripled if not more. This also marked the entry of many more top leadership levels which was not very common before 2020. “in 2020, she was largely hiring design managers; in 2021, she was searching for design directors; and in 2022, she’s geared up to find the right fit for “VP” and “CDO [chief of design]” positions” — The Ken quoted a design recruiter. ( Read the full article here ) The traditional career progression ladder has a linear direction to the top. Everyone had the same ladder of growth. In an ideal scenario, the traditional model does not suggest skipping a level to move up as there are prerequisites for each level from the previous one. The first two levels (Technical and Operational) give everyone the foundation for different kinds of competencies and enough time to self-evaluate. Typically, the 3rd level (Tactical) is an ideal time to start focusing on a track-specific route as it is beginning to get into strategic decision-making layers.

There are different points of view about having these hierarchical setups. Especially with the promoters of flat hierarchy models and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) getting popular among the new generation companies. However, I am in favour of hierarchical models as of now over flat models with no hierarchy. One of the undeniable factors here is the dimension of time(experience over e period) which is inimitable. Hierarchy doesn't mean it is a rigid top-down only model, hence it must not be confused with the work culture and best practices. These levels are only used when career growth can be measured and improved. It also helps a great deal in project planning where final outcome is influenced by the wisdom of people at different levels. You do not allow your heart to be operated on by a medical student or a non-cardiac specialised physician no matter what their confidence level is and the same goes with pilots. I understand not all design interventions deal with threatening situations but having specialisations and levels are signs of growth for any domain. However, given the golden opportunities in the product design function in recent years, many designers started chasing trendier titles or higher levels that are not matched with the present competencies. It is true certain titles gave more options in the job market and higher pay. It is true that it may have worked for some, but not for most. For those who have gaps in their competencies (mismatch with the right track or the right design sensibilities) and maturity (higher career progression level when not ready) can become a frustrating experience leading to anxiety issues, leading them to the rabbit hole of imposter syndrome, killing their own careers at a young stage of their professional journey. It is a game of challenge vs. skill. Press enter or click to view image in full size Based on the book ‘Flow’ by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi The point is- each of these levels has its importance in the journey, getting seasoned at each level with its own unique and focused challenges prepares everyone to take up the next levels with higher confidence. One needs to identify the optimal experience to build a long-lasting career than prioritising short-term wins. I am of an opinion that one should keep pushing the boundaries above the comfort zone, as long as it does not lead to serious constant burn-outs. We grow only when we are challenged by the status quo. So moving out of the levels at the right time is equally important as moving into the upper levels at the right time. Hence, this brings in the importance of sub-levels (transitioning levels) between the milestone levels. The sub-levels of progression. Having sub-levels has advantages for the employees and the employer. Each of the 5 macro segments is further divided into a minimum of 3 parts. For the employees, it gives them a sense of progression and helps in setting in-between milestones. For employers, it gives them enough distinction between employees within the same band, yet different in their experiences. Press enter or click to view image in full size Sub-levels help in easing in and easing out of major milestone levels First of all, there is no accurate science behind defying these levels. So a pre-level (Associate) is when a person is not yet mature to be playing the role in full capacity but has clearly graduated from the previous. Being in this new band should feel like you are lifting a little bit of extra load. The post-level(Senior) is when someone has quite aced the current band and its expectations, and maybe explore the next level of duties at a skip level in the comfort of the current until they gather full confidence to move up. The in-between one(key/ milestone level) is the typical median, where one finds the perfect balance of comfort and challenge. Depending on the team size, budget for hiring talent and other priorities different organisations have different standards for adding more positions within the same hierarchy. At the VP level, some organisations have Associates and Assistants. Assistants are at a higher rank than Associates and Assistants would be directly collaborating with a VP with shared responsibilities at the same level as the VP. This position can be also used when someone wants to not take up active managerial or leadership roles, but to be available for assistance if the leader (from the same level) needs any help. On that note, there is no relevance to having an Assistant role, if there is no one to assist. I have lightly touched up on the kind of macro expectations for each level and its sublevel groups. It is often tempting to get hands-on with your previous level but rather it is better you trust your people in their job and focus on your own responsibilities.

After Level E (Top line leadership), it is the executive leadership level, which I have not covered in this post (I would love to come back and update it when I have enough clarity on them). Ideally, the next level on such a hierarchy is about ‘transcendence’, but that may be too idealistic than practical if we do not consider people at that level as true partners in the business with complete autonomy of power. Considering it is like the last band of leadership and it should not have a low ceiling anyway but should be a north star forever. But until I have better clarity I would put the executive level under the macro segment of ‘vision’.

There is no strict logic that says all must go through each and every transitioning layer. The names of each level are given to uniquely identify the separate tracks. It doesn’t matter what an organisation calls its leadership levels, as long as each level has clear and unique responsibilities and expectations it helps in transitioning between jobs. It is ultimately a function of the understanding between the employee and the employer. This traditional model is not weathering out yet. But there are a lot of new-generation startups experimenting with different models of governance with and without a visible hierarchy. Popularized through cryptocurrency and blockchain technology there are new emerging models like decentralized autonomous organization(DAO) , It presents contrasting fresh approaches to decision-making and management with no central governing body. The members in such models share a common goal to act in the best interest of the larger vision, against the traditional model presented here where each level has dedicated goals and responsibilities. I do not have enough knowledge to further expand on DAOs yet. So will come back to this later.
