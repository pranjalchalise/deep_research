The curriculum prepares Centre graduates for lives of meaningful work and sustained curiosity. By the time you graduate, you will have taken a set of courses unique to you that will empower you to engage with, to continue to learn from, and to contribute to your chosen communities—and the world beyond them. Centre’s faculty designed the General Education Curriculum to complement, not compete with, your major. Only three general education courses (two first-year seminars and a collaborative interdisciplinary capstone) will take place at specific moments during your academic journey. With guidance from your advisor, you will decide how and when to pursue the other course requirements, though students commonly complete four General education requirements in their first year and approximately two in each subsequent year. You may find that several general education requirements can be fulfilled as part of your major. In your two first-year seminar courses you will meet other first-year students, embrace your new role in the Centre College community, and build on your existing skills in writing and in oral communication. You will also likely take courses in a second language and in math during your first two years. You will explore the three main academic divisions of the College: Arts and Humanities, Social Studies, and Science and Mathematics, selecting courses that interest you from a wide variety of options. The Centre curriculum will also challenge you to experience new aspects of the world, focusing on concrete applications of your academic pursuits through areas such as Arts Engagement, Global Engagement, Community-Based Learning, Mentored Research, or Internships. You will join others in analyzing sustainability and difference and equity, two pressing areas of social responsibility. Lastly, as a capstone, you will complete an interdisciplinary seminar during your junior or senior year. This seminar will push you to draw upon your major and General Education experiences to think critically and creatively about complex issues in the world today while working as part of a team. Again, you may fulfill many of your general education requirements as you complete the requirements for your major or minor, and you may often fulfill general education requirements while studying away or abroad. Whenever possible, the curriculum offers you great variety while also providing core courses in critical skills such as communication, creative thinking, and problem solving. Centre College’s motto is doctrina lux mentis, Latin for “learning is the light of the mind.” We continue to use this motto to remind us of our collective mission. As a Centre College student, you will join a community of scholars who value learning as an endeavor that not only illuminates the mind but also shines the light of understanding on the world and all those within it. This motto gives its name to three of the core experiences in Centre’s General Education Curriculum: Doctrina Lux Mentis (DLM) I, II, and III. The first two DLM courses (110 and 120, called \"The Craft of Writing\" and \"The Art of Speaking\" respectively) are skill-enhancing seminar courses taken in your first year, one in the fall and one in the spring, whereas DLM III (called \"Interdisciplinary Collaboration\") serves as the capstone experience in your junior or senior year. DLM Courses I (110) and II (120) DLM I and II courses are small-group learning environments that engage first-year students in intensive educational experiences to develop intellectual skills—to read critically, think logically, and communicate effectively. DLM I (\"The Craft of Writing\") emphasizes writing skills, while DLM II (\"The Art of Speaking\") emphasizes oral communication skills. Both courses include attention to imagination, creativity, reasoning, problem-solving, integration of ideas, and judgment—all skills essential to critical thinking and academic success. Your DLM professors will come from across the campus and will develop courses focused on innovative topics. Your professors will help you understand your own processes of learning and communicating better, whether that means helping you through multiple drafts of a paper, encouraging written reflection, mentoring you in leading a group discussion, or workshopping a formal presentation with you. DLM courses may not count toward any major or minor. Second Language Courses You live in an interdependent, globalized world. The ability to understand and communicate in multiple languages serves as a key to help you understand the basic modes of thought, life, and expression of other cultures. Knowledge of other cultures will contribute in essential ways to your responsible engagement in this world. In your second language courses you will develop cross-cultural and linguistic skills that will aid you later in life. If you place above the introductory level in second language on our placement test, you will take at least one additional college-level language course conducted in that language. If you do not yet have introductory second language skills—or you would prefer to start learning a new language—you must take at least the two-course introductory sequence in that language. You can enroll in courses in the following languages at Centre (in alphabetical order): French, German, ancient Greek, Japanese, Latin, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish. If you are an international student (a permanent resident of a country other than the United States) and English is not a native language, you may automatically fulfill your second language requirement if your high school education was not primarily conducted in English. Please contact the Registrar for more information. You are certainly welcome to study an additional language during your time at Centre. Mathematics Mathematics is a universal language, a creative practice, and a way of interpreting the world around us; it empowers deeper understanding of many disciplines, problems, and endeavors. Therefore, all Centre students will take a mathematics course. Your course placement will be determined by the results of a placement test. Writing Student performance in writing will be evaluated at the end of the first long term of enrollment. At that time, students whose writing is judged to be competent will have satisfied the writing requirement. Students whose writing is judged to fall short of competency will be required to submit a satisfactory three-page portfolio to the Committee on Student Writing by the end of the spring term of the first year or earn a grade of C- or higher in ENG 170 (Topics in Writing) by the end of the sophomore year. Exploration (E) In your coursework you will explore many different disciplines, inspiring a lifetime of broad learning and curiosity about the world. You will work closely with your faculty advisor to select a wide range of courses, especially in your first and second years, because many students uncover unexpected interests and even new career directions in these first semesters. The Exploration requirement has very few restrictions, provided that you complete six courses from six different disciplines: two each from each of the three divisions, Arts & Humanities (Division 1), Social Studies (Division 2), and Science & Mathematics (Division 3). Courses that satisfy this requirement are tagged “E1”, \"E2\", and \"E3\" in the schedule of classes. In Exploration courses you will build a broad foundation of knowledge that explores the expression of human experience, the multiplicity of human worldviews, and the natural world. In doing so, you will enhance your ability to think interdisciplinary and creatively within multiple contexts, including your major. In the spirit of intellectual freedom, Centre’s Exploration courses allow students to tailor their general education experience towards fields that match their own needs and interests. Arts & Humanities (two courses in two different disciplines): In exploring the Arts & Humanities you will engage with works of creative and intellectual expression. The Arts and Humanities provide methods for exploring the varied expression of human experience and the means of participating in that expression. Through the use of diverse forms of communication, exposure to multiple perspectives, and engagement of the imagination, you will develop the capacity for creativity, risk-taking, problem-solving, personal insight, and empathy. Such disciplines include African and African American Studies, Art History, Asian Studies, Chinese, Classics, English, Film Studies, French, German, Linguistics, Music, Philosophy, Studio Art, and Theater. Note: second language courses in Chinese, French, and German do not count as Exploration courses. Social Studies (two courses in two different disciplines): In Social Studies courses you will engage actively and empathetically with significant social issues from various points of view. The study of different cultures and communities— contemporary, historical, or prehistorical—develops your capacity to understand the points of view, sentiments, and intentions of others. Through the exploration and study of multiple peoples and perspectives, you will learn to appreciate the multiplicity of human worldviews, to explore your own identity, to identify and challenge injustice and inequality. Such disciplines include Anthropology, Economics, Education, Environmental Studies, Gender Studies, History, International Studies, Politics, Religion, and Sociology. Note: Environmental Studies spans two divisions, Social Studies and Sciences & Mathematics. Be careful to note how each course is tagged. Sciences & Mathematics (two courses in two different disciplines, including at least one laboratory course): In your Science & Mathematics exploration courses, you will learn about the natural world and explore the universe through observation, modeling, experimentation, programming, and data analysis as you build your analytical and problem-solving skills. In addition to the required mathematics course, students may further deepen their mathematical knowledge and skills through mathematics exploration courses. Such disciplines include Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Data Science, Environmental Studies, Mathematics, Natural Science, Physics, and Psychology. Note: only select Mathematics courses count as Exploration courses. Exploration courses may count toward majors and minors, but they may also be elective courses. Except for a few courses requiring basic math competency, these courses have no prerequisites. Students may receive credit for both an “Exploration” requirement and either the Difference and Equity or the Sustainability “Connection” requirement for an individual course (see below). Connection Courses The value of a Centre education is not simply in building intellectual breadth and academic skills; rather, its value manifests itself through the responsible application of your education to benefit society, which in turn brings purpose, meaning, and fulfillment to your life. Through Connection courses, students practice applying their knowledge and skills in meaningful and practical ways, addressing complex societal problems and grappling with important questions such as: How will I serve my community? How can my leadership remove systemic barriers to equity and inclusion? How can I protect the sustainability of the planet, its organisms, and its people? You will take four courses explicitly designed to connect theory with practice; at least two of these courses will be explicitly experiential, and two will engage directly with the topics of human difference and equity and environmental sustainability. Experiential Learning Experiential Learning courses in this Connection category will actively engage you with people, materials, and ideas necessary for practical work, exploration, or creation. Centre College offers many Experiential Learning opportunities to help you apply and extend your knowledge and skills through academically rigorous, hands-on learning activities. You will complete at least two courses (for a total of at least 4 credits) from two of the following five areas: Arts Engagement, Global Engagement, Community-Based Learning, Mentored Research, and Internships, as described below. Arts Engagement (A) courses engage you in applying principles, refining skills, and mastering techniques through arts projects in areas like Creative Writing, Music, Studio Art, and Theatre. These courses hone your self-awareness, tap into your creativity, and develop your appreciation of artistic processes, risk-taking, and empathy. Courses that satisfy this requirement are tagged “A” in the schedule of classes. Community-Based Learning (C) courses include field-based learning experiences where students and community partners support and learn from one another. These courses create unique opportunities for you to participate in, learn about, and serve communities beyond campus. Courses that satisfy this requirement are tagged “C” in the schedule of classes. Global Engagement (G) courses help you to explore cultures, life experiences, and worldviews different from your own. In these courses you will explore the world as an interrelated system. You may earn credit for this category by participating in study abroad courses. Courses that satisfy this requirement are tagged “G” in the schedule of classes. Internships allow you to connect skills and knowledge from the classroom with career exploration. Academic credit internships (listed as INT 400 in the course catalogue) provide two levels of supervision: by a Centre faculty member and by an on-site supervisor. To successfully earn your credits, you must complete a substantive academic component (determined with your faculty supervisor) and conduct yourself with professionalism throughout your internship. Internships are available after you have completed your first year at Centre. An internship abroad may count towards the Internship portion of Experiential Learning or the Global Engagement (G) tag. Please consult the Center for Career and Professional Development for more information. Mentored Research allows you to construct new knowledge in your disciplinary field of interest. Guided by a mentor, you will apply and test the theories and procedures common to your discipline, providing new insight as you gather evidence about an unanswered question, contested issue, or under-recognized thought leader in your field. Such work may inspire you to become a research scholar as a career goal, but at minimum it will provide keen insight into the ethical conduct of research and a researcher’s responsibility to reflect on their own biases, and that of other researchers, as they interpret evidence and formulate their own conclusions. Courses that satisfy this requirement are tagged \"R\" in the schedule of classes. All disciplines at Centre may offer a course numbered 402, “Research Participation,” which counts toward this requirement. Difference & Equity (D) Difference & Equity general education courses will help prepare you for effective and empathetic leadership and service in diverse communities within and beyond Centre. In your Difference and & Equity course you will critique forms of systemic oppression and marginalization based on difference, identify how these structures enable and constrain agency and inform visions of equity and justice, engage with diverse lived experiences, and examine the ways in which your place in the social world relates to systems of power. Identity differences span a network of factors (listed alphabetically), including age, citizenship status, class, disability, ethnicity, faith background, gender expression, gender identity, geographic region, national origin, neurodiversity, race, and sexual orientation. This requirement ensures that every student will take at least one course that focuses explicitly on the structural challenges and opportunities faced by particular individuals and groups and on visions for a more just and equitable world. Courses that satisfy this requirement are tagged “D” in the schedule of classes. Sustainability (S) Sustainability is a core value of Centre College. Your sustainability course will help you and your peers envision local and global environmental solutions for the 21st century and beyond. You will be introduced to thinking about environmental sustainability in ways that highlight the interdependence of social, economic, and ecological relationships in our communities. A course focused on environmental sustainability will examine how individuals, communities, and global societies can meet human needs without compromising the interconnected environmental systems upon which future generations depend. Courses that satisfy this requirement are tagged “S” in the schedule of classes. All Connection courses (Experiential, Difference and Equity, and Sustainability) may count towards majors or minors except academic credit internships (listed as INT 400 in the course catalog). While a single course may not fulfill both the Exploration and Experiential requirements, a single course may meet an Exploration requirement and either the Difference and Equity requirement or the Sustainability requirement. Students may receive credit for both an “Exploration” requirement and either the Difference and Equity or the Sustainability “Connection” requirement for an individual course. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: DLM III ( DLM 310 ) This capstone course will challenge you to work with students from different disciplines, as you critically consider complex problems, together. These interdisciplinary, upper-level courses are taken in the junior or senior year. They call upon the application of knowledge and skills developed during your broad exploration of the Centre curriculum, including your major or minor. You will work together as part of a team of student-scholars from across the College in this course, closing your Centre career by returning to Centre’s motto, doctrina lux mentis —learning, the light of the mind. DLM courses may not count toward and major or minor. DLM 310 abroad may carry the Global Engagement (G) tag. General Education Summary In summary, upon completion of these requirements and the attainment of a Bachelor’s degree from Centre College, each graduate of the College will: • Possess the foundational skills necessary for a lifetime of independent learning and work, including clear and effective communication in both writing and speaking, competency in mathematics, and familiarity with second languages. • Possess a broad foundation of knowledge in essential areas of the humanities, social studies, the sciences, and mathematics. • Apply their learning to real-world, practical issues, both inside and outside of the classroom, including issues of differences, equity, and sustainability. • Think critically beyond disciplinary boundaries and solve complex problems while working collaboratively as part of a team.

Organization and Structure of the Academic ProgramâMajors and Minors The College’s instructional program is organized into three academic divisions—humanities, social studies, and science and mathematics—each chaired by a member of the faculty under the general oversight of the Dean of the College. The work of each division is carried out through separate program committees representing the various academic disciplines. Major Program Committees are comprised of faculty members and one or two student members. Major and minor areas of concentration offered within the divisions are as follows*: Humanities (Division I) Majors: art history, studio art, Chinese, classical studies, English, French, German studies, music, philosophy, Spanish, theatre. Minors: art history, studio art, Chinese, classical studies, creative writing, English, film studies, French, German studies, music, philosophy, Spanish, theatre. Social Studies (Division II) Majors: anthropology/sociology, business, economics and finance, history, international studies, politics, religion. Minors: anthropology, education, history, international studies, politics, religion, sociology. Science and Mathematics (Division III) Majors: biochemistry and molecular biology, biology, chemical physics, chemistry, computer science, data science, engineering, engineering studies, mathematics, neuroscience, physics, psychology. Minors: biology, chemistry, computer science, data science, health and medical studies, engineering, mathematics, neuroscience, physics, psychology. Interdisciplinary (cross-divisional) Major: environmental studies. Minors: African and African American studies (I), Asian studies (I), environmental studies (II), gender studies (II), Latin American studies (I), linguistics (I), Middle Eastern studies (II), social justice (II). For administrative purposes, these programs report to the noted division. *One major (no minor) is required for the degree. Students may choose a maximum of two majors and one minor or one major and two minors. Double Majors Students may choose to complete two majors during their four years at Centre. This option allows students to expand their academic credentials and explore sometimes quite different personal interests. Some recent combinations include economics and finance and mathematics, Spanish and international studies, psychology and philosophy. Students who double major have an advisor from each program. Students declaring more than a single major must think carefully about their ability to complete all of their declared major and minor requirements, taking into consideration other plans such as study abroad and/or internships and research. The College does not guarantee that a student can complete more than one major in four years, and exceptions to major and minor requirements cannot be made due to conflicts with requirements in the primary major or due to study abroad. Self-Designed Majors In addition to the standard majors, students may also develop a major of their own design. They develop their personal program of junior-senior major study in conjunction with a faculty committee. The completed self-designed major proposal is then submitted for approval by the Academic Standards Committee. By necessity, self-designed majors must rely, substantially, on the strengths and expertise of our faculty and our course offerings. Recently approved self-designed majors include environmental science, creative entrepreneurship, ethnic studies, and integrated sciences in the human context. More detailed information is available from the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Self-designed minors are not permitted. Calendars and Credit Hours The credit hour is the basic unit of credit and credit hours are equivalent to semester hours. The credit hour provides one important measure by which progress toward the degree is gauged. The assignment of credit hours to coursework is not strictly tied to the number of class hours per week. The College recognizes that subject matter, pedagogical methods, and assessment tools will influence the design of any credit-bearing activity, including the frequency and duration of formally-structured faculty-student interactions. The academic calendar consists of two 13-week terms (fall and spring) and a 3-week term in January (CentreTerm), plus a final exam period at the end of each term. In the fall and spring terms, three credit hour courses typically meet for one hour three days a week or for an hour and a half two days a week. In the January term (CentreTerm), three credit hour courses typically meet for three hours a day four or five days a week. Additionally, the college provides non-compulsory summer courses that vary annually. These offerings can include on-campus courses, experiences abroad, and internships. One credit hour is granted for a minimum of three hours of student academic work per week, on average, for the fall and spring terms. In the CentreTerm, all courses carry three credit hours, and a minimum of 36 hours of student academic work per week on average is expected. Academic work includes formal faculty-student interactions (lectures, seminars, laboratories, supervised field work, tutorials, applied and studio instruction, etc.) as well as out-of-class activities such as student-instructor conferences, homework, research, writing and revision, reading, student collaborative and group work, community engaged experiences, academic internship work, practica, recitals, rehearsals, and reflection on all aspects of the coursework. Courses, including credit-hour assignment, are approved by the faculty through a process that requires review and action by the appropriate academic program as well as the curriculum committee. Study Abroad and Study Away Centre Global’s mission is to prepare Centre students for lives of global leadership, work, and service, and to further internationalize our campus. This mission requires a focus on facilitating rich and meaningful experiences for our students, both on and off campus, to strengthen their intercultural competence. We empower our students to embrace the values of global citizenship, striving to build a more just, inclusive, sustainable, and cooperative world. 84% of our graduating class of 2025 studied off-campus at least once and 34% studied off-campus more than once. Centre students studied abroad in 31 countries on 6 continents in the 2024-2025 academic year. We welcome and encourage students to study abroad during their sophomore, junior, and/or senior year. There is no right or wrong time to study abroad, though certain factors, such as academic requirements and sports schedules, may influence this decision Study abroad-away programs have a limited number of spots available and vary widely in their competitiveness. Students should be aware that applying for a program does not guarantee selection for that program. While Centre guarantees all students will have the opportunity to study abroad, we cannot guarantee that all students can study abroad in their preferred program or semester/term. Being flexible and applying to multiple programs is strongly advised. Centre students can apply to study abroad or away in one of our 20 long semester programs offered in 13 different countries. https://www.centre.edu/academics/curriculum/study-abroad-away/semester-long-study-abroad-and-away-locations Long semester (meaning Fall or Spring term) programs include flagship, language immersion, exchange, or partnership programs. Our three flagship programs in Centre-in-London (England), Centre-in-Mérida (Mexico), and Centre-in-Strasbourg (France) offer students a unique opportunity to be taught by Centre faculty and learn alongside other Centre students while abroad for an entire semester. Students undertaking advanced foreign language studies have access to language immersion programs in French, German, Mandarin, and Spanish. Centre College, The University of the South (Sewanee), and Rhodes College partner to jointly operate three off-campus long semester programs: Study and Intern in New York City (New York, USA), Global Environmental Challenges (Cuenca and Galápagos Islands, Ecuador), and Nelson Mandela University (Gqeberha, South Africa). Students from all three institutions can apply to these programs and faculty directors are chosen from each of the institutions on a rotating basis. Centre also offers domestic study-away long semester programs in Boston and Washington D.C. https://www.centre.edu/study-away-programs . For approved long semester programs students pay tuition, room, and board to Centre as normal (or receive credits in lieu). Institutional and federal/state financial aid are portable for these programs. For more details on paying for long semester study abroad and away, see: https://www.centre.edu/about/offices/centre-global/cost-and-details . CentreTerm and summer courses abroad and away are faculty-led 3-credit courses with a new selection of courses on offer every year. Fees for CentreTerm and summer courses are not included in comprehensive fees and costs vary by course. CentreTerm and summer applications are independently reviewed and ranked by faculty course directors; applicant selection is fully at the discretion of the course director. For important study abroad/away application and payment deadlines, see https://www.centre.edu/about/offices/centre-global/important-dates . Research Opportunities for Students Undergraduate research is an inquiry-based form of active learning that allows a student to practice a discipline rather than simply hearing about it in a classroom. At Centre College, undergraduate research may be an independent project, a collaborative project with a faculty mentor, or a project that occurs at another institution. These projects may be student or faculty initiated. While the majority of research takes place in the summer, academic-year opportunities are common. The College may provide summer housing, stipends, and research materials to students engaged in research. Outside grants are also available. Undergraduate research students are encouraged to present at Centre's annual undergraduate research, internship, and creative endeavors (RICE) symposium. These oral or poster presentations are uploaded and preserved in an institutional repository. Many students also present their work at regional, state, and national conference meetings. The John C. Young Program The John C. Young Scholars Program is a senior honors program, which enables a select group of outstanding senior students to engage in independent study and research in their major field or in an interdisciplinary area. The scholars work closely with a faculty mentor and receive financial support for research and travel. They present their results at a public symposium in late spring. This program was initiated through an Excellence-in-Undergraduate-Education grant from the Knight Foundation. Centre was one of eight leading liberal arts colleges (Carleton, Macalester, and Swarthmore, for example) to receive the first of these awards to encourage increased collaboration between faculty and students on extra-class intellectual activities. Applications for participation are submitted in the spring of one's junior year. Undergraduate and Postgraduate Fellowships A fellowship is an opportunity for growth sponsored by an organization outside of Centre College. Fellowships encompass study, research, leadership, and service activities at the regional, national, and international levels. They can fund postgraduate degrees, help pay part of undergraduate costs at Centre, or send students overseas for the summer. Regardless of the type of fellowship, sponsoring organizations use competitive application processes to choose candidates who best exemplify selection criteria. The Office of Fellowships is the primary on-campus resource for students and alumni wanting to explore and pursue competitive fellowships. The office offers one-on-one advising and informational sessions to help students identify opportunities appropriate for their goals. The office also provides individualized mentoring throughout the application and interview processes. Although the pursuit of fellowships is challenging and results are never guaranteed, the application process is a significant learning opportunity and can help students deepen their understanding of themselves and clarify their goals. In the last five years, Centre students and recent alumni have been awarded fellowships through the following national and international foundations: Boren Scholarship, Christianson Fellowship, Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange for Young Professionals, Cralle Fellowship (5), Critical Language Scholarship (3), DAAD RISE Germany (3), Doris Duke Conservation Scholars (2), Bill Emerson National Hunger Fellowship (2), Erasmus, Mundus, Goldwater Scholarship, Fulbright UK Summer Institute, Fulbright U.S. Student Program (13), Gilman Scholarship (20), Hertog Foundation Fellowship, Humanity in Action (4), JET Program (10), Knight-Hennessy Scholars, John R. Lewis Scholars and Fellows (2), National Institutes of Health Summer Internship Program, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (2), Obama Voyager Scholarship, Peace Corps (3), PPIA Junior Summer Institute (4), Princeton in Asia, Project Horseshoe Farm Community Health Fellowship, Rangel Graduate Fellowship, Rotary Global Grant Scholarship (4), Truman Scholarship, and Schwarzman Scholars. Students interested in fellowships should contact Dr. Robert Schalkoff, director of the Office of Fellowships ( fellowships@centre.edu .) Inquiries are encouraged as early as the first year. Advising The Director of Student Academic Support coordinates academic advising and works closely with students experiencing significant academic issues. All faculty members (plus selected administrators) serve as academic advisors to students. Students have general advisors—usually matched by interests—during their first and second years at Centre. Students declare a major or majors in the spring of the sophomore year and are assigned an academic advisor in the declared major discipline. The Director of Student Academic Support also coordinates efforts with the Director of the Centre Learning Commons to help students who experience academic difficulty, particularly in the first two years at Centre. In addition, the Director of Student Academic Support works closely with the Coordinator of the FYC (Finding Your Centre) Program to link multiple academic support systems for first-year students. All first-time, first-year students take the FYC 001: Finding Your Centre course in the fall of the first year. FYC 001 is a one-credit-hour, graded (A-U) course designed to support students as they navigate the transition from high school to college, and help them develop the knowledge and skills that they need to be successful at Centre. Topics covered in FYC include “learning how to learn” on a college-level, understanding one’s role and responsibility as a member of the Centre community, campus resources and policies, and developing a sense of belonging. Each section of FYC 001 is taught by a faculty or staff instructor with support from an upper-class peer mentor. For questions or additional information, contact the Director of First-year Programming and Success, Ansley Bredar. The Centre Learning Commons The mission of the Centre Learning Commons (CLC) is to maximize the academic success and personal growth of all Centre students. This is achieved through collaborative relationships among many organizational areas of the college such as Academic Affairs, The Library, the Center for Teaching and Learning, and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Additional collaborators include the Center for Career and Professional Development, Counseling Services, Title IX, Athletics, Student Life, Student Government, and individual academic programs. The CLC draws together and synchronizes existing College-wide initiatives and combines these with an ever-expanding array of student support services, campus resources, and evidence-based programming known to increase students’ academic success and flourishing. Students, faculty, and staff benefit from the CLC’s welcoming, positive, and inclusive ethos, its effective programming, and its own learning culture; assessing, reflecting, collaborating, listening, researching, innovating, and continuously improving. The Centre Learning Commons (CLC) is located on the main floor of the Grace Doherty Library in Crounse Hall, adjacent to Einstein’s Bagels. It is open during the library’s hours of operation. The CLC includes office suites, innovative and tech-savvy spaces for individual and group study, seminar rooms, and an information kiosk. CLC programming and resources include, but are not limited to, comprehensive and inclusive academic peer tutoring and mentoring, assistance with time management and organization strategies, academic support services (e.g. the Writing Center, the Proctoring Center, ESL services, academic accommodations, etc.), study skills and college preparedness workshops, summer programming focused on high-school-to-college transitions and skill building (e.g. math, writing skills, etc.), and extensive web-based and other digital resources. A full listing of these services and resources is available on the CLC website ( https://www.centre.edu/centre-learning-commons/ ). CLC staff implement best practice strategies for providing academic support services to all students, including student populations with specific needs (e.g. learning disabilities, ESL, ASL, and underprepared and/or academically at-risk students). CLC staff also serve as a resource for those seeking advice (students, advisors, faculty) on strategies to improve academic performance, and will assist students in developing individualized study plans, strengthening executive functioning skills, and facilitating self-advocacy. Students are encouraged to contact a member of the CLC staff via email (clc@centre.edu) to schedule a personal consultation. The Center for Career & Professional Development The Center for Career & Professional Development (CCPD) supports students’ holistic development by helping them connect the dots between the knowledge and skills they are gaining both inside and outside the classroom to potential careers, enhancing their career and professional development through programming and services, and providing them with the tools and knowledge necessary for post-graduate success. In 2023, Centre launched Career Exploration Communities (CECs) for students. During FYC, students will have the opportunity to join one or more CEC: Arts, Media & Entertainment; Business & Finance; Health & Medicine; Law, Government & Policy; Science, Engineering & Technology; and Social Impact. Events across campus will be offered through each CEC to help students learn more about potential careers and connect with industry professionals. In addition, each CEC has a dedicated career coach, with specialized knowledge on career field(s) within that CEC. There is also a career coach dedicated to meeting specifically with students who are undeclared or are undecided about their major or CEC choice. Career coaches can walk students through the entire career readiness process, from initial career exploration through applying for jobs or graduate schools. Along the way, career coaches can provide students with self-assessments, help them identify and articulate their skills, teach them how to research careers, help them locate and apply for internships or undergraduate research, assist with resume writing and interview preparation, and assist with locating and applying to post-graduate jobs and graduate schools. In addition, students will be able to connect and network with industry insiders through our extensive network of Career Advocates for each CEC. Finally, the CCPD has a wealth of information and resources on its website, including Handshake, our personal internship and job posting site, and resources tailored to each CEC. Through intentional involvement with the CCPD, Centre graduates experience unparalleled success. On average, 98% of graduates are employed in professional positions or enrolled in graduate or professional school within one year of graduation. Internships Internships are essential in supporting successful careers after graduation. Aside from valuable real-world experience, internships allow students to try out careers, giving them the freedom to begin exploring their futures before graduation. An internship is a form of experiential learning that empowers students to integrate knowledge and theory learned throughout the curriculum with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. Centre offers internship opportunities to all students on a non-credit basis and during the sophomore, junior, and senior years on a credit basis. An internship for academic credit can be completed during all academic terms as well as the summer and includes substantive academic work. The experience is guided by a member of the faculty and by a supervisor at the internship site with oversight by the CCPD. Students may earn two or three credits for their experiences based on hours worked. One-credit internships are also available in the summer for international students and underclass students who are required to receive academic credit by their employer to participate in the program. Students considering this type of internship must meet with their career coach to discuss their options and internship requirements. During the summer, a small fee is charged to complete an academic credit internship. Additionally, internship credit can be applied toward the Connections portion of general education requirements or fulfill elective credit. Academic advisors can provide individual guidance and planning for internships within the academic schedule. Non-credit internships exist for students who want to gain additional insights and experiences related to their potential career choice. This internship does not result in academic credit and is most often completed during the summer. The CCPD can assist in finding these experiences. Both types of internships can be valuable components of a student’s career and professional development process, enabling them to make connections between the college experience and various career fields. Also, interested students may apply for funding (on a competitive basis) for internships taking place during the CentreTerm or the summer. Whether engaging in an internship for academic credit or not, all participating students should report their experience to the Center for Career & Professional Development. Preparation for Careers and Graduate and Professional Schools Medicine and Other Health Professions Medicine is the most popular health-career area at Centre, but our graduates also choose specialized study in fields such as dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, nursing, physical therapy, and veterinary medicine, among others. Biochemistry and molecular biology and biology are the most popular pre-med majors at Centre, but students from every academic major are accepted to medical school. Diversity is, in fact, not only possible, but encouraged by many medical schools, which have come to realize that students who pursue interests in art, music, philosophy, history, literature, and other areas of liberal study tend to become well-rounded, highly effective physicians. In fact, the only science background generally required for admission to medical school is two years of chemistry, one year each of biology and physics, and one semester of biochemistry. However, the MCAT exam, required of all applicants to medical schools, does require a strong understanding of biology, physics, and chemistry, as well as some study of sociology, psychology, and statistics. Centre has established a Health Professions Advisory Committee comprised of faculty members who serve as specialist advisors for each health profession. Each advisor is available to students throughout their four years at Centre (and beyond) to help them plan their courses of study, assist them in exploring the many health-related professions, and support the development of application materials. They maintain close contact with the medical and other pre-health schools to which Centre students apply most frequently. The Health Professions Advisory Committee also conducts interviews with applicants for medical school, gathers individual letters of evaluation, and writes a summary evaluation of candidates as part of a committee letter of evaluation submitted on behalf of applicants. This continuing level of personal attention and concern is an important element in the success of Centre graduates in gaining acceptance to medical and other pre-health schools. Other resources that help Centre students prepare for careers in medicine include the Pre-Health Society and the Health & Medicine Career Exploration Community of the Center for Career and Professional Development. These resources allow students to engage in a variety of activities, such as panel discussions with recent Centre alumni or local health professionals and inviting representatives from professional schools to campus. Other student organizations that support the exploration of careers in healthcare include the Pre-Dental Society, the Pre-Vet Society, and Partners in Health. Law Law schools are interested in students from every academic major, and a liberal arts education equips every student with the skills and aptitude necessary to succeed in law school. English, politics, history, international studies, and economics and finance are the majors most often selected by Centre students who pursue law, but there is no set pre-law major (many STEM students go to law school). Graduates across the many majors at Centre have a solid record of success in gaining admission to law schools and performing very ably once in law school. The broad-based skills that law schools emphasize—effective writing and speaking, analytical ability, and familiarity with the social sciences—are essential goals of Centre’s liberal arts curriculum. At Centre, the faculty pre-law advisor works with students from their first year on to help them explore law as a profession and to assist them in the application process during their junior and senior years. Basic materials and information about law school, the application process, and legal careers are available on the pre-law website: https://www.centre.edu/academics/majors-minors-programs/pre-law. The pre-law advisor hosts a range of workshops throughout the academic year, with topics that include a broad overview of careers related to the law and LSAT studying strategies and resources. There is also an email list and a pre-law Moodle page that pre-law students can join. To help students get the most out of their Centre education, the pre-law advisor provides a list of recommended courses that aid in LSAT skill-building and general law school preparedness. Advisors also counsel interested students on related internship and volunteer opportunities that provide insight into the law field and help students identify and demonstrate their interest in pursuing a legal career. In addition, the Centre for Career and Professional Development hosts several law-related events, including a law school fair and talks with legal professionals. Centre also has the John Marshall Harlan Law Society composed of students interested in law, many of whom go on to legal careers. This organization meets regularly, sponsors field trips to places such as courtrooms and law schools, and brings experts in the legal profession as well as representatives from law schools on campus to speak with students. Education Students interested in pursuing a career in education can choose from a wide range of post-graduate options. Those who wish to earn a master's or teaching certification may choose to enroll at one of our partner universities ( https://www.centre.edu/majors-minors/education/education-partnerships/ ), the University of Louisville, the Peabody College of Education at Vanderbilt, and Bellarmine University. Currently, some of our partnerships allow Centre students to count course observation hours from the education minor towards a master's degree in education. Students who complete an education minor are also well prepared to progress to any graduate school for teaching certification or to alternative programs such as Teach for America, Teach Kentucky, or teaching residency programs ( https://www.centre.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/careers-in-education.pdf ). Students are encouraged to talk with education program faculty about how to match their goals with an appropriate graduate program or alternative track. In addition, while at Centre, students interested in education are encouraged to participate in an internship or research opportunity with a focus in the discipline. Dual-Degree Engineering Program Centre offers dual-degree engineering programs in cooperation with the University of Kentucky and Washington University in St. Louis. In both programs, the student receives a bachelor of science degree from Centre and a bachelor of engineering degree from the partner institution. In the program with Washington University in St. Louis, students also receive an engineering master’s degree. Students typically spend three years at Centre and then two to three years at the engineering school depending on the program and engineering field, though it is also possible to spend four years at Centre before transferring. The program provides a background in the liberal arts and in engineering, which gives dual degree students communication and critical thinking skills that differentiate them from other engineers. Students complete the requirements for a Centre degree—including a major in biology, chemistry, computer science, environmental studies, mathematics, physics, or chemical physics—and the partner university requirements for an engineering degree to earn the dual undergraduate degrees. Additional information is available from the College’s dual-degree engineering studies advisor and the engineering website: https://www.centre.edu/academics/majors-minors-programs/dual-degree-engineering Reserve Officers Training Corps Centre students may participate in the reserve officers training programs of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force through the University of Kentucky. Two-year and four-year Air Force ROTC programs are available. Most courses are offered on the University of Kentucky campus, and students are responsible for their own transportation. Students receive academic credit toward their Centre degrees for the courses listed in this section. Winners of three-and four-year Army or Air Force ROTC scholarships receive, in addition to their support from the Army or Air Force, scholarships covering room and board for the period of the ROTC scholarship. Students may be eligible for additional scholarships or financial aid. NOTE: U.S. Army ROTC is being phased out at Centre. At this time, only students contracted for the Army ROTC scholarship will be allowed to take the courses and complete the program. Disability Services Centre College is committed to fostering respect for the diversity of the College community and the individual rights of each member of that community. In this spirit, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and expanded by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Centre College seeks to provide disabled students with the support services and other reasonable accommodations needed to ensure equal access to the programs and activities of the College. While the College provides a number of services to support the academic work of all its students, this statement outlines a variety of additional services provided specifically to students with mobility, visual, hearing, or learning disabilities. Support services for students with disabilities at Centre College are coordinated by the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX Compliance. This person leads the Office of Accessibility Services and, in close coordination with the Director of the Centre Learning Commons and the Associate Director of Residence Life and Housing Operations, counsels individual students to determine appropriate accommodations and identify resources. These individuals are also available to consult with faculty and staff members. All incoming students with special needs are invited to complete a confidential Accessibility Request Form. A staff member from the Office of Accessibility Services then speaks with students who have identified their needs, and on the basis of the information shared on the Accessibility Request Form and appropriate, current documentation, determines the appropriate services and if necessary,prepares the appropriate forms so that students may notify faculty members of their classroom needs. Arrangements for services, equipment, modification of course material, classroom, and other reasonable accommodations may require several weeks’ advance notice. Applicants requiring special services are encouraged to contact the Office of Accessibility Services via email ( access@centre.edu ) immediately upon acceptance to make timely provision of needed services possible. Academic modifications vary according to individual need and preference, as well as course content and mode of teaching. Students are expected to discuss arrangements that might be necessary with their professors at the beginning of each term. The Director of the Centre Learning Commons is prepared to assist both students and faculty members in making such accommodations. Special housing requests based on documented disabilities may be considered through the joint coordination of the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX Compliance, the Associate Director of Residence Life and Housing Operations, and the Director of Parsons Health Services.
