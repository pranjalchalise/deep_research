Universities and research institutions sponsoring H-1B faculty or staff should take note and review compliance practices. See NAFSA's page . USCIS. USCIS Authorized to Field Its Own Special Agents . In a September 4, 2025 news release USCIS said it is now authorized to hire special agents as sworn law-enforcement officers inside USCIS who can investigate immigration-related crimes, make arrests, carry firearms, and execute search or arrest warrants. USCIS frames this as implementing a DHS delegation so the agency can take investigations \"from start to finish,\" rather than always handing them to ICE/HSI, and to support fraud/national-security/public-safety missions tied to benefits adjudications. The rule that underpins this becomes effective on October 6, 2025. See NAFSA's page . USCIS . USCIS to Consider \"Anti-Americanism,\" \"Anti-Semitism,\" Other Factors in Immigration Benefit Requests . On August 19, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it has expanded the types of benefit requests that receive social media vetting, adding reviews for \"anti-American\" and \"antisemitic\" activity to that vetting, stating that such activity will be \"an overwhelmingly negative factor in any applicable case involving USCIS discretionary analysis.\" See NAFSA's page . DOS . DOS Ends Pause on Adding New F, M, J Visa Appointment Capacity Upon Issuing Guidance on Expansion of Social Media Screening. On June 18, 2025, the Department of State (DOS) instructed consulates worldwide to implement a mandatory expansion of social media vetting for all F, M, and J visa applicants (students and exchange visitors), requiring applicants to make all social media accounts public while consular officers conduct thorough reviews of their entire online presence using search engines and databases to identify \"potentially derogatory information\" including political activism, terrorism support, anti-Semitic activities, or \"hostile attitudes\" toward the United States. F, M, and J visa applications will undergo a two-step process involving standard eligibility review followed by enhanced vetting under INA 221(g) administrative processing. The June 18, 2025 DOS cable that delivered the guidance told consulates that they had five business days from the date of the cable to implement the new protocols, after which they could begin opening up new visa appointments (which had been halted since May 27, 2025). T he fifth business day following June 18 would be June 26, 2025 (not counting the day the cable was issued and taking into account the intervening weekend and the federal holiday of Juneteenth on June 19). Although visa appointment scheduling is resuming, processing capacity may be reduced due to the resource-intensive nature of the expanded screening requirements. This may translate into longer appointment wait and visa processing times. See NAFSA's page for details and additional context. DHS. List of Sanctuary Jurisdictions Defying Federal Immigration Law .

In a review of information collected for admission and benefit decisions, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) identified the need to collect social media identifiers (“handles”) and associated social media platform names from applicants to enable and help inform identity verification, national security and public safety screening, and vetting, and related inspections.\" USCIS will accept comments for 60 days, until May 5, 2025. DHS-USCIS . New Immigration Registration Requirements: Key Points . March 12, 2025. New USCIS guidance requires children who turn 14 while in the U.S. to \"re-register\" with USCIS within 30 days of their birthday, even if previously registered when entering the country. This may affect, for example, F-2, J-2, H-4 dependents and young F-1/J-1 students who entered before age 14. Most nonimmigrants who entered the U.S. at age 14+ are already automatically registered (as evidenced by their Form I-94) and DON'T need to re-register. This is also a good time to remind noncitizens to carry their registration document and timely report address changes. A USCIS interim final rule published at 90 FR 11793 (March 12, 2025) , Alien Registration Form and Evidence of Registration, effective April 11, 2025 designates a new \"Form G-325R, Biographic Information (Registration) to implement the registration and fingerprinting process.

Two recent changes impact the interim work authorization employment authorization documents (EADs) that adjustment of status (adjustment) applicants are eligible for. First, effective October 30, 2025 a USCIS interim final rule ended the USCIS practice of automatically extending the validity of EADs for adjustment applicants who apply to renew their adjustment-based EAD.

The DHS/ICE proposed rule to end \"duration of status\" for F, J, and I nonimmigrants was published in the Federal Register on August 28, 2025. Comments are due by September 29, 2025. NAFSA Comments on DHS Proposal to Eliminate D/S . NAFSA submitted comments to DHS opposing the DHS proposal to eliminate “duration of status” (D/S) admissions for F and J nonimmigrants and to impose constraints on academic mobility. In its September 29, 2025 letter, NAFSA urged DHS to withdraw the rule, arguing it would replace a longstanding effective system with duplicative extension-of-stay requirements, increase burdens on students, scholars, schools, and exchange programs, and strain already backlogged USCIS processing, without achieving DHS's stated goals. Read NAFSA's comment letter , and see NAFSA's page analyzing the proposed rule . Statute. Budget Law Imposes New Immigration Fees. July 4, 2025. H.R.1, the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" signed into law on July 4, 2025, imposes several new immigration fees, including a \"visa integrity fee,\" a new Form I-94 application fee, an EVUS fee, a new TPS fee, and other fees. On July 22, 2025 USCIS will publish a Federal Register notice to implement collection of certain (but not all) of the HR-1 budget law's new immigration fees, effective as of the July 22 publication in the Federal Register. The notice clarifies, though, that the new Visa Integrity and Form I-94 fees will not be collected under the July 22, 2025 notice but rather in separate future Federal Register notices.

A news outlet reported in March, 2025 that an unpublished Social Security Administration (SSA) memo informed SSA offices that it \"is temporarily pausing the Enumeration-Beyond-Entry (EBE) process for noncitizens granted work authorization (I-765).\" The EBE program, described in the SSA Program Operations Manual System (POMS) at RM 10205.700 , is an agreement between SSA and USCIS in effect since 2017 that allows certain individuals to apply for work authorization and a social security number (SSN) at the same time by answering related questions on Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. No further information is available since the March 20, 2025 Popular Information article, including whether the temporary pause is still active. See NAFSA's page for background. DOS. Visa Interview Wait Time Once Again Available on DOS Web Page. Average visa interview wait time information is once again available on the Department of State's Global Visa Wait Times page on travel.state.gov.

In a February 18, 2025 Interview Waiver Update the Department of State announced changes to its policies on eligibility for waivers of the in-person visa interview requirement. The update rescinds prior expansions of interview waiver authority, for example, reinstating the statutory 12-month post-expiration period for applicants who previously held a visa in the same category. This marks a shift from the previous policy, which allowed interview waivers for applicants whose prior visa had expired within the past 48 months. See NAFSA's page . DHS-USCIS .
