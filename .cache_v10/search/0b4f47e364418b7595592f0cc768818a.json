      "snippet": "### Body\n\nImmigration continues to play a large role in the 2024 US presidential race, with former president Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris now running against each other, following President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s withdrawal from the race on July 21, 2024. Trump has focused on immigration in his campaign, dedicating time at nearly every campaign stop to border issues and his plans to fix them should he win reelection. Immigration dominated every night of the 2024 Republican National Convention and was a major point of contention at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024. Now, Trump is blaming Harris for the border crisis, labeling her Biden's \"border czar\" and attacking her immigration record in political ads. [...] | Sources: Trump has vowed on many occasions to carry out the \"largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\" Stephen Miller outlined and endorsed the policy proposal on November 11, 2023, in a comprehensive interview with the New York Times on Trump's 2025 immigration plans, and the proposal was also highlighted at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024.  As for the specifics of this policy proposal, Trump promised to move troops to the US border to carry out deportations several times, including at a campaign rally on October 29, 2023, in an op-ed for the Des Moines Register on January 3, 2024, and in an interview with Time Magazine on April 30, 2024. Miller endorsed the authorization of ICE workplace raids in both a podcast interview on November 14, 2023, and his [...] | Sources: Trump specifically pledged to build an additional 200 miles of border wall during his keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 4, 2023. He again endorsed this proposal in an interview with Time Magazine on April 30, 2024. More recently, Trump promised to finish \"the wall\" in his address to the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2024. |"

      "snippet": "As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, immigration remains a central theme. Former President Donald Trump advocates for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, restricting entry for refugees and asylum seekers, reinstating the Remain in Mexico program, expanding the border wall, and reducing worker visas. He also proposes banning entry from Muslim-majority countries and ending DACA protections, which offers protection from deportation and a work permit, requiring renewal every two years, as a path to citizenship for individuals who were under 16 when they were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents before June 15, 2012. [...] ### The economic impact of the candidates' proposals\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll from October 2024, 21% of Americans view immigration as the most pressing non-economic concern. A joint study by Brookings, AEI, and the Niskanen Center analyzed high- and low-immigration scenarios under each candidate’s plan and found that net immigration would be far higher under Harris’s policies, with a forecasted net migration of 3.7 million in 2025 vs. Trump’s forecasted net migration of 740,000. [...] Such differences in immigration levels would directly impact economic growth. Harris’s policies could expand the labor force and boost GDP, while Trump’s measures could reduce GDP growth by as much as half a percentage point in 2025 alone—equivalent to about $130 billion. A Peterson Institute study warns that mass deportations under Trump’s plan would create inflationary pressures by shrinking the labor supply, driving up the cost of goods and services by several percentage points annually throughout his second term."

      "snippet": "Polls show that voters do not support cruel enforcement-only measures that betray core American values and put vulnerable people in danger. Proposals to ban asylum and separate families at the border are widely rejected by voters. A March 2024 Immigration Hub / GSG poll shows that 66 percent of voters in battleground states reject banning asylum, and 79 percent oppose reinstating family separation. Recent research conducted by the ACLU also showed that when candidates, regardless of party affiliation, adopt a balanced, solutions-focused approach to immigration that includes both managing the border and providing a road to citizenship for long-term residents, they outperform their opponents’ fear-based messages. [...] Source: American Civil Liberties Union\n\nIn this paper, we focus on three areas of significant threats to immigrants and the U.S. communities and families they are a part of, should Trump be elected to a second term. The first is mass deportation: A central promise of Trump’s 2024 campaign is to “carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” once in office. Second, we explore some of Trump’s and his surrogates’ plans to target the core rights of children and families: attacking birthright citizenship, barring undocumented children from schools, and again forcibly separating children from their parents at the border. Finally, we will turn to the Trump team’s strategy to dismantle our nation’s asylum protection system and attack human rights at the border. [...] > “They’re poisoning the blood of our country. That’s what they’ve done. They poison — mental institutions and prisons all over the world. Not just in South America. Not just the three or four countries that we think about. But all over the world they’re coming into our country — from Africa, from Asia, all over the world. They’re pouring into our country.” — Dec. 16, 2023, New Hampshire rally\n>\n> “They’re rough people, in many cases from jails, prisons, from mental institutions, insane asylums. You know, insane asylums — that’s ‘Silence of the Lambs’ stuff.” — March 4, 2024, interview with Right Side Broadcasting Network\n>"

      "snippet": "For the past two decades, as public discontent has risen, elected leaders in Washington have failed either to enforce or to update our obsolete immigration laws. Donald Trump rode the issue to his improbable victory in 2016. Eight years later, President Biden’s failure to control immigration at the United States’ southern border generated a massive public backlash. By July of 2024, 55% of surveyed Americans wanted immigration to be reduced, 53% supported building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and nearly half wanted all immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally to be deported, regardless of their work history and conduct while in the United States. Former President Trump highlighted immigration during his 2024 campaign, and post-election surveys showed that it had contributed [...] What happened?\n\nLet’s begin with general attitudes. According to polling by The Economist/YouGov from July 11 to 14, 2025, 52% percent of Americans think that President Trump’s approach to immigration has been “too harsh,” compared to 36% who think it has been “about right.” Similarly, 54% say that in enforcing immigration laws, ICE agents have gone “too far,” while only 27% say that their actions are “about right.” Four years ago, a majority of Americans thought that former President Biden wasn’t tough enough in dealing with immigration; now they believe that President Trump has made the opposite mistake.\n\nBacking up these overall negative impressions are procedural objections to the way the Trump administration is carrying out its policies."

      "snippet": "## Introduction\n\nImmigration was a central campaign issue during the 2024 Presidential election with President-elect Trump vowing to take strict action to restrict both lawful and unlawful immigration into the U.S. Such actions would have stark impacts on the health and well-being of immigrant families as well as major economic consequences for the nation. As of 2023, there were 47.1 million immigrants residing in the U.S., and one in four children had an immigrant parent.1  Increased immigration boosts federal revenues and lowers the national deficit through immigrants’ participation in the country’s economy, workforce, and through billions of dollars in tax contributions.

President-elect Trump said he plans to reinstate the Migrant Protection Protocols. He also has indicated that he will deploy the National Guard, as well as active duty military personnel, if needed, to the U.S.-Mexico border, although details of the plan remain unclear. Heightened military presence at the border can lead to increased fears among immigrant families living in border areas and using part of the military budget for border security could face legal challenges."
