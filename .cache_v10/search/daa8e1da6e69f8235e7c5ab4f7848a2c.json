      "snippet": "May 30, 2025\n\nU.S. immigration continues to be one of the most hotly contested issues on the Hill and in statehouses across the country because it impacts a wide swath of communities in every corner of America.\n\nFor more than a decade, high-profile members of Congress – Democrats and Republicans alike – have called for changes to border policy, but disagree on how to get there and what success looks like. As a result, progress toward immigration policy change has been slow and difficult. But for government affairs professionals, tracking legislative and regulatory updates remains a critical task. [...] Some research supports the idea that an immigration surge could translate into higher housing costs, according to January 2025 reporting from Bloomberg, noting that while economists from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) see the surge having little overall impact on inflation in the next decade, they say the “greatest upward pressure” will come from higher housing demand.\n\nIn addition, because state and local governments tend to be responsible for basic services, a surge in immigration often raises their spending more than their revenues. For example, a 2024 CBO report found that the revenue local governments raised from newly arrived immigrants paying state income and property taxes is typically less than the education and health-care costs incurred. [...] Furthermore, when it comes to immigration in general (aside from workforce trends), the United States continues to have more immigrants than any other country – with “one-fifth of the world’s international migrants” making their home in the U.S., according to a September 2024 report from Pew Research Center. Reasons for immigration can include poverty, attempts to escape violence, work or educational opportunities, or reunification with family.\n\nDuring modern times, U.S. immigration also continues to increase. In states including California, Texas, Florida, and New York, immigrants account for about one in five residents, according to a January 2025 Bloomberg news report."

      "snippet": "USCIS published a Policy Memorandum on Sept. 4, 2025, reaffirming its strict adherence to statutory and regulatory language determining whether a Form I-485 green card applicant is inadmissible based on the ground of public charge. This Policy Memorandum does not change the law; rather, it is essentially a reminder that USCIS has the discretion to make a public charge determination based on the totality of the circumstances. When making its subjective determination, the USCIS officer considers factors such as the applicant's age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status and education and skills, as well as an Affidavit of Support when legally required to consider and the foreign national's receipt of government benefits as defined by the regulation of public case [...] DHS announced on Oct. 15, 2025, the implementation of a new $1,000 parole fee effective Oct. 16, 2025, for any foreign national who is paroled into the U.S. unless he or she qualifies for one of 10 exceptions. If required, the fee is not paid when the parole application is submitted to USCIS, but DHS will collect the $1,000 fee after it determines in its discretion that the foreign national will be granted parole and the foreign national appears for inspection at a port of entry to enter the U.S. or is already physically present in the U.S. The 10 exceptions include certain instances involving a medical emergency and related treatment, the foreign national coming to the U.S. to visit a close family member whose death is imminent, the foreign national coming to the U.S. to attend a funeral [...] TPS remains active for Burma (Myanmar) (registration for eligible individuals remains open through Nov. 25, 2025), El Salvador (effective EADs valid through Sept. 9, 2026, and EADs auto-extended through March 9, 2026), Ethiopia (effective EADs valid through Dec. 12, 2025), Lebanon (effective EADs valid through May 27, 2026, and registration available through May 27, 2026), Somalia, South Sudan (effective EADs were valid through Nov. 3, 2025) and Sudan (designated extended through Oct. 19, 2026, and effective EADs through April 19, 2026).\n\nTPS status for Venezuela continues to be the subject of ongoing litigation and was initially terminated, but then was restored on Oct. 3, 2025, by the U.S. Supreme Court through Nov. 7, 2025.\n\n## Cessation of Automatic Extension of EADs"

      "snippet": "USCIS has returned to a commonsense policy for issuing Notices to Appear (NTA), and since February 2025 has issued more than 172,000 NTAs to restore integrity and ensure the security of our nation’s immigration system. The agency is committed to using its NTA authorities against removable aliens and will no longer exempt specific classes or categories from potential enforcement.   \n  \nDHS announced an interim final rule ending the practice of automatically extending employment authorization documents for aliens filing renewal applications in certain employment authorization categories. With this rule, DHS prioritizes the proper screening and vetting of aliens before extending the validity of their employment authorizations. [...] WASHINGTON — Under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Director Joseph Edlow, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has taken critical steps to restore sanity and integrity to our immigration system. Since Jan. 20, 2025, USCIS has closed loopholes and implemented critically needed changes to better protect American communities and workers. [...] USCIS is implementing rigorous screening and vetting protocols and actively assisting ICE and other law enforcement partners to enforce immigration law and protect public safety. Since Jan. 20, 2025, USCIS has referred almost 3,200 individuals with orders of removal, active wants/warrants and other criminal indicators to ICE and other law enforcement entities, resulting in the apprehension of   almost 2,000 criminal and illegal aliens at USCIS facilities since Jan. 20, 2025.  In addition, since Jan. 20, 2025, USCIS has made 13,225 referrals to ICE for fraud, public safety and national security concerns, including 320 for confirmed or suspected Foreign Terrorist Organization gang members. Press releases highlighting USCIS involvement in arrests and convictions can be found in the USCIS"
