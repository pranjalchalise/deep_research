      "snippet": "Chapter 2 AN ESSAY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF GENETIC PROGRAMMING Lee Spector Cognitive Science Hampshire College Amherst, MA 01002 USA lspector@hampshire.edu Abstract This chapter presents a personal perspective on the relation between theory and practice in genetic programming. It posits that genetic pro-gramming practice (including both applications and technique enhance-ments) is moving toward biology and that it should continue to do so. [...] Genetic programming, by which I mean the specialization of “genetic and evolutionary computation” to systems that evolve executable com-puter programs, arose later, in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. In the succeeding years, genetic programming theory and practice (in which I include both applications-oriented work and development of new tech-niques) have both undergone steady progress, although not always in a coordinated ways.\nWith the basic theory already established, system builders and appli-cations engineers felt free to experiment with variations (“hack”), with-out paying much attention to mathematical theory. For the theorists, on the other hand, there was much work to be done in clarifying and developing the mathematics, irrespective of the activities of the hackers. [...] For example, recent advances in genetic programming schema the-ory have broadened its applicability to include variable-length and tree-structured genomes, along with popular mutation and crossover algo-rithms (see, for example, Poli, 2001). This was a substantial and suc-cessful mathematical undertaking, but for all of its successes it captures a state of the art that is already about 10 years old. During the inter-vening decade practice has ﬂowered, producing much more complex and capable systems for which there is not yet a strong theoretical frame-work."
