      "snippet": "The bulk of manufacturing is done by people, says Akella, and before now there has not been much data coming from the manual lines operating within a manufacturing facility. But with Drishti’s technology data can be collected and visibility can be given into an operation.\n\nThis allows companies to better analyze what processes may need to be improved and how they can go about doing so. It also offers opportunities to improve training by showing workers video of proper and improper procedures. Issues can be addressed in real time and from far distances using this technology, further benefiting manufacturers.\n\nRead our Q&A with Prasad Akella to learn more about Drishti's technology and the benefits of using AI and video in manufacturing operations.\n\n## About the Author\n\nEmail [...] Video\n\n# Drishti Combines AI and Video to Improve Manufacturing Operations\n\nUse of artificial intelligence and computer vision allows better data collection and visibility into manufacturing lines to make real-time improvements.\n\nSara Jensen\n\nRelated To:\n\nDrishti\n\nMay 5, 2022\n\nPrasad Akella, founder of Drishti, says the company brings together artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technology to help optimize manual assembly processes in manufacturing operations.

      "snippet": "Despite robotics hype, humans are manufacturing’s largest value creators. But methods for measuring human activity have not changed since Henry Ford. Manufacturers struggle to optimize human tasks at scale. Some believe human efficiency has peaked. Drishti’s pioneering computer vision uses artificial intelligence (AI) to digitize human activities in the factory and allows manufacturers to benefit from human analytics for the first time. Drishti’s dataset drives a future in which technology does not displace people; it makes them more valuable. [...] > Good data drives good decisions. But manufacturers have historically lacked sufficient data on human actions. Consequently, they have traded people for robots, giving up flexibility. In contrast, Drishti's unique dataset on manual operations extends human potential for true digital transformation.

      "snippet": "What's so exciting about the field? \"Being able to create something innovative with the help of a laptop and a few codes is really fascinating,\" she said. At Jacobs University, she also discovered her enthusiasm for hackathons. These are competitions in which participants have to find a creative, technical solution to a specific problem within a limited time. \"Amazing innovations often come out of those,\" Drishti said. She was so taken with it that in 2019 she and some fellow students from Nepal set up their country's first international hackathon, Everest Hack. The event was a huge success. Now, the hackathon culture is growing in Nepal as well. [...] Most of the participants even in the hackathons she attended were men, of course. \"As a child, I was often told that certain subjects were only for boys,\" Drishti recalled. For girls, she said, there was a lack of support; there were also no female teachers in the relevant subjects, no female role models. \"In some classes at school, I was sometimes the only girl among 40 boys. That felt weird.\"\n\nThat changed at Jacobs University, at least a little. \"I was super happy when I suddenly discovered fellow female students in my classes.\" However, her friends were quick to point out to her that men dominate math, science and technical subjects in Germany, too. \"There just needs to be more support for women, not just in Nepal, but here too.\" [...] She also received guidance during her time at the university, for example from Peter Zaspel, Professor of Computer Science. He supported her in writing her bachelor's thesis, which was honored with the Zeiss Women Award. Previously, at Zaspel's suggestion, she had already been awarded the Deans Prize, with which Jacobs University recognizes outstanding theses by its students.\n\n\"Drishti's work has a level that is often not even reached in master's theses,\" Zaspel said. \"It opens the door to a new field for upcoming work on data-driven methods in scientific visualization.\" At issue is a software program called ParaView that visualizes fluids such as blood or water. Drishti introduced novel features in ParaView by incorporating machine learning into the software."
