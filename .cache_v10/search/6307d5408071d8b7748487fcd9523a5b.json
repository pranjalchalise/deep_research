In other words, the expected cost to the US economy of the planned restrictions on immigration is 2 to 5 times larger than for protectionism. [...] Recent prospective evaluations of the expected immigration policy during Donald Trump’s man- date are not positive. Several analyses, among which McKibbin et al., 2024, is an authority, have developed different scenarios based on macro-models of the US economy. These scenarios focus on the expulsion of unauthorized workers who are, in the large majority, unqualified. Therefore, they ignore the consequences of policies affecting authorized migrants, including those with a high level of education. Effects by scenario on the US Gross Domestic Product are graphically represented in figure 10. Depending on the magnitude of migrant expulsion, the impact would be significantly different in level. However, by design, the models used for these prospective evaluations predict similar dynamics. [...] into reduced employment by 6.5% and the GDP by 7.4% (see figure 10.b). In other words, this is equivalent to a scenario of no growth during the Trump mandate. Additionally, inflation would go up by 3.5 percent –assuming the FED reacts – and the federal government would lose more than $860 billion in revenue over 10 years (Edwards and Ortega, 2016, ; Gitis and Collins, 2015; Lynch and Ettlinger, 2024; McKibbin et al., 2024; Wolgin, 2015). In comparison, evaluations of the economic impact of a strong protectionist policy with a 10% rise in tariffs toward all countries, a 60% one toward China and Chinese reprisals conclude only to a fall in US GDP by 1.3% (Bouët et al., 2024). This highlights that the US economy is significantly more dependent on foreign workers than on foreign imports."

This is the first analysis to project the short-term and long-term impact of the Trump administration’s policies on both illegal and legal immigration. Due to fewer workers in [...] Fewer workers will result in a reduction in the goods and services the U.S. economy produces. The policies would reduce the projected cumulative goods and services produced (GDP) in America by $1.9 trillion, or $5,612 per person, from 2025 to 2028, and by $12.1 trillion, or $34,369 per person, from 2025 to 2035. The Trump administration’s immigration policies would result in a potential labor loss of approximately 19 million worker years from 2025 to 2028 and 102 million worker years from 2025 to 2035 for the U.S. economy. That is why the policies are projected to lead to a substantial decline in goods and services produced in America. 9 Future refugee admissions will be close to zero, according to press reports. “Mr. Trump also is planning to slash the number of refugees allowed into the [...] higher since January, it has declined from 61.7% in August 2024 to 61.6% in August 2025. “It is wrong to assume that shrinking immigration helps U.S. workers when job growth slows,” said labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy. “Immigrants both create demand for the goods and services produced by U.S.-born workers and work alongside them in ways that increase productivity for both groups. While it is just one factor, we shouldn't be surprised that opportunities for U.S.-born workers are falling at the same time an estimated one million fewer immigrants may be in the labor force.”8 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POLICIES WILL RESULT IN FEWER WORKERS The Trump administration’s policies on legal immigration alone are projected to reduce the number of"

      "snippet": "Similarly, according to the same report, the agricultural industry saw a total drop in employment of 155,000 workers from March 2025 to July 2025 — compared to a 2.2% increase in March 2024 to July 2024. While the researchers cautioned that it was too early to draw firm conclusions, they noted that the cost of fresh vegetables and meat (both beef and pork) rose by a similar rate over that period, suggesting upwards price pressures may be caused by labor force disruption due to Trump’s immigration operations.\n\nIndividual examples of businesses show that immigration raids and the stripping of legal status are having an impact around the country: [...] Beyond California, states around the country are seeing impacts on their workforces not only from the Trump administration’s raids but also from efforts to strip legal status from many people in the U.S. legally.  A new report from Economic Insights and Research Consulting found that deportations are already having an impact on the agricultural supply and on the construction industry. The 10 states with the highest concentration of undocumented immigrants in the construction industry saw a 0.1% drop in construction employment at a time when other states saw a 1.9% increase. The hospitality industry also showed a huge drop in growth, with the labor force rising just 0.2% in June 2025, compared to 1.5% in June 2024. [...] Seven months into President Trump’s term, immigration enforcement operations continue to ramp up, and the broader economic impacts are beginning to come into view. Rather than focus on the “worst of the worst,” the Trump administration has increasingly targeted worksites for immigration raids, picking up delivery drivers, street vendors, farmworkers, meatpackers, and others working in industries across the country. While it is too early to tell the full impact of the expanding mass deportation operations on the American economy and way of life, the warning signs are flashing red."

      "snippet": "The first year of the second Trump administration has seen dramatic changes in immigration policy, resulting in a sharp slowdown in net migration to the United States. We expect the pattern of restrictive policy and increased enforcement to continue or intensify through the coming year. Building on work released in late 2024 and mid-2025, we use available data combined with judgment to estimate a range of likely outcomes for net migration for the years 2025 and 2026. We conclude that net migration was likely close to zero or negative over calendar year 2025 for the first time in at least half a century. Specifically, we estimate that net migration was between –295,000 and -10,000 for the year. For 2026, we project net migration is likely to remain in negative territory. These figures come [...] All told, we estimate that the reductions in labor supply and consumer spending from changes to immigration policy affected GDP growth in 2025 by between –0.2 percentage point (high scenario) and –0.3 percentage point (low scenario). For calendar year 2026, the effect will be between –0.1 percentage point (high) and –0.3 percentage point (low). An implicit assumption here is that the Federal Reserve does not loosen monetary policy in response to the lower potential employment growth that results from reduced immigration. [...] The reductions in aggregate consumer spending that result from the change in immigration policy are significant in dollar terms. We estimate that the factors that lower consumer spending by immigrants result in between $40 billion and $60 billion less spending in 2025 than in 2024. In 2026, consumer spending is projected to be further reduced by $10 billion to $40 billion. Those are useful estimates to keep in mind as some businesses report unexpected weakness in consumer demand."

      "snippet": "Although the postpandemic immigration surge slowed by mid-2024, policies the new administration implemented this year have already led to further reductions in this type of immigration in terms of both less inflow and higher outflow (the latter reflecting more deportations). The slowdown in unauthorized immigrant inflows will have important implications for growth of the labor force and economy and may impact wages and prices. Increases in the foreign-born population accounted for most labor force and population growth in recent years. Unlike previous influxes of unauthorized immigrants, during the latest instance many postpandemic arrivals were granted temporary protections, allowed to enter the country and issued work permits. [...] Our estimates show that an unexpected increase in net unauthorized immigration raises U.S. output growth for about two years but has almost no effect on inflation. Applying these estimates to our baseline policy scenario, which assumes that net unauthorized immigration remains at its spring 2025 level, annual GDP growth is about 0.8 percentage point lower than it would have been if net unauthorized immigration would have evolved as in the CBO’s latest demographic projection. The CBO estimates reflect the laws and policies in place in November 2024 and, hence, do not incorporate immigration policy changes after January 2025. [...] The U.S. experienced an unprecedented immigration surge from 2021 to 2024, driven mainly by an influx of immigrants crossing the Southwest border without visas. Many were released into the country after encountering the Border Patrol.\n\nThese immigrants were issued humanitarian parole, allowed to enter the U.S. to seek asylum or given notice to appear in immigration court. Others entered the country illegally without encountering enforcement personnel. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that 7.3 million “other foreign nationals,” unauthorized immigrants or immigrants with some form of quasi-legal status, but not valid visas, were added to the U.S. population on net during 2021–24. This dwarfed the prepandemic annual average of about 100,000.(#n1)"
