He also has indicated that he will deploy the National Guard, as well as active duty military personnel, if needed, to the U.S.-Mexico border, although details of the plan remain unclear. Heightened military presence at the border can lead to increased fears among immigrant families living in border areas and using part of the military budget for border security could face legal challenges. [...] ## Introduction\n\nImmigration was a central campaign issue during the 2024 Presidential election with President-elect Trump vowing to take strict action to restrict both lawful and unlawful immigration into the U.S. Such actions would have stark impacts on the health and well-being of immigrant families as well as major economic consequences for the nation. As of 2023, there were 47.1 million immigrants residing in the U.S., and one in four children had an immigrant parent.1  Increased immigration boosts federal revenues and lowers the national deficit through immigrants’ participation in the country’s economy, workforce, and through billions of dollars in tax contributions.

As of November 2024, President-elect Trump has not indicated whether his administration plans to reinstate his first term changes to public charge policy."

      "snippet": "### Body\n\nImmigration continues to play a large role in the 2024 US presidential race, with former president Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris now running against each other, following President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s withdrawal from the race on July 21, 2024. Trump has focused on immigration in his campaign, dedicating time at nearly every campaign stop to border issues and his plans to fix them should he win reelection. Immigration dominated every night of the 2024 Republican National Convention and was a major point of contention at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024. Now, Trump is blaming Harris for the border crisis, labeling her Biden's \"border czar\" and attacking her immigration record in political ads. [...] | Sources: Trump first announced this policy proposal during a podcast interview on June 20, 2024. The Trump campaign further clarified this policy on June 21, 2024, in a statement to ABC News. | [...] | Sources: Trump has vowed on many occasions to carry out the \"largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\" Stephen Miller outlined and endorsed the policy proposal on November 11, 2023, in a comprehensive interview with the New York Times on Trump's 2025 immigration plans, and the proposal was also highlighted at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024.  As for the specifics of this policy proposal, Trump promised to move troops to the US border to carry out deportations several times, including at a campaign rally on October 29, 2023, in an op-ed for the Des Moines Register on January 3, 2024, and in an interview with Time Magazine on April 30, 2024. Miller endorsed the authorization of ICE workplace raids in both a podcast interview on November 14, 2023, and his"

      "snippet": "Still, overall deportations remained well below the stated goal of 1 million per year and even below the number during Joe Biden’s final year as president. However, limited data releases by the Trump administration make it difficult to compare the records. In December, ICE stated DHS had “removed” 622,000 noncitizens under Trump, whereas the Biden administration carried out 778,000 total repatriations in fiscal year (FY) 2024, including noncitizens denied entry at airports and U.S. borders. It appears that DHS’s count includes both removals from within U.S. communities and returns of individuals who crossed the border without authorization. Unlike in prior administrations, DHS has not publicly broken down the number of removals and returns under Trump or detailed the number of [...] On his first day in office, Trump suspended refugee resettlement, although the administration later resettled a small number of White South Africans. Only 506 refugees were resettled from February to October, 342 of them from South Africa, compared to just over 100,000 resettlements in FY 2024. The ceiling for resettlement in FY 2026 was set at a record-low 7,500, and just 720 refugees were resettled from October through December 2025 (see Figure 3). The commensurate slashing of refugee funding has resulted in refugee-serving organizations across the country closing and leaving many refugees with little support. In June, the State Department reallocated $250 million originally intended for resettled refugees to support DHS’s self-deportation program. [...] Associated Press. 2025.

      "snippet": "In June 2024, however, the Biden administration issued its own executive order that temporarily suspended the right to seek asylum for those who did not arrive at an official point of entry, or without an appointment using CBP One, a mobile application. In September, asylum restrictions were tightened further.\n\nTrump has also halted the US refugee resettlement programme. Under Biden in 2024, the US accepted more than 100,000 refugees - its highest since 1995.\n\nHe also ended a major Biden-era programme that allowed up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly into the US on humanitarian grounds. [...] Border crossings significantly dropped in Biden's final year as president. In December 2024 - the last full month of the Biden administration - about 47,330 migrant apprehensions were recorded, down from a high of nearly 250,000 in December 2023.\n\nThe figures are lower than the monthly averages in Trump's first term, before the Covid-19 pandemic. In May 2019, for example, border patrol agents recorded 132,800 migrant encounters.\n\n## Halting the processing of migrants and asylum seekers\n\nIn an executive order, Trump suspended the entry of all undocumented migrants to the US, and border patrol agents have been instructed to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings.\n\nBefore the order, migrants were able to arrive at the US border and had the legal right to seek asylum. [...] Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it?\n From snowy cities to Mexican border - Trump deportations loom\n 'No choice but to go back' - migrants despair over Trump border restrictions\n\nExpedited removals were previously limited to areas within 100 miles (160km) of US international borders, and applied to those who did not request asylum or failed to show a legitimate case for asylum.\n\nWith Trump's changes, these removals can now occur anywhere in the US, and will apply to undocumented migrants who can't prove that they have been in the country for more than two years.\n\nDeportations are not unique to the Trump administration.\n\nBiden carried out deportations as well, with 271,000 immigrants deported to 192 countries in fiscal year 2024."

The Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, has largely succeeded in setting the terms of the debate – hammering away at his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, with hyperbolic claims that she supports “open borders” and false accusations that the US is experiencing a wave of violent crime committed by migrants. [...] Implications of a “mass deportation” policy\n\nOne of the most dangerous aspects of Trump’s immigration policy is his promise of mass deportation, a policy that would have devastating human and economic consequences. Millions of families would be torn apart, as many undocumented immigrants live in “mixed-status” households, where one or more family members are US citizens or legal residents. According to a paper published by the Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS), mass deportation would break up nearly 5 million American families. This would leave millions of US-born children without their parents, a humanitarian disaster given its incalculable psychological and emotional impact on children and families. [...] And what of a Harris administration? Most analysts foresee – and the 2024 Democratic Party Platform posits – a policy mix fundamentally similar to the Biden administration, combining lawful migration pathways with strong enforcement mechanisms and a push for Congressional action on comprehensive immigration reform. Candidate Harris has blamed Trump for pressuring Senate Republicans to vote against a border bill that narrowly failed to pass in May 2024 (the bill was also opposed by several Democrats, who considered it too punitive toward migrants). But by and large the Democratic nominee has not chosen to directly engage Trump on the specifics of immigration policy. The country awaits some future political season for the return of an honest, bipartisan, fact-based discussion of immigration"
