It involves managing the data that drives component behavior and appearance dynamically. From simple values to complex objects, state in React reflects the current state of the application's UI and logic. [...] In summary, React state management is crucial for enterprise applications because it enables scalability, modularity, data consistency, performance optimization, collaborative development, and effective debugging and testing. By leveraging React's state management features and best practices, enterprises can build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications that meet the demands of modern business environments.\n\n3. Top React State Management Libraries\n\nAround 90 different state management libraries can be found in the GitHub repository. But, here we only mentioned those that clearly stand out from the crowd based on a variety of distinguishing features. [...] Whether you opt for built-in React state management features like useState and context API or choose external libraries like Redux, MobX, Recoil, or Zustand, it's essential to prioritize simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency. Experimentation, prototyping, and staying open to adapting your approach based on evolving requirements are key to finding the optimal state management solution for your project."

This global state is like a single source of truth for our application, making state management more predictable and easier to reason about.\n\nFor instance, using the Context API, we can create a context with an initial state and use the Provider component to make this state available to all components in our React app. Any component can then access this state using the useContext hook and dispatch actions to modify the state.\n\n``` [...] React state management libraries like Redux, MobX, and the built-in Context API, among others, allow us to store states in a global store that can be accessed from any component in our React application.

Lastly, we emphasized the importance of testing in state management to ensure that our React components function as expected and our application runs smoothly. With these strategies, you can effectively manage state in your large React applications and build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. ‍ State in React is a powerful feature that allows React components to be dynamic and interactive. By managing the state, we can track changes in a React application and render components based on the current state. However, managing the state in large React applications can be challenging."

      "snippet": "## Understanding State Management\n\nIn React development, State Management is the process of tracking how your application data changes over time, maintaining data flows, and defining the state of data at any moment. The built-in state object in React components encapsulates the data where developers store assets that are persistent across component renderings.  \nWith all of this in mind, we can start thinking of how React applications can model behaviors based on the state of the data. But that still leaves a few unanswered questions: How do you implement state in a React app? How do you read it? How do you change it?\n\n### The built-in solution in React [...] ### React State Management libraries\n\nThere are several types of React libraries for State Management, but today we will focus on three: Contextual, Atomic and Hook-Based libraries. As expected, different state management libraries use different approaches to achieve the same or similar solutions. They also differ from each other in terms of library size, support for languages, documentation, API support, and more.\n\n#### Contextual\n\nWe can find two of the most popular state management libraries in this category: the React-Context API and Redux (RTK). The main goal of contextual libraries is to share the state through the entire app using Flux, an architectural pattern.\n\nLet’s imagine an app that is defined like this:\n\nIn this graph, the Component A will: [...] ### The built-in solution in React\n\nOne of the most notable methods to manage state in React applications is the one encouraged by the official React documentation: Hooks. Hooks are great on their own because they help developers write shorter, more readable code that is easy to share and maintain.\n\nHowever, while it is true that hooks like useState anduseReducer give a lot of usage and flexibility for Components, in most cases using them doesn’t prevent other problems like Prop Drilling (even using composition) or errors in shared data between different branches in the components tree."

In this group, we have Redux and Zustand.\n Atom-based: splits states into tiny pieces of data called atoms, which can be written to and read from using React hooks. In this group, we have Recoil and Jotai.\n Mutable-based: leverages proxy to create mutable data sources which can be directly written to or reactively read from. Candidates in this group are MobX and Valtio."
