      "snippet": "In anticipation of the massive scale of arrest and detention these plans will require, Trump’s advisors are already trying to get Americans used to the idea that the landscape will be dotted with “vast” immigrant detention camps. Trump could again attempt to divert funds from other purposes in order to build these camps, just as he did when building his wall.\n\n### Legal Analysis & Litigation Response\n\nTrump’s plan would require his administration to trample on numerous fundamental protections set out in the Constitution and laws passed by Congress. It would therefore be vulnerable to legal challenge from multiple angles. [...] Polls show that voters do not support cruel enforcement-only measures that betray core American values and put vulnerable people in danger. Proposals to ban asylum and separate families at the border are widely rejected by voters. A March 2024 Immigration Hub / GSG poll shows that 66 percent of voters in battleground states reject banning asylum, and 79 percent oppose reinstating family separation. Recent research conducted by the ACLU also showed that when candidates, regardless of party affiliation, adopt a balanced, solutions-focused approach to immigration that includes both managing the border and providing a road to citizenship for long-term residents, they outperform their opponents’ fear-based messages. [...] The ACLU and its partners challenged numerous Trump anti-asylum policies, pressing these legal claims and more. Courts held many of the policies illegal, and some were suspended or never went into effect. Further attempts to eviscerate the asylum system will also be vulnerable to legal challenge.\n\nAbusive border patrol tactics also run afoul of the law, including the Fourth Amendment’s search and seizure protections and its prohibition on the excessive use of force. Here too, the ACLU has repeatedly sought and obtained accountability for unlawful conduct by Customs and Border Protection, and we will expand that work, if necessary, to encompass the acts of border vigilantes as well.\n\n### Congressional Action: Threats on Asylum and the Border"

Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris now running against each other, following President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s withdrawal from the race on July 21, 2024. Trump has focused on immigration in his campaign, dedicating time at nearly every campaign stop to border issues and his plans to fix them should he win reelection. Immigration dominated every night of the 2024 Republican National Convention and was a major point of contention at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024. Now, Trump is blaming Harris for the border crisis, labeling her Biden's \"border czar\" and attacking her immigration record in political ads."

      "snippet": "The administration has falsely and harmfully equated immigration with crime and “invasion” to justify its agenda, including the deployment of more than 35,000 federal troops nationwide, in part to aid ICE operations and quell anti-ICE protests. The deployments, which have often gone against the wishes of the states’ governors, have been met repeatedly with legal challenges and court rulings against the federal government. Aggressively militarized immigration enforcement efforts undermine public safety, community trust, and civil liberties—recently resulting in the tragic killing of a Minnesota woman, Renee Good, by an ICE officer in January. These actions divert resources from state and local governments to vastly expand the federal government’s enforcement apparatus, place millions under [...] The administration is seeking to curtail the very act of immigration itself by limiting legal immigration pathways—both preventing the arrival of newcomers and stripping people lawfully in the country of status. The administration has stripped visa holders of their legal status for political speech with which they disagree, revoked temporary protected status from migrants from certain countries, and reduced refugee admissions to historic lows—with priority given to white South Africans. And in November 2025, the administration announced it would halt all asylum decisions, placing thousands in legal limbo. It has even planned to denaturalize certain U.S. citizens—setting a quota of up to 200 people per month in 2026—and sought to eliminate constitutionally protected birthright citizenship. [...] More than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the administration for its immigration policies. Federal courts have already reaffirmed the right to bond hearings for many people facing deportation; challenged the government’s position that it can indefinitely detain people it seeks to deport to a third country; and rejected the use of detention in retaliation for exercising constitutionally protected speech. They have further upheld New York State’s ban on warrantless arrests in state and local courts and barred warrantless arrests in Chicago and Washington, DC, absent a demonstration of probable cause. Many more cases remain pending. Members of Congress have also introduced legislation to protect people appearing for routine legal hearings and appointments in immigration court. Despite"

      "snippet": "Parole has successfully reduced the number of irregular border crossings by allowing safe and legal entry to people vetted and sponsored in response to recent refugee emergencies, such as the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Between December 2023 and August 2024, Border Patrol encounters with border-crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela—the four nationalities eligible for parole—dropped by 99, 98, 97, and 96 percent, respectively.\n\nBut an executive order terminates the parole programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. DHS will now seek to put people who were paroled into the US within the past two years into expedited removal. [...] An order purports to end birthright citizenship for any child born in the United States unless one parent is a US citizen or permanent resident. The orderis being challenged as unconstitutional. These children would spend the rest of their lives fearing being deported from the country of their birth and would not receive federal identity documents, which would most likely create daunting problems in accessing essential health care, nutrition programs, and school enrollment. Some children would become de facto stateless.\n\n10. Suspension of Development Aid and Humanitarian Assistance Worldwide [...] The order calls for “additional international cooperation and agreements,” citing the “safe third country” provision in US law, which the first Trump administration used to conclude agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to deport to any of these three countries nationals from the other two. The US is now deporting and transporting nationals of Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan to Costa Rica and to Darién, Panama for their onward deportation, paid for by the US government.\n\n9.

      "snippet": "THOMAS, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which GORSUCH, J., joined. [...] As the States see it, their harms—financial injuries and the administrative burdens flowing from citizen-dependent benefits programs—cannot be remedied without a blanket ban on the enforcement of the Executive Order. See, e.g., id., at 9–11. Children often move across state lines or are born outside their parents’ State of residence. Id., at 31, 35. Given the cross-border flow, the States say, a “patchwork injunction” would prove unworkable, because it would re­ quire them to track and verify the immigration status of the parents of every child, along with the birth State of every child for whom they provide certain federally funded bene­ fits. Ibid. The Government—unsurprisingly—sees matters differ­ ently. It retorts that even if the injunction is designed to benefit only the States, it [...] and across administrations, the So­ licitor General has asked us to consider the propriety of this expansive remedy. See, e.g., Application for Stay of Injunc­ tion in McHenry v. Texas Top Cop Shop, Inc., O. T. 2024, No. 24A653 (Biden administration); Brief for Petitioners in Trump v. Hawaii, O. T. 2017, No. 17–965 (first Trump ad­ ministration)."
