The erasure of Black and Hispanic/(Afro-)Latin students’ cultural identities, histories, and ways of knowing has been embedded within the education system, creating barriers to engagement, achievement, and self-perception. The Eurocentric foundation of science curricula further amplifies this exclusion, sending implicit and explicit messages that certain forms of knowledge, storytelling, and inquiry are more legitimate than others. This course [...] Rhee, J. E., & Subedi, B. (2014). Colonizing and decolonizing projects of re/covering spirituality. Educational Studies, 50(4), 339-356.\nSmith, L. T. (2013). Decolonizing methodologies: Research and indigenous peoples.

By analyzing both theoretical frameworks and lived experiences, it offers actionable insights for strengthening authentic youth-adult collaboration."
