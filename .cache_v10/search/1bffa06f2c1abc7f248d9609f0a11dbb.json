Ha is interested in how different sensory modalities shape behaviors and plans to pursue a Ph.D. degree. Outside the lab, Ha works with the Center for Teaching and Learning and the Strategic Learning Center to help improve the teaching and learning on campus. In his free time, you would find him taking photographs or biking along the Norwottuck Rail Trail, trying out new coffee recipes, or jamming with friends with his cajon. Learn more about him here: \n\n#### Shirley Fu '26 [...] #### Allie Platt '26\n\n'26 Neuroscience Thesis Student  \n Allie Platt (she/her) is a senior from Brooklyn, New York. She is majoring in neuroscience on the pre-med track. Outside the lab, she is co-founder and co-president of the figure skating club, an EMT on ACEMS, and a Peer Educator. In her free time, she loves to listen to music (tune in to Hyperfixstation on WAMH), explore a new coffee shop, and travel.\n\n#### Ha Dong '26 [...] Current research in the Trapani lab continues to try to understand how external sensory stimuli are transformed into meaningful neuronal information. Joe is also committed to addressing issues of access, equity, and inclusion in STEM.\n\nemail Joe   \n Amherst Faculty Page   \n Facebook   \n Lab ZFin Page"

      "snippet": "Faculty across disciplines hire current Amherst students to work closely with them on original research. Students conduct literature searches, do archival work, pull together information or materials needed to develop new courses, and record and analyze data from experiments or surveys.\n\nEconomics: Students assisted Professor Caroline Theoharides (above) in analyzing data from a large randomized control trial that she ran in the Philippines to examine whether perceptions of child labor changed in response to an experiment.\n\nComputer Science: Professor Tanya Leise’s students extended applications developed by an earlier group of students, to develop a user-friendly interface and robust code for uploading a wide variety of data file formats. [...] The program also supports student research during the academic year, including travel support for honors thesis work and scientific research. Additional funds (the Alpha Delta Phi Fund and the David P. Patchel Memorial Fund) support senior projects in the humanities and social sciences, including senior essay writing, production projects and other comparable independent projects in literary studies, creative writing, theater and dance, or film.\n\nLearn more about the Gregory S. Call Undergraduate Research Program »\n\nAcademic interns assist faculty members with their research both during the summer and during the academic year. [...] A lot of the times when I’m meeting with my professor, we don’t know what the next step is. We’re working together to ask, ‘Alright, what’s been done before? And what can we do now?’ So it’s cutting-edge thinking … it’s learning how to ask the next questions that nobody’s really asked before, instead of learning from a syllabus.”   \n— Eric Jung ’21, biology major\n\n## Research Opportunities\n\nAmherst offers a broad array of research programs across STEM fields, social sciences, and the humanities. Browse our many opportunities below.\n\nThe Summer Science Undergraduate Research Fellows (SURF) program provides opportunities for Amherst College students to immerse themselves in hands-on, collaborative science research projects over the summer."
