[...] This collaborative Website provides links to comprehensive funding opportunity databases, to some of the most commonly sought funding agencies and grant competitions, and also provides advice on proposal writing. The Website also includes a guide to research for undergraduates, and information on College's policies concerning external and internal grant applications.\n\nThe Associate Dean of the Faculty, Jack Cheney can also provide constructive comments on draft grant proposals given a reasonable amount of notice, and can offer advice on putting together your project budget.\n\nAmherst College  \nAmherst, MA 01002\n\n## Contact Info\n\n## Social Links\n\n## More Navigation\n\n## Gateways\n\n## Directories\n\n## Tools & Resources"
