[...] What do you prioritize on a job candidate resume? Prior selling experience or a formal sales education? Our research examines the effects of both on newly hired salespeople's performance trajectories over time, along with the impact of manager coaching behaviors. Our results provide insights into the benefits and drawbacks of each hiring heuristic along with recommendations for how to coach new salespeople depending on which heuristic led to their hire.\n\nManagement\n\nApplying Adaptive Selling Techniques: Exploring How\n\nAlavi, Sascha; Habel, Johannes; Linsenmayer, Kim"
