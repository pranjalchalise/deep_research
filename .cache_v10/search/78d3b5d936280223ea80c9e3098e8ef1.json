      "snippet": "Pranjal has contributed to the Blind Community by developing Drishti Nepal (an open-source cross-platform mobile application.) There are about 95,000 visually impaired individuals in Nepal (2011 census). This figure has escalated over the years, which truly validates a need for some kind of solution to the daily challenges visually impaired people face due to their impediment. One such prominent area is their inability to participate in the economy through financial transactions. So, to assist visually impaired individuals to recognize various currency bills and execute daily cash transactions efficiently reducing skepticism, his team came up with the idea of “Drishti Nepal.” Today, he is leading as the Lead App Developer. [...] Apart from that, he is currently conveying the role of President at Computer Science Initiatives in Nepal, and Research Mentor at Students Research Council Nepal (SRCN). He has been working as a Co-mentor of a tech-project to uplift the travel experience of tourists and at the same time support local businesses of Nepal, at Incubate Nepal. He is recognized as one of the brightest high school students (One of 20 selected students from all disciplines and one of 10 for Computer Science) from all over Nepal to work on open-end research projects under the mentorship of MIT and Harvard graduates. Currently, He is also working on a research paper on the topic “Blockchain Technology, Smart Contracts and its application in Nepal’s securities.”\n\n#### Future Plans! [...] He has created Drishti Nepal, Kishan Nepal, Surakshya Nepal, and Educational Applications through the medium of technology that has been able to aid the adversities of disadvantaged groups and brought them to a common frontier. So, the Technopreneur sector for him is something that flows candidly. It is his passion, and he follows his passion. Mr. Chalise is generating ripple effects in the lives of students, farmers, organizations, differently-abled individuals, women, and gender equality by developing mobile applications."

Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team\nDrishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver\nripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled\npeople, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together\nto create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness\ncountless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\nAnupa Khanal\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda (2020) [...] Aayusha Dhungana\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad (2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\nPranjal Chalise\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti (2020) [...] ## Testimonials\n\nBinita Dhakal small photo\nBikash Agrawal small photo\nP Aryan Yadav small photo\nAbhishek Karna small photo\nKripa Lamichhane small photo\nRaghav Raj Sah small photo\nRiya Jha small photo\nAyusha Shrestha small photo\nKritika Pandit small photo\nSatyam Adhikari small photo\nSanskriti Giri small photo\nAayusha Dhungana small photo\nPranjal Chalise small photo\nAnupa Khanal small photo\nAarasi Shrestha small photo\nMahesh Yadav small photo\nAayushka Budhathoki small photo\nKiran Yojan small photo\nBenju Baral small photo\nShruti Pokhrel small photo\nShrijan Pandey small photo\nBinita Dhakal\n\n## Binita Dhakal\n\nTeam Dravya (2021)"
