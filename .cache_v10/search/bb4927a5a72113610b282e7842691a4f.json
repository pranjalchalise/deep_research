This would provide local companies with access to a pipeline of qualified candidates to hire upon graduation. Also, T10 reported, “I feel that due to the pandemic, indicators will lag for several years. They should consider staggered goals.”"

Career Development reaches out regularly to students to provide advice and support and by way of Career Fairs, classroom presentations, and career coaching at the individual student level. We anticipate greater success in placing students in internships if the action plan proposal for an additional cost-shared Career Services position is approved.
