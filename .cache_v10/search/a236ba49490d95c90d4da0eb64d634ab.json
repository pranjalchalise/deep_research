The way in which you market your agents, though, can impact their relationship formation with clients and, ultimately, the success of your firm.\n\nManagement, Marketing and Sales\n\nCreating Customer Engagement on Social Media\n\nde Oliveira Santini, Fernando; Junior Ladeira, Wagner; Costa Pinto, Diego; Maurer Herter, Márcia; Hoffmann Sampaio, Claudio; Babin, Barry J. [...] Insider\n\nINSIDER: The Adaptation Advantage\n\nKoehler, Kristen\n\nRobots will eventually take your job! Truth is, they may indeed take it one day, but they also may help guide you into your next position.

Some situations require minimal decision-making effort, while others require more thought and effort to reach a decision. Our research finds that there are two situations, driven by a motivation to achieve cognitive closure, in which people will put more effort into the decision-making process in order to simplify the process in the future.\n\nMarketing and Sales, Customer Relations\n\nThe Power of a Feminine Brand Name"
