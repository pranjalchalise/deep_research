      "snippet": "Dr. Dong has been actively conducting basic and applied research in the field of aquatic animal health since 2007. His research has centered on the discovery and characterization of aquatic pathogens, particularly infectious and emerging infectious diseases of economically important aquaculture species in Asia. His research group has investigated and developed detection methods for a number of emerging pathogens in tilapia, Asian sea bass, and whiteleg shrimp. He's also working on fish vaccine development and other disease-control strategies, such as nanobubble technology, and immunostimulants. He has authored over 75 international peer-reviewed articles related to this field.\n\nSelected news links: [...] Skip to main content\n\n# Dr Ha Thanh Dong\n\nDr. Dong currently works at the Asian Institute of Technology.

      "snippet": "To discover the relationship between the number of layers, the kernel size, and the complexity level of the tasks, we picked and summarized several typical studies in Table 2. A majority of the CNNs consist of five to nine layers [23,63,64,113,114,165,166,167,168], usually including two to three convolutional layers, two to three max-pooling layers, followed by one to two fully connected layers before feeding the feature representation into the output layer (softmax layer in most cases). Dong et al.  demonstrated performance improvements by leveraging both handcrafted time and frequency domain features along with features generated from a CNN, called HAR-Net, to classify six locomotion activities using accelerometer and gyroscope signals from a smartphone. Ravi et al.  used a shallow"
