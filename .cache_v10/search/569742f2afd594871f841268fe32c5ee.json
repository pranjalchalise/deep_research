However, this progress is threatened by climate change, which unleashes a slew of issues like carbon dioxide (CO2) increases, frequent droughts, and temperature shifts that present a substantial obstacle to crop yields and food security. The ramifications of these climatic factors on insect pest biology and ecology are profound, given that these pests depend heavily on these factors. Since crop productivity is tightly connected to both insect pests and these climate variables, changes in these factors can significantly impact crop yields. Therefore, it is imperative to comprehend the impact of climate change on insect pests to manage them effectively and [...] change on insect pests to manage them effectively and ensure sufficient food production. This review examines the climate change effect on insect pest biology and ecology and explores the potential use of modern pest monitoring technologies and prediction tools to devise effective pest management strategies to improve crop production and food security."
