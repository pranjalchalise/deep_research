I will always will appreciate the leadership academy the rest of my life!! [...] As 2025 comes to a close, I find myself reflecting with deep gratitude on my time at Amherst College and all that we have built together.\nAt the start of the year, I was challenged to embark on a journey to design and launch a leadership academy—one that would bring together some of the world’s brightest students in a cohort experience focused on intentional leadership development. What followed was a process that felt both fast and slow: fast in momentum, and slow in the care we took to listen, learn, and build with purpose.\nBy centering the voices of students, faculty, and staff, we created the Mammoth Leadership Academy. As 2025 ends, I’m proud to share that we have graduated 60 students from the program."
