      "snippet": "skip to that module because you don't even know that it exists in the first place. But of course, usually when I start out, I always like to do my initial research on YouTube instead of jumping right into a paid course. It's better to at least get your feet wet there, and then you can progress to a more advanced level of courses after you've decided that this is the language for you. So, going into the actual courses on YouTube that I've seen, one of the most notable YouTubers that have great Python learning resources are Programming with Mosh. I think I've talked about him on this channel before, but he literally puts fulllength courses out there. Like he literally just put a two hours beginner course out there two months ago and he has a playlist of really valuable information on his [...] to learn Python. So, let's get into it. So, to me, the most obvious place to learn a new skill is always YouTube. I mean, it's free, you can learn at your own pace, and you can basically cherrypick the types of things that you want to learn. But here's the problem. You don't get any sort of credibility or certificate from learning that way. Sure, you might gain the skills needed, but you're not really able to put that on your resume with any sort of credibility. The other problem is also the solution that I mentioned earlier, which is the cherry-picking part. If you're learning Python for the first time, for example, you might not know what you don't know. So, if you want to skip to data structures or functions, well, maybe you can't skip to that module because you don't even know that it [...] finishing the section and understanding the material before going on to the next module. So I think this part is especially valuable if you're a beginner. Another cool aspect about Code Academy is that it's self-paced and they have thousands of reviews from other students, meaning that you can kind of count on the material being pretty decent. I won't say too much more about them because I have videos in the past that talk about them, but I would definitely recommend checking them out. It's very well put together. Now, the only problem is variability. There's not a ton of variety or a ton of selection. It is just like basic Python. It's not going to have a ton of different options for you to learn Python with specific libraries or like different templates or frameworks. So, just keep that"
