Recommendation systems [...] ### 1. Recommendation systems\n\nRecommendation engines are one of the most popular uses of machine learning, as product recommendations are featured on most e-commerce websites. Using machine learning models, websites track your behavior to recognize patterns in your browsing history, previous purchases, and shopping cart activity. This data collection is used for pattern recognition to predict user preferences.\n\nCompanies like Spotify and Netflix use similar machine learning algorithms to recommend music or TV shows based on your previous listening and viewing history. Over time and with training, these algorithms aim to understand your preferences to accurately predict which artists or films you may enjoy.\n\n### 2. Social media connections"

As more organizations and people rely on machine learning models to manage growing volumes of data, instances of machine learning are occurring in front of and around us daily—whether we notice or not. What’s exciting to see is how it’s improving our quality of life, supporting quicker and more effective execution of some business operations and industries, and uncovering patterns that humans are likely to miss. Here are examples of machine learning at work in our daily life that provide value in many ways—some large and some small. [...] family practitioners or internists when treating patients bedside because data trends will predict health risks like heart disease. As an example, wearables generate mass amounts of data on the wearer’s health and many use AI and machine learning to alert them or their doctors of issues to support preventative measures and respond to emergencies. [...] ## 1. Facial recognition\n\nFacial recognition is one of the more obvious applications of machine learning. People previously received name suggestions for their mobile photos and Facebook tagging, but now someone is immediately tagged and verified by comparing and analyzing patterns through facial contours. And facial recognition paired with deep learning has become highly useful in healthcare to help detect genetic diseases or track a patient’s use of medication more accurately. It’s also used to combat important social issues such as child sex trafficking or sexual exploitation of children. The list of applications and industries influenced by it is steadily on the rise.\n\n## 2. Product recommendations"

But the capabilities of Google Maps were not even possible until a few years ago. This application uses two main factors in its favor that no other organization has: a large amount of information from its users and Google's development of their Machine Learning platforms with cutting-edge technology.\n\n### \n\n### How does Google use Machine Learning?\n\nTo accurately predict future traffic, Google Maps uses Machine Learning to combine live traffic conditions with historical traffic patterns on roads around the world. This allows it to show specific information to its users about the estimated time of a route and the real-time traffic to get there.\n\n## \n\n## Machine Learning Example #2 [...] ## Machine Learning Example #4\n\nMarketing is one of the industries that has been transformed in the last decade thanks to Machine Learning.\n\nThe tools that Meta (formerly Facebook) has developed for businesses on its social media platforms in recent years have revolutionized digital advertising campaigns. From measuring the results of a campaign in real-time to recommending audience segments that could be interested in specific products or services, this company changed Internet advertising thanks to Machine Learning. However, they have been criticized for their privacy policies in recent years.\n\n### \n\n### How does Meta use Machine Learning? [...] - NLP: Based on neurolinguistic programming, information can be identified with tags within each song or playlist that users create. In this way, Spotify can better understand why people are interested in certain songs or genres.\n\n- Audio modeling: This type of ML algorithm explores the song's content and compares it with other songs to identify categories. For example, if a song has a particular rhythm or certain instrumentalization, it will be categorized within playlists of similar genres and tunes.\n\n## \n\n## Machine Learning Example #6"
