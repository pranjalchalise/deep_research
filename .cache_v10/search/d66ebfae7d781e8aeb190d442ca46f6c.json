      "snippet": "Still, overall deportations remained well below the stated goal of 1 million per year and even below the number during Joe Biden’s final year as president. However, limited data releases by the Trump administration make it difficult to compare the records. In December, ICE stated DHS had “removed” 622,000 noncitizens under Trump, whereas the Biden administration carried out 778,000 total repatriations in fiscal year (FY) 2024, including noncitizens denied entry at airports and U.S. borders. It appears that DHS’s count includes both removals from within U.S. communities and returns of individuals who crossed the border without authorization. Unlike in prior administrations, DHS has not publicly broken down the number of removals and returns under Trump or detailed the number of [...] On his first day in office, Trump suspended refugee resettlement, although the administration later resettled a small number of White South Africans. Only 506 refugees were resettled from February to October, 342 of them from South Africa, compared to just over 100,000 resettlements in FY 2024. The ceiling for resettlement in FY 2026 was set at a record-low 7,500, and just 720 refugees were resettled from October through December 2025 (see Figure 3). The commensurate slashing of refugee funding has resulted in refugee-serving organizations across the country closing and leaving many refugees with little support. In June, the State Department reallocated $250 million originally intended for resettled refugees to support DHS’s self-deportation program."

      "snippet": "As the 2024 election approaches, immigration remains a central issue. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have presented markedly different approaches to immigration and its value to the United States. Voters will have an opportunity to study each candidate’s views and decide our nation’s approach to immigration policy for the foreseeable future. In his previous term as president, Trump pursued policies limiting legal immigration, diminishing humanitarian protections, and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. As vice president in the Biden-Harris administration, Harris’ work focused on leading the administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In this role, she pursued public- and [...] In June 2024, in what would be a different approach from efforts to limit student visas during his administration, Trump called for providing green cards to all graduating international students.\nHARRIS: YES Harris argues that legal immigrants are part of “the fabric of America.” The Biden-Harris administration has largely restored legal immigration channels to the U.S., including by issuing a final rule that reversed a number of the Trump administration’s restrictions. The Biden-Harris administration’s immigration legislative framework would aim to eliminate employment-based visa backlogs, recapture unused visas, reduce lengthy wait times, and eliminate per-country visa caps, all of which would increase legal immigration to the U.S. THE FUTURE OF U.S. IMMIGRATION: 8. [...] HARRIS: MIXED The Biden-Harris administration has implemented policies that dramatically limit the right to asylum at the U.S. southern border, while at the same time expanding orderly pathways to come to the U.S. The administration released an interim final rule, “Securing the Border,” on June 4, 2024, that significantly restricts access to the right to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The rule was released alongside the presidential proclamation that “shuts down” the U.S. southern border and is in effect unless migrant crossings substantially decline over a prolonged period. Under the interim final rule, when the presidential proclamation’s suspension of entry is in place, most people who ask for protection will be disqualified from asylum — whether they have crossed the border"

      "snippet": "Such differences in immigration levels would directly impact economic growth. Harris’s policies could expand the labor force and boost GDP, while Trump’s measures could reduce GDP growth by as much as half a percentage point in 2025 alone—equivalent to about $130 billion. A Peterson Institute study warns that mass deportations under Trump’s plan would create inflationary pressures by shrinking the labor supply, driving up the cost of goods and services by several percentage points annually throughout his second term. [...] As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, immigration remains a central theme. Former President Donald Trump advocates for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, restricting entry for refugees and asylum seekers, reinstating the Remain in Mexico program, expanding the border wall, and reducing worker visas. He also proposes banning entry from Muslim-majority countries and ending DACA protections, which offers protection from deportation and a work permit, requiring renewal every two years, as a path to citizenship for individuals who were under 16 when they were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents before June 15, 2012. [...] ### The economic impact of the candidates' proposals\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll from October 2024, 21% of Americans view immigration as the most pressing non-economic concern. A joint study by Brookings, AEI, and the Niskanen Center analyzed high- and low-immigration scenarios under each candidate’s plan and found that net immigration would be far higher under Harris’s policies, with a forecasted net migration of 3.7 million in 2025 vs. Trump’s forecasted net migration of 740,000."

      "snippet": "Recent simulations using the Gallup World Polls show that a second Trump mandate will largely affect migration intentions. Focusing on Mexican migrants – whose 99% prospective migrants designate the USA as their intended destination – Beine et al., 2024, evaluate that in case of a second mandate replicating the, 2016, one in terms of immigration policies, the number of Mexicans desiring to immigrate to the US would decrease by 1.2 million. Should the policy be more stringent and include a complete closure of the border, then the decrease would reach 8, 6 million, with most people deciding to stay in Mexico, and some who would switch to other destinations such as Canada, Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. For instance, in the first scenario, the Mexican migration pressure [...] 1. INTRODUCTION During his, 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump pledged to reduce immigration and implement large-scale deportations. Alongside his supporters and advisors, various strategies to achieve this goal have been discussed and documented, providing a clear outline of the policies that could be expected during his second term. In the following, we highlight the main potential policy changes that could dramatically impact US immigration (DePillis and Smialek, 2024; Pillai and Artiga, 2024; Esterline, 2024; McKibbin et al., 2024): 2.

In other words, this is equivalent to a scenario of no growth during the Trump mandate. Additionally, inflation would go up by 3.5 percent –assuming the FED reacts – and the federal government would lose more than $860 billion in revenue over 10 years (Edwards and Ortega, 2016, ; Gitis and Collins, 2015; Lynch and Ettlinger, 2024; McKibbin et al., 2024; Wolgin, 2015). In comparison, evaluations of the economic impact of a strong protectionist policy with a 10% rise in tariffs toward all countries, a 60% one toward China and Chinese reprisals conclude only to a fall in US GDP by 1.3% (Bouët et al., 2024). This highlights that the US economy is significantly more dependent on foreign workers than on foreign imports."
