It's able to learn over time by using human-in-the-loop to assist with memory generation. I just released a video which takes a deep dive into its architecture, and why its useful:  See the open source repo here: \n\n157   6 Comments\n\nLike   Comment\n\nMatthew Schwab   7mo \n\n Report this comment [...] Matthew Schwab   7mo \n\n Report this comment\n\nThis looks like a promising tool for streamlining approval processes. How does LLManager's memory agent tackle more complex decision-making scenarios?
