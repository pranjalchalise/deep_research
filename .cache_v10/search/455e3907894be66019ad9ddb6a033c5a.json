      "snippet": "“My volunteerism reminds me to emphasize and prioritize the voices of young people as much as we can in the work we do,” says Sushmita Subedi, a senior researcher in the education systems area. “Youth have a lot more to give to policy and decision-making in education than we give them credit and space for.” Subedi supports Samaanta Foundation, a nonprofit providing quality higher education opportunities to students from marginalized communities in Nepal. She helps the organization develop systems for measurement and evaluation, and mentors program fellows and alumni.\n\nImage [...] Blog post\n\n# The Power of Volunteerism: Bridging Divides, Bringing New Perspectives to Our Work\n\nIn 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy prescribed volunteerism as a vital avenue for strengthening social connections in response to what he called an “epidemic of loneliness and isolation,” particularly coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.Also in 2023, the AIR Champions for Change initiative launched, designed to recognize staff who bring our institution’s values to life through volunteering. As part of this effort, AIR donates to the eligible, mission-aligned nonprofits where our staff volunteer, deepening the impact of their efforts. [...] As careers evolve, volunteerism can provide a touchpoint to the people and communities that sparked staffs’ research interests. “I previously taught middle grades on the west side of Chicago and I currently live there,” says Senior Researcher Jennie Jiang, a volunteer with Chicago-based BUILD, a positive youth development organization and one of AIR’s Partners for Progress. “My work at AIR often focuses on the systematic issues at a larger scale and often I am working with large datasets or trying to understand patterns across districts, schools or states. My volunteer work grounds me in the community and people.”"
