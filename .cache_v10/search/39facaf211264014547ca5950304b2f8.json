Elevvo Pathways 🔍 Key Highlights ✅ User-Based Collaborative Filtering (recommendations from similar users) ✅ Evaluation using Precision@5 ✅ Data visualizations for insights 🔥 Bonus Implementations ✨ Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (movie-to-movie similarity) ✨ Matrix Factorization (SVD) to capture hidden patterns 💡 This project strengthened my skills in: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn Similarity-based modeling & recommendation systems Data visualization and model evaluation Here’s a quick glimpse of the results: 🎥 Different methods recommend different [...] 💯 Day 16 / 100 – 100 Days of #LeetCode Challenge 🔍 Problem: Implement strStr() Goal: Return the index of the first occurrence of the substring needle inside haystack. If needle is not found, return -1. My Approach (Manual Sliding Window): First, check if needle is even present—if not, return -1 immediately. Loop through each position i of haystack. For each position, compare the slice haystack[i : i + len(needle)] with needle. If they match, return the current index i. Complexity: ⏱ Time: O((n − m + 1) \\ m) – n = length of haystack, m = length of needle. 🗂 Space: O(1) – only variables for indexing are used. Key Takeaways: A simple sliding window solution is easy to understand and sufficient for most inputs. For very large strings, advanced algorithms like KMP can reduce worst-case time."
