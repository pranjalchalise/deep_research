There is no strict logic that says all must go through each and every transitioning layer. The names of each level are given to uniquely identify the separate tracks.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what an organisation calls its leadership levels, as long as each level has clear and unique responsibilities and expectations it helps in transitioning between jobs.

      "snippet": "### Early career\n\n[edit]\n\nLittle is known about Johnson's life between the end of 1729 and 1731. It is likely that he lived with his parents. He experienced bouts of mental anguish and physical pain during years of illness; his tics and gesticulations associated with Tourette syndrome became more noticeable and were often commented upon. By 1731 Johnson's father was deeply in debt and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield. Johnson hoped to obtain the position of a school usher, which became available at Stourbridge Grammar School, but since he did not have a degree, his application was passed over on 6 September 1731.

There he became a close friend of Cornelius Ford, who employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school. Ford was a successful, well-connected academic, and notorious alcoholic whose excesses contributed to his death six years later. After spending six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Hunter, the headmaster, \"angered by the impertinence of this long absence\", refused to allow Johnson to continue at the school. Unable to return to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson enrolled at the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge. As the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able to spend more time with the Fords, and he began to"
