Competing on-site against 105 teams from universities across New England and five Canadian provinces, our team took 1st place among undergraduate institutions and 16th place overall, solving 8 out of 13 problems. A huge thank you to the organizers and sponsors for making this event possible, as well as to the Amherst CS department for their invaluable support. Special shoutout to Jane Street for the Robert Frost inspired t-shirt!\n\n38   7 Comments\n\nLike   Comment\n\nLiam Davis   1y \n\n Report this comment [...] View Profile   Connect\n\n## Explore content categories\n\n Career\n Productivity\n Finance\n Soft Skills & Emotional Intelligence\n Project Management\n Education\n Technology\n Leadership\n Ecommerce\n User Experience\n\n## Sign in to view more content\n\nCreate your free account or sign in to continue your search\n\n## Welcome back\n\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.\n\nNew to LinkedIn?
