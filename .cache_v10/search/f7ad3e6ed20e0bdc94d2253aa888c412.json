      "snippet": "Regarding machine learning, Dong collaborates with faculty on research projects to produce models and supply consulting services. From advising faculty on the most effective ML tools to use or co-developing solutions, his efforts serve to merge data science and practical applications in the academic environment. “Some of the projects come from professors, so we work together with them to develop different models,” he said. “Sometimes it’s just providing consulting services. For example, they are unsure which model to use or how to build a model, so we have discussions with them and sometimes even code together.” [...] Dong stresses the critical function OIT serves in supporting the campus, from faculty and staff to students. “OIT is supporting the whole university, and that’s quite amazing,” he said. “We have different parts to support different functions across the university.” When asked what the future of IT looked like on campus, he expressed a desire for the continued enhancement of education through new tools and research collaboration. “The priority is definitely to keep supporting the UA community,” he said. “At the same time, keeping pace with new technology is also important.” [...] Hao Dong recently joined The University of Alabama in February 2024 and has since served a crucial role in promoting ML and GIS technologies through OIT. His path to the IT field began with an interest in mathematics, a foundation that sparked a curiosity toward programming. While in graduate school, he studied engineering and planning, through which he discovered a passion for automating processes via coding. “When I had the opportunity to do some programming to either speed up the process or automate some process, I enjoyed doing it,” he explained. This interest shifted into expertise, leading Dong to his career in IT, where he now generates machine learning models and manages GIS systems."
