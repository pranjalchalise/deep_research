      "snippet": "Preface 1 Introduction to Python Programming is an interactive offering that teaches basic programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and the Python language using hands-on activities. The resource includes a unique, integrated code runner , through which students can immediately apply what they learn to check their understanding. Embedded videos, critical thinking exercises, and explorations of external programming tools and activities all contribute to a meaningful and supportive learning experience. [...] About Introduction to Python Programming Introduction to Python Programming provides a comprehensive foundation in programming concepts and skills, and is aligned to the scope of most introductory courses. A wide array of scenarios, contexts, and problems reflect programming applications in many disciplines and careers. The offering is suitable for a diverse learner audience, including those pursuing computer science, business, science, social science, statistics, data science, and related areas of study and employment. [...] Pedagogical Foundation Concise text and video-based animations Introduction to Python Programming is designed to foster active learning and student engagement. It focuses on interactivity and practice through its integrated code runner , videos, and links to external environments and activities. With that focus, the material is often more concise, with less text and more activity.\nEach section's content is organized in subsections. The subsection begins with a concise introduction to the concept, with key term definitions and brief context for its relevance and importance. The concept is then explained in detail using video-based animations and interactive learning questions."

      "snippet": "## There are 4 modules in this course\n\nThis course provides an introduction to programming and the Python language. Students are introduced to core programming concepts like data structures, conditionals, loops, variables, and functions. This course includes an overview of the various tools available for writing and running Python, and gets students coding quickly. It also provides hands-on coding exercises using commonly used data structures, writing custom functions, and reading and writing to files. This course may be more robust than some other introductory python courses, as it delves deeper into certain essential programming topics. [...] This first module covers an intro to programming and the Python language. We’ll start by downloading and installing the necessary tools to begin programming and writing code in Python. After learning how to print to the console, we’ll get an understanding of Python’s basic data types, and how to do simple math. We’ll follow up by creating our first Python script, and learn how to define and assign variables, while controlling the flow of our program using conditionals. We’ll also learn how to get input from the user, including some very basic error checking.

It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n\nIt is used for:\n\n web development (server-side),\n software development,\n mathematics,\n system scripting.\n\n### What can Python do?\n\n Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n\n## Why Python? [...] ### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n\n Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n\n### Example\n\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nTry it Yourself »\n\n## Video: Python Introduction\n\n❮ Previous Next ❯\n\n★ +1\n\nSign in to track progress\n\n#### COLOR PICKER\n\nREMOVE ADS\n\nGET CERTIFIED\n\nFOR TEACHERS\n\nCONTACT US; \"Contact us about sales or errors\")\n\n×\n\n## Contact Sales [...] ## Why Python?\n\n Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n\n### Good to know"

It is commonly used for web development, data analysis, automation and machine learning. This article covers the basic concepts of Python to help beginners start coding.\n\nTo begin, install Python on your system from the official Python website.\n\n## First Python Program\n\nOnce installed, we can write and execute Python code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Vs Code (requires installing Python extension) etc.\n\n````\nprint(\"Hello Geeks, Welcome to Python Basics\")\n\n````\n\nExplanation:print() is a built-in function that outputs text or variables to the console. In this case, it displays the string \"Hello, Geeks! Welcome to Python Basics\". [...] 1. Input: The input() function is used to take input from the user. By default, the value entered by the user is stored as a string.\n\n````\nval = input(\"Enter your value: \")\nprint(\"You entered:\", val)\n\n````\n\nOutput\n\nEnter your value: 11  \nYou entered: 11\n\nIf you need the input in another data type (such as int or float), you must convert it explicitly.\n\n````\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\nage = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n\nprint(type(name))\nprint(type(age))\n\n````\n\nOutput\n\nEnter your name: Jake  \nEnter your age: 12  \n<class 'str'>  \n<class 'int'>\n\nExplanation:\n\n2. Output: The print() function is used to display values or messages.\n\n````\nprint \"Hello, Geek!\"\n\n````\n\n## Python Operators"
