Random down-sampled lexicase selection evaluates individuals on only a random subset of the training cases, allowing for more individuals to be explored with the same number of program executions. However, sampling randomly can exclude important cases from the down-sample for a number of generations, while cases that measure the same behavior (synonymous cases) may be overused. In this work, we introduce Informed Down-Sampled Lexicase Selection. This method leverages population statistics to build down-samples that contain more distinct and therefore informative training cases. Through an empirical investigation across two different GP systems [...] Ryan Bahlous-Boldi\n\n·\n\nLi Ding\n\n·\n\nLee Spector\n\n> ... To evaluate and select individuals during evolution, we employ a down-sampled selection strategy, where a subset of test cases is sampled without replacement from the training set at each generation . Specifically, although the dataset contains 1000 input-output pairs, only 50 training cases are randomly selected at the start of each generation and used for fitness evaluation. This approach ensures diverse assessments across generations, preventing overfitting to a fixed subset of test cases while maintaining time efficiency. ...\n>\n> Reference:\n>\n> Exploring the Effect of Genetic Improvement for Large Language Models-Generated Code\n\nA Comprehensive Analysis of Down-sampling for Genetic Programming-based Program Synthesis"

One example is work by Punch and Rand combining genetic programming with elements from Holland’s Echo architecture and Brooks’s subsumption architecture (Punch and Rand, 2000). Another example is my work on evolution within spatially continuous 3d virtual worlds (Spector and Klein, 2003). In such en-vironments, many other biological concepts that had previously played little or no role in genetic and evolutionary computation also come into play. For example, in many ALife-derived systems diﬀerent individuals have diﬀerent life expectancies, and their reproductive behaviors may change based on age and [...] Chapter 2 AN ESSAY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF GENETIC PROGRAMMING Lee Spector Cognitive Science Hampshire College Amherst, MA 01002 USA lspector@hampshire.edu Abstract This chapter presents a personal perspective on the relation between theory and practice in genetic programming. It posits that genetic pro-gramming practice (including both applications and technique enhance-ments) is moving toward biology and that it should continue to do so."
