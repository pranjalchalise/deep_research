      "snippet": "Deborah Berke (born 1954) is an American architect and academic. She is the founder of TenBerke, formerly Deborah Berke Partners, a New York City-based architectural design firm. Berke is currently Dean and J.M. Hoppin Professor at the Yale School of Architecture, where she began teaching as an associate professor in 1987. At the time of her appointment in 2016, Berke became the first woman Dean of the school. In 2022, Deborah received the AIA/ACSA Topaz Medallion for Excellence in Architectural Education. She was awarded the 2025 AIA Gold Medal Award.\n\n## Life\n\n[edit] [...] ## Life\n\n[edit]\n\nDeborah Berke was born in 1954 in Manhattan, New York City, and raised in Douglaston, Queens. She traces her decision to become an architect to age 14, when she would explore Queens and study the borough's small-lot houses. Berke attended the Rhode Island School of Design, earning a BFA in 1975 and a BArch in 1977. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the school in 2005.\n\nFor graduate studies, Berke attended the City College of New York, earning a Masters in Urban Planning in Urban Design in 1984.\n\nIn 2012, she became the first laureate of the Berkeley-Rupp Architecture Professorship and Prize.\n\nIn 2024, she was awarded the 2025 AIA Gold Medal Award.\n\n## Selected works\n\n[edit] [...] American architect and academic\n\n| Deborah Berke |\n\n| Berke in 2018 |\n| Born | 1954 (age 71–72)  New York City, US |\n| Alma mater |  Rhode Island School of Design  City College of New York |\n| Occupation | Architect |\n| Awards | 2012 Berkeley-Rupp Architecture Professorship and Prize; 2025 AIA Gold Medal |\n| Practice | TenBerke  Yale School of Architecture |\n|  |"

      "snippet": "Then I feel like I worked and worked and worked, and built a practice, and tried to weave together my academic life of teaching at Yale with my professional life of getting joy from making and creating. Eventually, late in my life I got married and had a child, but before that I had a very active social life [laughs]. Weaving all those things together in a meaningful way has been the majority of my career.\n\nTell me about integrating motherhood. [...] Eventually, I started working at the institute as the administrator of their educational programs, and then taught in those programs. In direct contrast and balance to the artistic training I had from RISD, the intellectual environment at the Institute was incomparable – Peter Eisenman, Tony Vidler, Ken Frampton, Mario Gandelsonas, Diana Agrest, Julia Bloomfield – Oppositions, October, exhibitions, lecture series, all this stuff going on. That played a huge part in making me the kind of person I am today in an academic leadership role.\n\nWhat did you do next? [...] Deborah is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and The City University of New York. In 2005, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design. In 2017, her firm received the National Design Award from the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. In her conversation with Julia Gamolina, Deborah speaks about finding fulfillment and meaning in all parts of her life - as mother, as architect, and as a teacher - and shares advice for new mothers, entrepreneurs, and young architects.\n\nJG: How did your interest in architecture first develop?"
