      "snippet": "and algorithms. Ongoing and fresh developments in AI/ML techniques to neuroscience, however, will eventually enable us to create medications for CNS disorders that are more efficacious. [...] AI is employed in brain imaging and diagnosis, boosting the accuracy with which neuropsychiatric diseases are identified. BBB permeability prediction is one of the most important uses of AI in drug discovery, as it improves the selection of CNS-active drugs. Additionally, AI is transforming treatment techniques for neurodevelopmental disorders and assisting in the discovery of novel antidepressant medications through data-driven methodologies. Despite these accomplishments, AI-driven drug discovery still has several constraints, such as data biases, regulatory barriers, and ethical issues. Overcoming these restrictions will be critical to unlocking AI's full potential in neuropsychiatric research. This paper concludes with several future possibilities and opportunities, such as [...] CNS medications have a greater likelihood of failing than non-CNS medications; for disease-modifying therapy, the failure rate has reached 100%."

      "snippet": "The identification of hits and the generation of viable leads is an early and yet crucial step in drug discovery. In the West, the main players of drug discovery are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, while in China, academic institutions remain central in the field of drug discovery. There has been a tremendous amount of investment from the public as well as private sectors to support infrastructure buildup and expertise consolidation relative to drug discovery and development in the past two decades. A large-scale compound library has been established in China, and a series of high-impact discoveries of lead compounds have been made by integrating information obtained from different technology-based strategies. Natural products are a major source in China’s drug discovery [...] Skip to article\n\nMy account\n\nSign in\n\n View PDF\n\n## SLAS Discovery\n\nVolume 20, Issue 3, March 2015, Pages 318-329\n\n# Review Articles Emergence of Chinese Drug Discovery Research: Impact of Hit and Lead Identification\n\nAuthor links open overlay panel, , , , ,\n\n rights and content\n\nUnder a Creative Commons license\n\nOpen access\n\n## Abstract [...] products are a major source in China’s drug discovery efforts. Knowledge has been enhanced via disruptive breakthroughs such as the discovery of Boc5 as a nonpeptidic agonist of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), one of the class B G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). Most of the original hit identification and lead generation were carried out by academic institutions, including universities and specialized research institutes. The Chinese pharmaceutical industry is gradually transforming itself from manufacturing low-end generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients to inventing new drugs."

      "snippet": "The practical implications of AI’s integration into neuroscience are vast. For instance, in brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), AI algorithms decode neural activity in real time, enabling paralyzed individuals to control external devices with their thoughts . Such systems leverage cutting-edge neural decoders, translating signals from brain regions involved in motor control into precise commands . In drug discovery, AI has streamlined the identification of therapeutic targets for neurological disorders by analyzing genetic, proteomic, and clinical data. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been particularly effective in optimizing molecular candidates, accelerating the development of treatments for conditions such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) . [...] AI has also accelerated drug discovery in neuroscience, particularly for neurodegenerative disorders. By analyzing vast molecular datasets and predicting drug–target interactions, AI systems can identify promising therapeutic candidates with unprecedented speed. In one case, an ML platform screened billions of compounds and identified a candidate drug for Alzheimer’s disease in just six months—a process that would typically take several years using conventional methods. This drug is now undergoing preclinical trials, demonstrating AI’s ability to expedite the development pipeline and address critical therapeutic gaps in neurology . [...] data. Once trained, the model is applied to the test set to generate predictions, which may represent properties or behaviors of the molecules. The results, often visualized as graphs or numerical outputs, provide valuable insights for decision-making and applications in fields such as drug discovery and materials science. This workflow exemplifies how machine learning integrates data-driven approaches with molecular analyses to deliver accurate and actionable predictions."
