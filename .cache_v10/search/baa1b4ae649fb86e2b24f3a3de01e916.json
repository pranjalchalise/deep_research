      "snippet": "### NumPy & SciPy: Mathematical Foundation\n\nWhile technically libraries rather than full frameworks, NumPy and SciPy form the computational backbone of the most used Python libraries in data science. They provide optimized numerical operations that make Python competitive with compiled languages for mathematical workloads.\n\nBusiness Value: These libraries enable complex financial modeling, scientific computing, and algorithmic work without requiring teams to drop down to lower-level languages, maintaining productivity while achieving performance.\n\nBest For: Financial modeling, scientific research applications, algorithmic trading systems, simulation, and optimization problems.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks: AI-Powered Products\n\n### TensorFlow: Enterprise Machine Learning Infrastructure [...] ### TensorFlow: Enterprise Machine Learning Infrastructure\n\nTensorFlow ranks among the most popular Python frameworks for machine learning, backed by Google's engineering resources. It provides end-to-end infrastructure for building, training, and deploying ML models at scale.\n\nBusiness Value: TensorFlow's production-readiness reduces the gap between data science experimentation and deployed products. Its model serving infrastructure (TensorFlow Serving) allows seamless deployment of ML models as APIs, reducing DevOps complexity.\n\nBest For: Computer vision applications, natural language processing systems, recommendation engines, or any project requiring production ML deployment.\n\n### PyTorch: Research to Production [...] ## Web Development Frameworks: Building Customer-Facing Applications\n\n### Django: Enterprise-Grade Full-Stack Development\n\nDjango remains one of the best Python frameworks for web development when your project requires robust, scalable infrastructure out of the box. This full-stack framework includes built-in admin panels, authentication systems, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and security features that would otherwise require months of custom development.\n\nBusiness Value: Django's \"batteries-included\" philosophy means faster MVP development and reduced vendor lock-in. Major platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and Mozilla rely on Django for handling millions of users, making it a proven choice for enterprises concerned about scalability."

      "snippet": "Scikit-learnScikit-learn is a free and open-source machine learning library built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. The library provides simple and efficient tools for predictive analysis, including model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and more. This makes Scikit ideal for building and deploying machine learning models in Python.\n PyTorchPyTorch is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library that was originally developed by Meta AI. It’s one of the most popular libraries for building and deploying deep learning models for computer vision and natural language processing use cases. Along with comprehensive built in features, PyTorch has a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries that extend its functionality. [...] Django  \n  Django is an open-source web application framework for rapidly developing secure and scalable websites and applications. The framework is often called “batteries included” because it includes everything web developers need to get started out of the box. Django is ideal for building the backend components for large-scale web applications.\n Flask  \n  Flask is a micro web framework that was designed to be lightweight and only provides the essential components necessary for web applications. The backend framework is modular and relies on extensions to add functionality, such as authentication, database integrations, and REST APIs. The flexibility and extensibility of Flask makes it suitable for a variety of web projects.\n CherryPy [...] ## Python Framework Management with Anaconda\n\nThere are many different Python libraries and frameworks for different use cases. However, handling large Python projects can become complicated without a comprehensive platform like Anaconda to streamline package management.\n\nAnaconda is a leading platform for data science and machine learning, with a robust package manager and efficient environment management capabilities. The built-in package manager called Conda makes it easy to install, update, and manage popular Python libraries and frameworks. The platform also allows users to create isolated environments, each with its own set of packages to avoid dependency conflicts."
