      "snippet": "Why use React: React is prized for its flexibility and vast ecosystem. You can start small – dropping a React component into an existing page – or build entire single-page applications with it. There’s a rich choice of libraries for routing, state management, and more (for example, React Router for navigation and Redux or context for state). Refonte Learning often recommends React to students because it’s beginner-friendly yet in high demand. The learning curve is moderate: you need to get comfortable with JSX (writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript) and concepts like state and props, but you don’t have to learn a whole new architecture as you would with Angular. Many companies (from startups to FAANG giants) use React in production, so learning it can open up numerous job opportunities. [...] FAQ\n\nQ: Which framework is easiest for beginners in 2025 – React, Angular, or Vue?  \nA: Vue.js is often cited as the easiest to pick up for beginners due to its simple syntax and gentle learning curve. React has a moderate learning curve and a huge community for support, making it a great second step. Angular is the most complex to learn initially, but it pays off in larger projects. Refonte Learning usually suggests starting with either React or Vue for a foundation, then learning Angular for a comprehensive skill set. [...] ## Angular in 2025: The Enterprise Framework\n\nAngular, maintained by Google, is a comprehensive front-end framework known for its all-in-one approach. Unlike React, Angular is a complete MVC-style framework – it comes with a powerful templating system, built-in routing, form validation, HTTP services, and more. Modern Angular (versions 2+), which is written in TypeScript, has a steeper learning curve, but it offers a structured way to build large applications. In 2025, Angular is on version 16 (with 17 around the corner), and it has introduced cutting-edge features like Signals – a reactive state mechanism that improves performance by reducing unnecessary component re-renders."

      "snippet": "UI libraries and Frameworks also come with quite a hefty learning curve compared to just the core Technologies so that's something you might need to take into account when you're deciding whether it's the right time to use a framework also where the core Technologies of HTML CSS and JavaScript are not evolving or changing that often Frameworks do tend to be improved and upgraded so you may find yourself spending a fair amount of time doing maintenance to your application upgrading to the newest version whatever it might be and it's possible that's not something that you want to spend your time doing and lastly if you are already embedded in a codebase it's possible that the framework of your choice may not be super compatible or at least not easily compatible with your exist existing code [...] in order to give some structure to the curriculum and in true scrimba fashion we are going to be building a project throughout this section called react facts and although it may look like a simple static page it's really going to help us get the solid foundation that we need and react to continue on to maybe some of the more exciting projects that we have in this course throughout this section we are going to be learning why you should even care about react chances are you found this course because you were were told that learning react is an important step if you're hoping to get a job as a web developer or level up your skills in the web development Arena and so I think it's crucial to understand why people are telling you to learn react naturally we'll be learning how to set up a new [...] my years of teaching react I have found that props tends to be one of the first hurdles for people that are just getting into learning react and so my plan is to take the topic of props and to spread it out a little bit thin we'll take one little step at a time and in typical scrimba fashion you'll get your hands on the keyboard and I think by the end you'll have a really solid understanding of how props works and react so without further Ado let's jump in and start learning one of the most impactful and exciting aspects of react let's start by understanding the basic concept of props and react what you see here is just a plain index.html file we haven't introduced anything dealing with react in this I want you to take a close look at the elements that you see here and see if you can"

      "snippet": "kind of the old days of creating HTML code where if we're trying to stuff everything into one place not only do the elements not become reusable but it becomes really difficult to maintain as a developer so creating our variable up here got us one step closer but it's still not quite good enough instead what we are going to start learning about is creating our own custom components now I give you a taste of this early on in the course but we're going to actually learn it the real way now in programming the concept of a function is one that allows us to write some code that we can then execute over and over and over again just by calling that function and react adopts the same concept of having a function that allows us to create user interface or create elements over and over and over [...] syntax and you could say the vocabulary of react because I found that the best approach to learning react is to first start learning how to think in react the reason for this is because react really does kind of change the game in terms of how you build applications later in this section we are going to start learning the differences between declarative and imperative programming and you're going to find that react approaches web development in a completely different way so the point is we're first going to be dialing in our brains to start thinking in terms of using reacts to build websites by first building some static web pages not unlike the ones that you normally would just use HTML and CSS for so this might not seem terribly exciting right now but I think you'll soon see that [...] do all the challenges and projects you're involved with the community and you are an active participant in your own learning I can promise that you'll probably finish off in a better spot than many students get getting their degree in computer science and I really don't say that lightly along those lines remember that space learning and repetition are your best friends binging the course from beginning to end even if you are doing all the assignments is kind of like trying to run an ultra marathon without training your brain actually needs rest so take breaks Often by taking this course the goal isn't just to get to the end it's to get to the end with some honest goodness react skills then after you come back to this course on maybe the next day don't be afraid to rewatch some of the past"
