[...] GC is a founding partner of the Coalition Network.\n\nThe elegant model is a win-win-win for everyone involved. GC’s founders get access to talented and diverse advisors without taking additional dilution or slowing their fundraising process. Top operators get access to advisory opportunities with vetted startups where they can build their track records and connect with a community of peers at a similar inflection point in their careers. GC gets to support our founders, expand our network and extend access beyond the people we already know. We have some real skin in the game, sharing a portion of our financial upside with the operators in the Coalition Network. By standardizing on this model, we can deliver an incredible experience to each individual company, with portfolio-scale impact. [...] The Coalition Network was built to diversify the cap tables of some of the world’s most promising start-ups by creating a community of prominent women and women of color who are eager to leverage their talents and expertise as founders, operators and angel investors.  The Coalition Network is the brainchild of four powerhouse women - Toyin Ajayi co-founder of Cityblock Health, Lindsay Ullman co-founder of Umbrella, Jackie Nelson co-founder of Tribe AI, and Ashley Mayer former VP of Communications at Glossier–who together understand the tremendous benefit this untapped talent pool can offer to founders and their companies. When the team first ran the idea by me in 2020, I knew it was something my partners and I had to help bring to life.\n\nGC is a founding partner of the Coalition Network."
