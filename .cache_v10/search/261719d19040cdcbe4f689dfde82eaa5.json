[...] ### Dr. Jeffrey Rood's Research Group\n\nResearch interests lie in two main areas. In coordination chemistry, new alkaline earth and transition metal complexes are synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as potential catalysts for various types of reactions or applied to cellular systems as possible insulin mimetics. Also under development are novel Metal-Organic Frameworks, porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linker molecules that assemble together into extended, three-dimensional structures, and whose pore shape and size are dictated by the identity of the metal and the length of the organic molecules. These materials are of interest for applications such as the storage of small molecules and potential as luminescence-based sensors. [...] ### Dr. Kristi Kneas's Research Group\n\nSpecific research projects in analytical chemistry are designed to further efforts in one of three broad areas of interest: luminescence-based sensing materials and schemes to measure clinically and environmentally-relevant targets (e.g., oxygen, humidity, and blood lactate levels), improved instrumentation and industrial processes (e.g. laser spectroscopy, polyelectrolyte membrane fuel cells, greener manufacturing processes), and analytical sensing schemes for forensics applications (e.g., authentication of questioned documents using Ion pairing-HPLC for ink dating).\n\nRepresentative  Publications (undergraduate student authors underlined):"

      "snippet": "The art of producing recombinant proteins with complex post-translational modifications represents a major challenge for studies of structure and function. The rapid establishment and high recovery from transiently-transfected mammalian cell lines addresses this barrier and is an effective means of expressing proteins that are naturally channeled through the ER and Golgi-mediated secretory pathway. Here is one protocol for protein expression using the human HEK293F and HEK293S cell lines transfected with a mammalian expression vector designed for high protein yields. The applicability of this system is demonstrated using three representative glycoproteins that expressed with yields between 95-120 mg of purified protein recovered per liter of culture. These proteins are the human FcγRIIIa [...] U.S. flag\n\nAn official website of the United States government\n\nDot gov\n\nThe .gov means it’s official.\n  \nFederal government websites often end in .gov or .mil.
