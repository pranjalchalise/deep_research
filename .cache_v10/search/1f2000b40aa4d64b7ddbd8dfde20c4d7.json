      "snippet": "then we need to pay attention to that so what we were talking about actually\nwas syria and you go into syria and you think\nhey we're going to do this little thing in syria and it will have this impact\nand we'll be good to go and you what you're saying is\ni'm going to hit with one i'm going to hit right where i'm aiming for\nwell what are the chances of that they're not really good so what do you\ndo oh you need to figure it out you need to\nfigure out if if it's the error boxes hey we might go\n10 to 10 to the left 10 to the right now we know and by the way if we don't get a\nreset there our next leg is going to have an even\nbigger error box so when you look at something in a\nstrategic way like syria what your assumption has to be you have\nto you have to go through that whole thing [...] to you have to go through that whole thing\nas if your error box never got reset and you missed every single time and by\nthe end of it then you have to look at the total\ncost of what it would take to solve that ultimate situation\nand that's what you have to be willing to commit and we don't do that\nwhat we say is well we'll go in and do this and it'll have this impact\nand then from that perfect spot that we know\nwe'll do something else and it will will be perfect again\nand so the same thing happens in business what\npeople unfortunately have a tendency to do\nis they plan with a positive attitude and we don't want to plan with a\npositive attitude we don't want to say well you know dave if we make um\ndrinks we're gonna we're gonna if we put if we\nput put uh drinks in a can our assumption is [...] psychologically so that's on us that's on me and\nand you know as leif explains in the book\nwhen we got back and we put together the brief that i was briefing to the the\nnaval special warfare community at large about what we had\ndone and leif for the first time put together\nwow we went and helped the 1-1 a.d win back the city even he didn't hadn't\nreally assembled that in his head so i'm sitting there and he said that\nhe's like man we really had a big impact and i'm like\nashamed because if he didn't really see that how\nin god's name could one of his front-line guys see it\nnow look part of this is because that trust that leif did have and seth same\nthing like hey we're gonna go get after it you know\nwhat those guys say roger point me in the direction of bad guys"
