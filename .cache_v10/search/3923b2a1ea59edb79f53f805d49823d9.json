      "snippet": "Amherst is a member of the Five Colleges, a consortium with nearby Smith, Mount Holyoke, and Hampshire Colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Students may take courses at any of the colleges, and the schools’ proximity adds to Amherst’s rich social and extracurricular life. [...] Amherst celebrated its Bicentennial year in 2021. [...] Diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to Amherst’s mission. The College enrolls students from nearly every U.S. state and from more than 50 countries, and close to half of U.S. students self-identify as students of color. Amherst is one of the few truly need-blind colleges in the nation: students are admitted without regard to financial need, and each admitted student is guaranteed financial aid equal to demonstrated financial need. The College’s financial aid packages are consistently among the most substantial in the nation. Amherst’s outstanding resources, dedicated faculty, and rigorous academic life allow the College to enroll students with an extraordinary range of talents, interests, and commitments."
