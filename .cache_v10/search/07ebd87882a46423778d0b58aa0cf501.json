      "snippet": "### Body\n\nImmigration continues to play a large role in the 2024 US presidential race, with former president Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris now running against each other, following President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s withdrawal from the race on July 21, 2024. Trump has focused on immigration in his campaign, dedicating time at nearly every campaign stop to border issues and his plans to fix them should he win reelection. Immigration dominated every night of the 2024 Republican National Convention and was a major point of contention at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024. Now, Trump is blaming Harris for the border crisis, labeling her Biden's \"border czar\" and attacking her immigration record in political ads. [...] | Sources: Trump has vowed on many occasions to carry out the \"largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\" Stephen Miller outlined and endorsed the policy proposal on November 11, 2023, in a comprehensive interview with the New York Times on Trump's 2025 immigration plans, and the proposal was also highlighted at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024.  As for the specifics of this policy proposal, Trump promised to move troops to the US border to carry out deportations several times, including at a campaign rally on October 29, 2023, in an op-ed for the Des Moines Register on January 3, 2024, and in an interview with Time Magazine on April 30, 2024. Miller endorsed the authorization of ICE workplace raids in both a podcast interview on November 14, 2023, and his [...] Vice President Kamala Harris has reiterated Biden's stance that the US immigration system is broken and requires a legislative fix, both along the campaign trail and in her duties as vice president. At a New York Times summit on November 30, 2023, Harris stressed \"It [the US immigration system] needs to be repaired, and we are working on that in a way that we establish a safe and humane and orderly immigration system at the border.\" Harris pushed for the failed bipartisan border deal in a White House press release on February 4, 2024, urging Republicans to \"address it [the border deal] with the urgency and seriousness it requires…rather than politicize this issue.\" On July 30, 2024, at a campaign rally in Atlanta, GA, Harris castigated Trump for tanking the bipartisan border deal as well"

      "snippet": "As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, immigration remains a central theme. Former President Donald Trump advocates for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, restricting entry for refugees and asylum seekers, reinstating the Remain in Mexico program, expanding the border wall, and reducing worker visas. He also proposes banning entry from Muslim-majority countries and ending DACA protections, which offers protection from deportation and a work permit, requiring renewal every two years, as a path to citizenship for individuals who were under 16 when they were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents before June 15, 2012. [...] ### The economic impact of the candidates' proposals\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll from October 2024, 21% of Americans view immigration as the most pressing non-economic concern. A joint study by Brookings, AEI, and the Niskanen Center analyzed high- and low-immigration scenarios under each candidate’s plan and found that net immigration would be far higher under Harris’s policies, with a forecasted net migration of 3.7 million in 2025 vs. Trump’s forecasted net migration of 740,000. [...] About 47% of Americans support deporting all undocumented immigrants, broken out as 84% of Republicans and 22% of Democrats. Attitudes also differ on asylum and border security policies, with Democrats favoring more lenient approaches and Republicans pushing for stricter controls. Despite these divisions, there is broad recognition across the political spectrum that the U.S. immigration system requires reform to better balance enforcement and economic opportunity."

      "snippet": "By Bo Erickson, Brad Brooks, Tim Reid and Nathan Layne\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's hardline immigration agenda, a key force behind his return to the White House in 2024, is increasingly showing signs of becoming a liability, threatening Republican prospects in the November midterm elections.\n\nWhat was once his most potent campaign issue is now driving unease among voters unsettled by the administration’s aggressive tactics in its immigration crackdown, including the targeting of U.S. citizens and violent ​measures against peaceful protesters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement [...] White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration's approach to immigration.\n\n\"President Trump wants all Americans to feel safe in their communities. That guiding principle is why the President has promised to remove dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our country, urged local Democrat leaders to work with federal ⁠law enforcement, and called for a fact-based investigation into the tragic death of Mr. Pretti,\" she ‌said in a statement.\n\nDubbed Operation Metro Surge, the December deployment of nearly 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minneapolis and St. Paul provoked a national uproar with the fatal shootings of Renee Good on January 7 and then Alex Pretti on January 24. Both were killed during confrontations with immigration agents at protests.\n\nAdvertisement [...] Just 39% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of immigration, the lowest ‌since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday. While 84% of Republican respondents said they support Trump on the issue, a fifth of them said federal agents had gone \"too far\" in their crackdown.\n\nIf those sentiments persist, they could spell trouble for Republicans in November, when Democrats are aiming to take control of Congress and block the president's agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This was one of the president's number one advantages and it has become a political liability for him,\" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. \"The base is still pretty comfortable with what Trump is doing. But it's not just about the base, it's about swing voters.\""

They may agree with Donald Trump's determination to address immigration. They don't agree with the treatment that he's applying to it. >> Another big issue obviously for so many people out there is the economy. Terry, I want to switch it back over to you. Uh our polling shows that 60% of Americans think President Trump makes the situation sound better than it really is. So, how significant of an issue do you see that disconnect? >> Look, the economy is is one of those things where you can you can look at what the stock market's doing. Um, and you can look at at all these outside barometers, but it's how it feels to you. And and so when voters say, \"Hey, the economy is tough for me at my kitchen table [...] of immigration so far.

Look, America is is first of all the greatest country in the world and that's why people want to come here and we have a big heart and we allow people to come here. Uh but as guests um and it's it's not their right. And so I think Americans get uh very tired of being feeling like they're being taken advantage of um or even in this case tragically abused. Um so I think that there's uh that's where the Americans have support for these strong immigration policies is look let's invite people. Let's have, you know, open arms and big hearts, but but let's not be dumb about it and let's not let violent people into the country or people who want to take advantage of America. >>"

He also has indicated that he will deploy the National Guard, as well as active duty military personnel, if needed, to the U.S.-Mexico border, although details of the plan remain unclear. Heightened military presence at the border can lead to increased fears among immigrant families living in border areas and using part of the military budget for border security could face legal challenges. [...] ## Introduction\n\nImmigration was a central campaign issue during the 2024 Presidential election with President-elect Trump vowing to take strict action to restrict both lawful and unlawful immigration into the U.S. Such actions would have stark impacts on the health and well-being of immigrant families as well as major economic consequences for the nation. As of 2023, there were 47.1 million immigrants residing in the U.S., and one in four children had an immigrant parent.1  Increased immigration boosts federal revenues and lowers the national deficit through immigrants’ participation in the country’s economy, workforce, and through billions of dollars in tax contributions. [...] President-elect Trump said he plans to significantly limit the entry of humanitarian migrants into the U.S. during his second term by restricting refugee limits, shutting down the CBP One application for asylum seekers, and eliminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for immigrants from some countries.During his first term, President Trump set the annual refugee admissions ceiling at its lowest levels, ranging from 50,000 in 2017 to a historic low of 18,000 in 2020. The Biden administration increased the limit to 65,000 in 2021, a level close to the annual ceilings prior to the first Trump term, and further increased the limits in 2022 and 2024 in response to humanitarian concerns. It is likely that President-elect Trump will reduce the admissions ceiling for refugees in his"
