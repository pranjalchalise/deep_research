      "snippet": "Results: The results of this study indicate that deer and foxes were impacted by habitat characteristics, with positive responses to roads and negative responses to forests. Meanwhile, deer, humans, and squirrels were affected by microclimate variables such as heat stress and air temperature. Deer and squirrels had a negative association with humans when we accounted for the presence of dogs, and deer and humans differed in the time of day they were active. We must obtain more data to assess the impact on bears, bobcats, and coyotes. [...] This finding indicates that tRNA modifying enzymes can have a strong impact on the function of translation and silencing which inhibits the production of proteins. Qualitative analysis of the results of the second screen found several instances of upregulation of the gfp transgene in lin-35 (-);JR672 (scm::gfp) organisms. The brightest results were in a range of different tRNA modifying enzymes functions, including the uracil to pseudo-Uracil RNA modification, as well as the guanine to Queuosine (Q), manQ, and galQ. This suggests that tRNA modifying enzymes mediate ERI, which is evidence of their effect on small RNAs and mRNAs (central components to the ERI pathway), making them more promiscuous at identifying the transgene. [...] Conclusion: The two RNAi screens provide insight into tRNA modifying enzymes, with the first revealing enzymes that have a strong impact on the function of translation in the rars-1 mutant strain, and the second suggesting the numerous effects on a range of RNAs in the ERI phenotype.\n28 Biology Human recreation, geographic characteristics, and microclimate impact on habitat use in the Holyoke Range Marie Wheeler1, Ellen Wolstenholme1, Zaynah Shariff1, Thea Kristensen1 1Department of Biology, Amherst College, Amherst, MA, USA Purpose: Outdoor recreation can change wildlife land usage, with past studies finding that deer and smaller mammals use land near human recreation more readily, while carnivores tend to avoid these areas."

At Amherst, students learn these skills by working collaboratively with faculty and with each other, often on small teams, forming vital relationships.\n\n## Section Navigation [...] The Amherst–Folger Undergraduate Fellowship program began in 1996 and awards as many as six student fellowships each year, enabling Amherst students to explore the collections of one of the world’s premier research libraries—the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. The program takes an expansive view of research and has included projects not only in English and history, but in anthropology, psychology, art, music, Black studies, digital humanities, Asian studies, political science and Statistics. The fellowship program is overseen at Amherst by the Center for Humanistic Inquiry, with funds provided by the Friends of the Amherst College Library.\n\nLearn more about the Amherst–Folger Undergraduate Fellowship program »"
