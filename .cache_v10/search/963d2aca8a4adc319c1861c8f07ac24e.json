      "snippet": "Still, overall deportations remained well below the stated goal of 1 million per year and even below the number during Joe Biden’s final year as president. However, limited data releases by the Trump administration make it difficult to compare the records. In December, ICE stated DHS had “removed” 622,000 noncitizens under Trump, whereas the Biden administration carried out 778,000 total repatriations in fiscal year (FY) 2024, including noncitizens denied entry at airports and U.S. borders. It appears that DHS’s count includes both removals from within U.S. communities and returns of individuals who crossed the border without authorization. Unlike in prior administrations, DHS has not publicly broken down the number of removals and returns under Trump or detailed the number of [...] On his first day in office, Trump suspended refugee resettlement, although the administration later resettled a small number of White South Africans. Only 506 refugees were resettled from February to October, 342 of them from South Africa, compared to just over 100,000 resettlements in FY 2024. The ceiling for resettlement in FY 2026 was set at a record-low 7,500, and just 720 refugees were resettled from October through December 2025 (see Figure 3). The commensurate slashing of refugee funding has resulted in refugee-serving organizations across the country closing and leaving many refugees with little support. In June, the State Department reallocated $250 million originally intended for resettled refugees to support DHS’s self-deportation program."

      "snippet": "As the 2024 election approaches, immigration remains a central issue. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have presented markedly different approaches to immigration and its value to the United States. Voters will have an opportunity to study each candidate’s views and decide our nation’s approach to immigration policy for the foreseeable future. In his previous term as president, Trump pursued policies limiting legal immigration, diminishing humanitarian protections, and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. As vice president in the Biden-Harris administration, Harris’ work focused on leading the administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In this role, she pursued public- and [...] In June 2024, in what would be a different approach from efforts to limit student visas during his administration, Trump called for providing green cards to all graduating international students.\nHARRIS: YES Harris argues that legal immigrants are part of “the fabric of America.” The Biden-Harris administration has largely restored legal immigration channels to the U.S., including by issuing a final rule that reversed a number of the Trump administration’s restrictions. The Biden-Harris administration’s immigration legislative framework would aim to eliminate employment-based visa backlogs, recapture unused visas, reduce lengthy wait times, and eliminate per-country visa caps, all of which would increase legal immigration to the U.S. THE FUTURE OF U.S. IMMIGRATION: 8. [...] HARRIS: MIXED The Biden-Harris administration has implemented policies that dramatically limit the right to asylum at the U.S. southern border, while at the same time expanding orderly pathways to come to the U.S. The administration released an interim final rule, “Securing the Border,” on June 4, 2024, that significantly restricts access to the right to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The rule was released alongside the presidential proclamation that “shuts down” the U.S. southern border and is in effect unless migrant crossings substantially decline over a prolonged period. Under the interim final rule, when the presidential proclamation’s suspension of entry is in place, most people who ask for protection will be disqualified from asylum — whether they have crossed the border"

      "snippet": "The immigration policies of the Trump administration have resulted in a documented increase in \"reverse migratory flow\", whereby immigrants (predominantly Venezuelans) originally destined for the United States are returning through Panama. There has been an 83% decrease in migration toward the United States through Colombia while thousands migrate south, often using dangerous alternative paths through remote areas. Combined with funding cuts to USAID, this has caused a nutrition crisis among migrants in the region. In January 2025, Leslie Voltaire, the president of Haiti warned that Trump's policies like blocking and deporting migrants can have catastrophic consequences for the country which \"cannot handle the influx\". The travel ban which Trump issued in June, may have negative impacts [...] Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term as president on January 20, 2025, with one of his key campaign promises being to crack down on illegal immigration. That evening, Trump signed several executive orders related to immigration, including declaring a national emergency at the Mexico–United States border, blocking asylum seekers from entering the U.S., ending the process of \"catch and release\" \"Catch and release (immigration)\") for illegal immigrants, ending birthright citizenship for new children born to parents who are not U.S. permanent residents, suspending almost all refugee admissions to the U.S., and officially designating certain international cartels and criminal organizations as terrorists. Trump signed the Laken Riley Act on January 29, 2025, which mandates the [...] As of May 2025, monthly figures for apprehensions on the US-Mexico border showed a precipitous year-on-year decrease in excess of 90% to 8,300, 7,200 and 8,400 for February, March and April 2025 respectively compared with the corresponding months in 2024. Historically, no full year has averaged below 9,000 apprehensions per month since the late 1960s.\n\n### Brain drain\n\nThe deportations of lawful permanent residents and visa holders, along with research funding cuts, have made the United States less attractive for students, white-collar workers and researchers. A March 2025 poll showed that 75% of US scientists were considering leaving. Ursula von der Leyen announced in May 2025 a two-year €500 million investment (approximately $556 million) to support US scientists moving to Europe."

      "snippet": "1. INTRODUCTION During his, 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump pledged to reduce immigration and implement large-scale deportations. Alongside his supporters and advisors, various strategies to achieve this goal have been discussed and documented, providing a clear outline of the policies that could be expected during his second term. In the following, we highlight the main potential policy changes that could dramatically impact US immigration (DePillis and Smialek, 2024; Pillai and Artiga, 2024; Esterline, 2024; McKibbin et al., 2024): 2. TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION PLAN CHAIR International Migration Economics www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu 2  Ending birthright citizenship for US-born children of unauthorized immigrants  Authorizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids of [...] Recent simulations using the Gallup World Polls show that a second Trump mandate will largely affect migration intentions. Focusing on Mexican migrants – whose 99% prospective migrants designate the USA as their intended destination – Beine et al., 2024, evaluate that in case of a second mandate replicating the, 2016, one in terms of immigration policies, the number of Mexicans desiring to immigrate to the US would decrease by 1.2 million. Should the policy be more stringent and include a complete closure of the border, then the decrease would reach 8, 6 million, with most people deciding to stay in Mexico, and some who would switch to other destinations such as Canada, Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. For instance, in the first scenario, the Mexican migration pressure [...] Furthermore, the Trumpian anti-immigration rhetoric is likely to induce an adverse selection effect. High-skilled migrants are more sensitive to the \"repulsive\" aspects of the populist, anti-immigration narrative, and also enjoy greater migration opportunities and a greater set of destination choices. According to Docquier and Vasilakis, 2024, globally, a 10-percentage point increase in the vote share of right-wing populist parties reduces the inflow of highly-skilled immigrants by 10-percentage point more than those of low-skilled migrants. In the specific case of a second Trump mandate, Beine et al., 2024, estimate that the US attractiveness for high-skilled Mexican migrants would be reduced four times more than for low-skilled migrants. This deterioration in the skill composition may"

      "snippet": "Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it?\n From snowy cities to Mexican border - Trump deportations loom\n 'No choice but to go back' - migrants despair over Trump border restrictions\n\nExpedited removals were previously limited to areas within 100 miles (160km) of US international borders, and applied to those who did not request asylum or failed to show a legitimate case for asylum.\n\nWith Trump's changes, these removals can now occur anywhere in the US, and will apply to undocumented migrants who can't prove that they have been in the country for more than two years.\n\nDeportations are not unique to the Trump administration.\n\nBiden carried out deportations as well, with 271,000 immigrants deported to 192 countries in fiscal year 2024. [...] In June 2024, however, the Biden administration issued its own executive order that temporarily suspended the right to seek asylum for those who did not arrive at an official point of entry, or without an appointment using CBP One, a mobile application. In September, asylum restrictions were tightened further.\n\nTrump has also halted the US refugee resettlement programme. Under Biden in 2024, the US accepted more than 100,000 refugees - its highest since 1995.\n\nHe also ended a major Biden-era programme that allowed up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly into the US on humanitarian grounds. [...] Border crossings significantly dropped in Biden's final year as president. In December 2024 - the last full month of the Biden administration - about 47,330 migrant apprehensions were recorded, down from a high of nearly 250,000 in December 2023.\n\nThe figures are lower than the monthly averages in Trump's first term, before the Covid-19 pandemic. In May 2019, for example, border patrol agents recorded 132,800 migrant encounters.\n\n## Halting the processing of migrants and asylum seekers\n\nIn an executive order, Trump suspended the entry of all undocumented migrants to the US, and border patrol agents have been instructed to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings.\n\nBefore the order, migrants were able to arrive at the US border and had the legal right to seek asylum."
