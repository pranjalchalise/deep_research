But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020)\n\n“A surreal utopia where friends turned into F.R.I.E.N.D.S, and fanatics into professionals. Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2020\n\n## Shruti Pokhrel\n\nTeam Kisan(2020)\n\n“Incubate Nepal was truly an overwhelming experience that paved the way for me to make connections with people whilst developing teamwork and analytical skills. Exposure to open-ended projects under the guidance of some of the highly accomplished mentors to channel our creative stream and collaborate in prototyping an application ‘KISAN' - perhaps the best aspect of the project. It was through this opportunity that I was able to peek into the world beyond and believe in the possibility of the tremendous potential there is for me to learn and work in the near future.”\n\n2020\n\n## Shrijan Pandey\n\nTeam Arthasastra(2020)"

When I am not running, you can often find me in the music building or the science center, as I am a member of the Glee Club and Concert Choir while co-leading the Mammoth MakerLab Club. For the past two years, I have been a member of the Education Professions group and enjoy having meaningful discussions and workshops with my peers. In my free time, I also love hiking, biking, reading, and spending time with my family and friends. [...] At Amherst, I’m involved in research with the Chemistry department on energy transfer using quantum dots for different applications. Since freshman year, I’ve been involved in research with the Spanish/LLAS department on community filmmaking in Latin America. On campus I’m a member of La Causa, La Fe, and Questbridge. Last semester, I attended the American Educational Research Association’s international conference in Philadelphia. This summer I had the pleasure of doing a research internship at UPenn in the Mechanical/Chemical Engineering department.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, baking, watching Netflix, and getting boba with friends. [...] Aside from working at the Loeb Center, I also love rowing with the crew team, doing mock trial, or going to the occasional wrestling practice with the UMass club wrestling team. I also love to knit, and you’ll often find me working on a sweater or hat in between classes.\n\n## Maggie Su\n\nEmployer Engagement Intern\n\nHi, I’m Maggie Su, class of 2028. I’m double-majoring in Mathematics and Economics, while also constantly exploring the variety of courses Amherst offers.
