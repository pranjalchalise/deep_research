It is characterized by three main dimensions: Emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced personal effectiveness. Chronic academic stress can lead to mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Early detection of burnout allows for intervention before more severe symptoms develop.\n\nObjective\n\nThis study aimed to develop and assess the psychometric properties of the English version of the School Burnout Inventory (SBI) for University Students while providing further psychometric evidence for the pre-existing Italian version of the scale (SBI-U/I).\n\nMethods [...] 6 Department of Educational Psychology, Faculty of Education, Suez Canal University, Ismailia 41528, Egypt\n\n7 Center of Excellence for the Acceleration of Harm Reduction, University of Catania, Catania, Sicily 95123, Italy\n\n8 Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Psychiatry Unit, University of Catania, Catania, Sicily 95123, Italy\n\nHPR, e81240035 \n\nSubmitted: 24 April 2025 | Revised: 30 July 2025 | Accepted: 31 July 2025 | Published: 6 October 2025\n\n© 2025 by the Author(s).
