In Advances in Genetic Programming 2, edited by P. Angeline and K. Kinnear. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. [...] Lee Spector This chapter shows how a genetic programming system can be used to simultaneously evolve pro-grams and their control structures. Koza has previously shown that the performance of a genetic pro-gramming system can sometimes be improved by allowing for the simultaneous evolution of a main program and a collection of automatically deﬁned functions (ADFs). This chapter shows how related techniques can be used to simultaneously evolve a main program and a collection of automatically deﬁned macros (ADMs). Examples are provided to show how the use of ADMs can lead to the pro-duction of useful new control structures during evolution, and data is presented to show that ADMs sometimes provide a greater beneﬁt than do ADFs. The chapter includes a discussion of characteris-tics of [...] Kinnear, K.E. Jr. (1994) “Alternatives in Automatic Function Deﬁnition: A Comparison of Performance.” In K.E.
