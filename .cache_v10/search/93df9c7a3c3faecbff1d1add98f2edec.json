      "snippet": "in deciding the number of participants in qualitative research. More specifically, the paper aimed to answer the three research questions: (1) How could the sample of the qualitative research be determined?(2) What is the rationale behind utilising the small samples in qualitative research? and (3)What is the optimal sample size in qualitative research? Methodology: Semi-systematic Review This paper is based on my experience to determine the participant numbers for my PhD study. In addition, I have embedded my experience with existing literature. In qualitative research, the researcher himself or herself is both a tool and a participant. Therefore, the researcher's positionality and reflection influence the study (Berger, 2013; Tracy, 2020). Searching literature itself could be a [...] the importance of purposive sampling that \"good qualitative researchers, at the very least, engage in purposeful sampling, which means that they purposefully choose data that fit the parameters of the project’s research questions, goals, and purposes\" (p.82). In the same vein, I had adopted purposive sampling in my PhD study because purposive sampling allows me to select the rich-information participants that generally cannot be obtained from other participants. In addition, I had developed the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the participant selection for my PhD research. [...] scholars embrace bias by considering human interactions between researchers and their participants\" (Crick, 2021, p. 6). However, the epistemological base of qualitative research is the co-construction of knowledge from the researcher and the participants through in-depth exploration from small number of samples. I am also a teacher educator at TU and I have supervised the master's degree theses. Most of the students under my supervision have carried out qualitative research and faced the problem of determining a sufficient number of participants for their study. They used to ask me about the appropriate number of participants for their qualitative research. Likewise, I have been carrying out a narrative inquiry for my PhD study having six participants. During the proposal development, I"

      "title": "Securing Nature's Contributions to People requires at least 20%",
      "snippet": "Biodiversity is rapidly declining, affecting benefits critical to human well-being, including food production, water quality, climate regulation, and recreation spaces. This decline is particularly challenging in urban and agricultural areas significantly modified by humans but where reliance on biodiversity’s benefits is nevertheless high. We assess the minimum level of (semi-)natural habitat needed in human-modified landscapes to support the supply of these benefits. We find that biodiversity’s capacity to pollinate crops, regulate pests and diseases, maintain clear water, and limit soil erosion significantly declines when habitat area falls below 20%–25% per km2. This same limit applies in urban areas to maintain recreation spaces for people. We find that approximately two-thirds of [...] ## Summary [...] ## Graphical abstract\n\n## Keywords\n\nfunctional integrity\n\nbiodiversity\n\necosystem services\n\nNature’s Contributions to People\n\nhuman-modified landscapes\n\npollination\n\npest and disease control\n\nsoil conservation\n\nwater quality regulation\n\nrecreation\n\n## Cited by (0)\n\n12\n:   X (formerly Twitter): @awazmsm\n\n13\n:   Lead contact\n\n© 2023 The Authors.
