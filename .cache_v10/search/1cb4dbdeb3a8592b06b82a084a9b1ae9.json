      "snippet": "As result of this shift in tone, many immigrants’ fear their relationship with their adopted country is changing. Large numbers of immigrants—including many naturalized citizens—told pollsters they feared being arrested and deported, and modified their daily habits to be less visible. Enrollment of new international students at U.S. universities dropped by 17 percent in fall 2025 compared to the prior year, as many opted for other destinations (see Item 4. As Labor Demands Rise amid Demographic Change, Under-the-Radar Policies Seek to Fill Gaps). International travel to the United States also appeared to decline, for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. [...] For international students, changes in the United States—the top destination for overseas study—further diversified a landscape that had already started to shift. The number of new international students at U.S. higher education institutions dropped 17 percent in fall 2025 compared to the prior year, as it and other traditional destinations—Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom—imposed new barriers. Many students are opting for alternative destinations, including several in East and Southeast Asia, which have sought to capitalize on the trend. [...] Even as it tightened restrictions on some types of immigration, the United Kingdom planned to double the number of high-skilled visas for foreign workers. China meanwhile unveiled a new K visa targeting young high-tech workers and researchers who meet certain criteria, in what was seen as a response to U.S. hardening of its policies for high-skilled immigrants. And the European Union plotted a new visa strategy to help the bloc fill skills and labor shortages."

      "snippet": "Furthermore, when it comes to immigration in general (aside from workforce trends), the United States continues to have more immigrants than any other country – with “one-fifth of the world’s international migrants” making their home in the U.S., according to a September 2024 report from Pew Research Center. Reasons for immigration can include poverty, attempts to escape violence, work or educational opportunities, or reunification with family.\n\nDuring modern times, U.S. immigration also continues to increase. In states including California, Texas, Florida, and New York, immigrants account for about one in five residents, according to a January 2025 Bloomberg news report. [...] Border policy (detailing that the administration will “marshal all available resources and authorities” to stop illegal immigration, including establishing a physical wall and deploying “sufficient personnel along the southern border of the United States to ensure complete operational control”)\n “Enhanced vetting and screening,” including for visa applicants and foreign nationals seeking admission to the U.S.\n Birthright citizenship (stating that this right does not automatically extend to certain persons born in the United States)\n The U.S.‑Mexico-Canada Agreement (as the order established an “America First Trade Policy”)\n Enforcement policies related to illegal entry (including for those seeking asylum, as this order revoked Biden-era executive orders) [...] Notably, the U.S. also makes permanent immigration a different issue than temporary immigration, and the executive branch is allowed to “exercise statutory or executive authority to allow certain noncitizens to enter or remain in the United States on a time-limited basis, including those who have not been admitted through permanent or temporary pathways under the INA and might otherwise be subject to removal,” with these pathways including TPS and immigration parole, according to Congress."

Currently, F-1 students can work only on campus and must request special permission to work off-campus. Furthermore, this policy would grant full work authorization to the spouses of F-1 students under the F-2 visa, of which there are very few because most international students are unmarried undergraduate and graduate students. But some graduate students do have F-2 spouses who are currently unable to work. This policy would result in nearly 120,000 work [...] to work. This policy would result in nearly 120,000 work visa dependents being able to work and nearly 800,000 international students and dependents being able to work legally."
