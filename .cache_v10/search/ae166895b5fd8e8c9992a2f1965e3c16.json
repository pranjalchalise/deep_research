      "snippet": "Eduardo Porter and Kristie De Peña reflected on the shifting public sentiment and the future of immigration policy. Porter cited polling data showing a sharp reversal in public opinion, with ICE approval ratings dropping from +16 in early 2025 to -14 by November, which he attributed to the reaction to mass deportations. De Peña added that while the current policies are restrictive, the disruption forces a necessary conversation about rebuilding the system. Looking ahead to the possibility of a political shift in 2028, the panel was skeptical that the country could simply revert to previous norms, with Porter noting you can’t “put the toothpaste back in the tube.” Edelberg warned that the U.S. faces reputational damage that could drive global talent to Canada, Europe, or Asia over the [...] Tara Watson opened the discussion with findings released in a new report authored by Wendy Edelberg, Stan Veuger, and Tara Watson. They estimate a historic shift: Net migration to the U.S. was negative in 2025, a sharp reversal from net inflows exceeding three million in 2023 and two million in 2024. During the panel discussion, Edelberg expanded on the economic implications of this decline: She estimated a sharp decline in labor supply growth and estimated the reduction in immigrant consumer spending lowered GDP by between $40 billion and $60 billion in 2025. [...] Representative Salazar discussed “The Dignity Act,” which she reintroduced to Congress in summer 2025 with Representative Veronica Escobar (D-Tex.). The goal of the act, Salazar explained, is to reform the current immigration system to better balance the U.S.’ economic and national security concerns. Salazar argued for a system that allows undocumented immigrants with no criminal record to “come out of the shadows” by paying a fine to gain legal status. Salazar emphasized that legalizing this workforce is essential for economic stability, stating that the goal is to create an environment where “everyone can show up Monday morning with no fear.” The bill would not include a path to citizenship for immigrants who participate, Salazar noted, and it would also enhance border security."

      "snippet": "### Body\n\nImmigration continues to play a large role in the 2024 US presidential race, with former president Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris now running against each other, following President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s withdrawal from the race on July 21, 2024. Trump has focused on immigration in his campaign, dedicating time at nearly every campaign stop to border issues and his plans to fix them should he win reelection. Immigration dominated every night of the 2024 Republican National Convention and was a major point of contention at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024. Now, Trump is blaming Harris for the border crisis, labeling her Biden's \"border czar\" and attacking her immigration record in political ads. [...] Vice President Kamala Harris has reiterated Biden's stance that the US immigration system is broken and requires a legislative fix, both along the campaign trail and in her duties as vice president. At a New York Times summit on November 30, 2023, Harris stressed \"It [the US immigration system] needs to be repaired, and we are working on that in a way that we establish a safe and humane and orderly immigration system at the border.\" Harris pushed for the failed bipartisan border deal in a White House press release on February 4, 2024, urging Republicans to \"address it [the border deal] with the urgency and seriousness it requires…rather than politicize this issue.\" On July 30, 2024, at a campaign rally in Atlanta, GA, Harris castigated Trump for tanking the bipartisan border deal as well [...] | Sources: Trump has vowed on many occasions to carry out the \"largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\" Stephen Miller outlined and endorsed the policy proposal on November 11, 2023, in a comprehensive interview with the New York Times on Trump's 2025 immigration plans, and the proposal was also highlighted at the first presidential debate on June 27, 2024.  As for the specifics of this policy proposal, Trump promised to move troops to the US border to carry out deportations several times, including at a campaign rally on October 29, 2023, in an op-ed for the Des Moines Register on January 3, 2024, and in an interview with Time Magazine on April 30, 2024. Miller endorsed the authorization of ICE workplace raids in both a podcast interview on November 14, 2023, and his"

      "snippet": "As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, immigration remains a central theme. Former President Donald Trump advocates for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, restricting entry for refugees and asylum seekers, reinstating the Remain in Mexico program, expanding the border wall, and reducing worker visas. He also proposes banning entry from Muslim-majority countries and ending DACA protections, which offers protection from deportation and a work permit, requiring renewal every two years, as a path to citizenship for individuals who were under 16 when they were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents before June 15, 2012. [...] About 47% of Americans support deporting all undocumented immigrants, broken out as 84% of Republicans and 22% of Democrats. Attitudes also differ on asylum and border security policies, with Democrats favoring more lenient approaches and Republicans pushing for stricter controls. Despite these divisions, there is broad recognition across the political spectrum that the U.S. immigration system requires reform to better balance enforcement and economic opportunity. [...] Such differences in immigration levels would directly impact economic growth. Harris’s policies could expand the labor force and boost GDP, while Trump’s measures could reduce GDP growth by as much as half a percentage point in 2025 alone—equivalent to about $130 billion. A Peterson Institute study warns that mass deportations under Trump’s plan would create inflationary pressures by shrinking the labor supply, driving up the cost of goods and services by several percentage points annually throughout his second term."

He also has indicated that he will deploy the National Guard, as well as active duty military personnel, if needed, to the U.S.-Mexico border, although details of the plan remain unclear. Heightened military presence at the border can lead to increased fears among immigrant families living in border areas and using part of the military budget for border security could face legal challenges.

In May 2024, the Biden administration published regulations to extend eligibility for Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace coverage with premium and cost-sharing subsidies to DACA recipients, who were previously ineligible for federally funded health coverage options. The regulation became effective November 1, 2024, allowing for enrollment during the 2025 Open Enrollment Period. In August 2024, a group of 19 states filed a lawsuit against the federal government alleging that the ACA Marketplace coverage expansion to DACA recipients violates the Administrative Procedure Act. On December 9, 2024, a federal court in North Dakota granted the plaintiffs’ motion by blocking the ACA"
