      "snippet": "GAMES Vietnam has become one of the biggest markets for online games in South East Asia. In 2018, Vietnam ranked 25th out of 100 countries in total game revenue, with revenues increasing by US$123 million in 2018 to US$490 million.92 The revenue exceeded that of the Philippines and Singapore. VNG, Vietnam’s largest provider of online games, is valued at US$1 billion by market research firms.93 Most of the growth comes from the mobile games market. Game apps in smartphones increased by 37% in 2016,94 and as much as 60% of smartphone app revenue in Vietnam comes from games. Flappy Bird, by Vietnam’s Nguyen Ha Dong, was the most-downloaded free game in the iOS App store in 2014.95 32 Vietnam’s future digital economy – Towards 2030 and 2045 1.5 Smart logistics The logistics sector has grown [...] such as aquaculture, flowers and fruits. For example, in 2016 a wireless sensor network was set up in a Vietnamese fish farm in Dong Thap Province, next to the Mekong River, to control water quality and prevent fish diseases. If implemented more widely, real-time monitoring on fish farms could help cut production losses by 40-50%, equating to a difference in turnover for each farm of at least US$12,000 every six months.55 Similar projects are being conducted across the country, with support from government policy and low interest loans. [...] The Vietnam’s Future Digital Economy Project is an innovative joint venture between Vietnam’s Ministry of Science and Technology and CSIRO’s Data61 from Australia. This venture aims to identify significant trends, drivers of change, future scenarios and helpful actions to guide Vietnam’s decision makers through the next wave of digital innovation and industrial transformation.\nThe first report of the project, Vietnam Today (2018), examined the state of Vietnam’s macroeconomy and digital economy in 2018.\n3 5. The push to smart cities: In a rapidly urbanising and ageing nation, smart cities provide opportunities to use infrastructure and resources more efficiently, as well as reduce waste, pollution and traffic congestion."

      "snippet": "disciplines (e.g., engineering, computer science, and urban planning) to identify the potential applications of AI in the three key components of scenario planning: plan generation, scenario generation, and plan evaluation. We then discuss the challenges and possible solutions for integrating AI into the scenario planning process and highlight the critical role of planning experts in this process. We conclude by outlining future research opportunities in this context. Ultimately, this study contributes to the advancement of scenario planning practices and aids the creation of more resilient cities that can thrive in an uncertain future.

Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Higher Education Press Limited Company. [...] Scenario planning is a powerful tool for cities to navigate uncertainties and mitigate the impacts of adverse scenarios by projecting future outcomes based on present-day decisions. This approach is becoming increasingly important given the growing call for building resilient cities to face adverse future scenarios posed by emerging disruptive technologies and climate change. However, conventional scenario planning practices predominantly rely on expert knowledge and judgment, which may be limited in accounting for the complexity of future scenarios. Therefore, we explored the potential integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scenario planning practices. We synthesized related studies from various disciplines (e.g., engineering, computer science, and urban"
