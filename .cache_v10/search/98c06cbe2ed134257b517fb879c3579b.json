      "snippet": "# Student Activities and Organizations\n\nCentre emphasizes student independence, initiative, responsibility, and leadership in the development and enhancement of student co-curricular activities and student organizations. However, the Student Life Office seeks to provide support, encouragement, and advice as needed and desired by the students. The Director of Campus Activities and Greek Life works with groups and their advisors to develop leadership and organizational strength and to help co-curricular life contribute to the enhanced development of students and the educational mission of the institution. Contact the Director of Campus Activities and Greek Life for a current listing of all student organizations. This list is also available on Centre’s website. [...] Students are encouraged to organize and join groups that promote their common interests. A group shall become an official organization when registered by the institution through the Student Life Office and Student Government Association. The College believes in the co-curricular experience and its potential contribution to building community. Centre delegates authority and responsibility for student organization activity along the following line: Board of Trustees, President, Vice President of Student Life, and Dean of Students or designee, and heads of student organizations. [...] Student organizations at Centre College must operate in compliance with college policy and local, State, and Federal law. Organizations must also operate in compliance with their own approved constitution and/or By-Laws. The Student Life Office and/or SGA reserves the right to deny registration or to withdraw registration from any organization whose purpose or activities are deemed inconsistent with the mission, values, or policies of the institution. Organizations must register annually, or as often as requested by the Student Life Office, and must inform the Student Life Office of any changes to the information supplied on the registration form as often as such information may change."
