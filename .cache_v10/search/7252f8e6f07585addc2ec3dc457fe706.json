For example, now the interpreter can suggest standard-library modules in error messages for `NameError`. It can also provide attribute name suggestions when a `NameError` occurs.\n\n`NameError`\n`NameError`\n\nNote: For a deep dive into these improvements and more, head over to Python 3.12 Preview: Ever Better Error Messages.

      "snippet": "As you can see, Python 3 is the most popular version of Python, with a usage share of over 80%. This is because Python 3 is a major revision of the Python language that was released in 2008. Python 3 introduces a number of new features and changes that make it a more modern and powerful language.\n\nPython 2 is the second most popular version of Python, with a usage share of over 15%. Python 2 was released in 2000 and is the older version of the language. Python 2 is still supported by the Python Software Foundation, but it is no longer being actively developed.\n\nOther versions of Python, such as Python 3.1, Python 3.2, and Python 3.3, have a usage share of less than 5%. These versions of Python are no longer supported by the Python Software Foundation and are not recommended for use. [...] If you are new to Python, I recommend that you use Python 3. Python 3 is the future of the Python language and it is the version that is most widely used.\n\nHere is also my little contribution to Python community FREE Interviewing e-book for your next interview preparation The Python Interview Handbook 2023 there you can find more e-books which can help you in getting your next programming role.  \nGumroad  \nMore details about e-books at InterviewBible.com\n\n## Top comments (5)\n\npic\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\ncloutierjo profile image\n\nI guess real time stopped in 2019 since [...] Maker Forem Logo\nMaker Forem Main Image\n\n### Maker Forem\n\nA community for makers, hobbyists, and professionals to discuss Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, and much more.\n\nHMPL.js Forem Logo\nHMPL.js Forem Main Image\n\n### HMPL.js Forem\n\nFor developers using HMPL.js to build fast, lightweight web apps.
