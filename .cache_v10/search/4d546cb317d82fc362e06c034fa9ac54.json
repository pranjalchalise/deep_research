As a result, progress toward immigration policy change has been slow and difficult. But for government affairs professionals, tracking legislative and regulatory updates remains a critical task. [...] Notably, the U.S. also makes permanent immigration a different issue than temporary immigration, and the executive branch is allowed to “exercise statutory or executive authority to allow certain noncitizens to enter or remain in the United States on a time-limited basis, including those who have not been admitted through permanent or temporary pathways under the INA and might otherwise be subject to removal,” with these pathways including TPS and immigration parole, according to Congress."

Trump has focused intensely on immigration, including aggressively pursuing removal of noncitizens, pressuring states and localities to cooperate in immigration enforcement, limiting access to humanitarian forms of relief, and closing the southern border, to name just a few of the myriad actions to date. Through a series of executive orders (EO), policy memoranda, and other actions, the Administration has taken major steps to fundamentally reshape immigration policy and practice that test the limits of executive power, often with the blessing of the Supreme Court."

If required, the fee is not paid when the parole application is submitted to USCIS, but DHS will collect the $1,000 fee after it determines in its discretion that the foreign national will be granted parole and the foreign national appears for inspection at a port of entry to enter the U.S. or is already physically present in the U.S. The 10 exceptions include certain instances involving a medical emergency and related treatment, the foreign national coming to the U.S. to visit a close family member whose death is imminent, the foreign national coming to the U.S. to attend a funeral [...] Skip to content\n\nEvents\n\nNews\n\nOffices\n\nCareers\n\nRefine search by section\n\nNovember 13, 2025\n\n# Immigration: Recent Changes and New Regulations\n\nHolland & Knight Alert\n\nTara L. Vance\n\n## Highlights\n\n The Trump Administration has implemented a number of immigration policy changes and new regulations in recent weeks, including updates to the Diversity Visa Program, Temporary Protected Status, Employment Authorization Document automatic extensions and H-1B Proclamation Fee guidance, among others.\n This Holland & Knight alert provides an overview of these key changes and important details for companies to know in the current immigration landscape.\n\nA closer look at significant immigration-related policy changes and new regulations implemented by the Trump Administration in recent weeks: [...] ## Cessation of Automatic Extension of EADs\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a final rule on Oct. 30, 2025, ending the 540-day automatic extension of EADs for eligible applicants who timely file renewal applications on or after Oct. 30, 2025. This is concerning to many stakeholders because the 540-day automatic extension provided the means pursuant to which businesses were able to continue to employ eligible workers when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) takes six months or longer to process such renewal applications."

      "snippet": "### 9. Facial Recognition and Biometric Checks\n\nEffective December 26, 2025, all non-citizens, including green card holders (Lawful Permanent Residents), will be required to undergo facial and biometric checks at all U.S. air, land, and sea entry and exit points. The new system aims to address visa overstays and identify fraud. The rule also applies to children under 14 and people over 79 years of age, meaning they will also be subject to the checks. [...] Perhaps one of the most sweeping policy changes has been the administration's implementation and enforcement of the Alien Registration Requirement (ARR). This requirement applies to all foreign nationals who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer. Many foreign nationals are deemed \"registered\" if granted certain immigration documents (e.g., visa, Form I-94, green card, EAD, etc.). The most common situations requiring registration within the U.S. involve Canadian citizens who entered the U.S. by land, who must apply for registration by their 30th continuous day in the U.S., as outlined at  and all foreign national children who reach their 14th birthday in the U.S., even if previously registered by their parents or granted a U.S. visa abroad. [...] The U.S. Department of State's (DOS) announcement on June 18, 2025 confirms that U.S. Embassies and Consulates abroad may resume scheduling F, M, and J nonimmigrant visa appointments, including visas for students, scholars, and dependents from most countries. All visa applicants are required to identify their personal social media accounts in the DS-160 nonimmigrant visa application form. Applicants for F, M, and J visas must also update the privacy settings on their social media accounts to \"public\" prior to the interview appointment, as part of strict vetting and screening processes. DOS announced that this same expanded screening will be extended to H-1B applicants and their dependents effective December 15, so H applicants will soon need to update their privacy settings as well."
