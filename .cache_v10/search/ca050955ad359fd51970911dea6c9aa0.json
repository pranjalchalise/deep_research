Researches shows that it is difficult for teachers to address the conflicts on sensitive issue in a way that give spaces for culturally diverse and economically deprived students (King, 2009; Subedi & Stephanie, 2008). Teachers have not the ability to lead the discussion by opposing the contradictory views in a way that develop mutual understanding (Hemmings, 2000). The findings of a research conducted by Dull and Murrow (2008) depicts that teacher question with in the classroom based on recalling of content, they have not the ability to ask analytical question that probe critical thinking among students.

Constructivist theory suggests that previous knowledge of learner needs to connect with new knowledge. Learner construct knowledge by active engagement in the process of learning. Knowledge cannot be passively received but actively (Hein, 2006). This active engagement of learner in the process of acquiring knowledge provide him sustainable learning. Sustainability of knowledge may motivate the individual/learner to exhibit this learning into practice that form the attitude of individual. Figure 2.

For students of color and low-income students, relationships and support within the academic environ-ment are particularly important to academic success (Syed, Azmi-tia, & Cooper, 2011). [...] I think he really had an impact on making me see sociology in a whole other way. Because the way he taught it, he did lecture and he wanted to hear what other students had to say . . . the way he explained it, it was as if you weren’t reading off a textbook. You were listening to what he was saying as if you were in a conversation with him. So that was really like what . . . I gained lots of knowledge from him. I even kept the book, which is something I do not do.\nElena, a 22-year old secondary math education major born in Mexico, viewed two math professors’ emotionally sensitive teach-ing style and availability outside class as important models of math teaching to emulate in her future profession. [...] parents, and also tend to have lower ratings of sense of belonging and satisfaction (Je-hangir, 2010; Stebleton, Soria, & Huesman, 2014). Johnson and colleagues (2007) found African-American, Latinx, and Asian-American Pacific students reported a less strong sense of belong-ing than White students. The significance of belonging for college students is conceptualized in Tinto’s (1993) integration model, which holds that being academically and socially connected to an institution makes students more likely to persist (1993). Research by Karp (2011) supports Tinto’s model, finding that students who do not become connected to their college struggle to remain enrolled."

      "snippet": "Biodiversity is rapidly declining, affecting benefits critical to human well-being, including food production, water quality, climate regulation, and recreation spaces. This decline is particularly challenging in urban and agricultural areas significantly modified by humans but where reliance on biodiversity’s benefits is nevertheless high. We assess the minimum level of (semi-)natural habitat needed in human-modified landscapes to support the supply of these benefits. We find that biodiversity’s capacity to pollinate crops, regulate pests and diseases, maintain clear water, and limit soil erosion significantly declines when habitat area falls below 20%–25% per km2. This same limit applies in urban areas to maintain recreation spaces for people. We find that approximately two-thirds of [...] ## Summary [...] ## Graphical abstract\n\n## Keywords\n\nfunctional integrity\n\nbiodiversity\n\necosystem services\n\nNature’s Contributions to People\n\nhuman-modified landscapes\n\npollination\n\npest and disease control\n\nsoil conservation\n\nwater quality regulation\n\nrecreation\n\n## Cited by (0)\n\n12\n:   X (formerly Twitter): @awazmsm\n\n13\n:   Lead contact\n\n© 2023 The Authors.
