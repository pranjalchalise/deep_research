      "snippet": "the power of keeping one's opinion to oneself and the benefits of detachment in leadership. The speakers also discuss the concept of extreme ownership and how to take ownership in tough situations. They emphasize the importance of taking extreme ownership in order to improve situations and overcome barriers. The podcast does not provide any promotional content. [...] And to think about is number one or do we really want to frame our planning sessions as people winning versus people losing? And listen, I've known thousands have I known thousands? I won't put a number. I've known many, many, many people that they relish winning with their idea. They relish when their idea is the winning idea, when they frame it that way as a victory.\n\nAnd look there, we could probably do a whole another podcast about how do you contend with people like that, that they've got the winning idea. And there's, I mean, it's pretty obvious what you're gonna do. You can take the indirect approach, you're gonna ask this question, you're gonna make them think that your idea is their idea and then they think that they're the greatest thing ever. [...] So as you are trying to explain to them over and over and over again instead, once that meter goes into the red, why don't you stop talking and start listening, stop talking and start listening. I said on an early podcast that I have a limit for beating my head against the wall.\n\nIt's 47 times. So if I bang my head against the wall 47 times, you don't go 48. 47 is the max. Like you're trying to get something done. You're trying to beat your head against the wall, you're trying to convince my Don't go 48 times. Keep it at 47.\n\nThis is the same thing, like how frustrated, how annoyed, how irritated should you get?\n\nTrying to explain your brilliant plan to your boss, to your peer, to your subordinate, to your wife, to your husband, to your kid.\n\nYou actually shouldn't get that frustrated."
