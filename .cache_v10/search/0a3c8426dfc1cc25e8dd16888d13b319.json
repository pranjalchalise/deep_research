      "snippet": "May 30, 2025\n\nU.S. immigration continues to be one of the most hotly contested issues on the Hill and in statehouses across the country because it impacts a wide swath of communities in every corner of America.\n\nFor more than a decade, high-profile members of Congress – Democrats and Republicans alike – have called for changes to border policy, but disagree on how to get there and what success looks like. As a result, progress toward immigration policy change has been slow and difficult. But for government affairs professionals, tracking legislative and regulatory updates remains a critical task. [...] ### Economic and workforce implications\n\nTrump and many of his allies argue that immigrants are lowering wages and taking jobs from native-born Americans. And other critics argue that by creating demand for more goods and services, thereby stimulating the economy, immigration also can add to inflation.\n\nIn addition, some Republicans have argued the recent immigration surge worsened the cost-of-living crisis, with Vice President JD Vance claiming undocumented immigrants are to blame for a “totally unaffordable” housing market. [...] As of April 2025, at least one of these orders is facing legal challenges, as Democratic states and immigration groups have put forth numerous legal challenges on the order relating to birthright citizenship, and a federal district court has temporarily blocked the order from taking effect.\n\nBut, in the meantime, if these executive orders are enforced and implemented, Trump immigration policy will restructure U.S. immigration policy in meaningful ways to focus mainly on enforcement.\n\n## The impact of immigration reform\n\nImmigration policy changes could have implications for the economy and workforce. Immigrants are a core part of the U.S. economy, as they work, spend money, pay taxes, have children, and do other things (like native-born Americans) to keep the economy growing."

      "snippet": "If you're planning to immigrate to the United States in 2025, understanding the potential changes in immigration policies is crucial. With a new administration led by President-elect Donald Trump, significant shifts in U.S. immigration laws are expected. These changes could impact individuals and businesses navigating the complex immigration system. Based on past policies during Trump's first term and recent developments, experts anticipate updates that may tighten visa requirements, affect asylum seekers, and reshape employment-based immigration. This blog explores the most critical updates and predictions for U.S. immigration policy in 2025, offering insights to help you stay informed and prepared. Whether you're applying for a visa, seeking asylum, or managing a business dependent on [...] Family Separation and Mass Deportations: The reinstatement of family separation policies and large-scale deportation efforts may create significant social and emotional disruptions for immigrant families.\n Severe Restrictions on Asylum: Limiting access to asylum at the border could leave thousands of vulnerable individuals without legal protection or support.\n Restructuring Immigration Agencies: Plans to overhaul immigration agencies may lead to more centralized authority and streamlined, but stricter, decision-making processes.\n Reduced Legal Immigration Channels: Cutting back on pathways for legal immigration could affect family reunifications, employment-based visas, and diversity visa programs. [...] Expanded Executive Authority: Shifting more power to the executive branch over immigration matters may fast-track policies but limit checks and balances.\n Cuts to Immigration Legal Assistance: Reducing funding for immigration legal aid could make it harder for individuals and families to navigate the already complex immigration system.\n Deportations Without Due Process: Allowing deportations without court hearings or warrants could lead to legal and ethical challenges.\n Stricter Quotas and Rules for Immigration Judges: Imposing rigid quotas and stricter rules may create additional bottlenecks in an already overwhelmed immigration court system."

      "snippet": "The 10-year policy (Table 3B) extends deportation through 2034, increasing outlays by $561.4 billion over ten years. These new required outlays are in addition to the $170 billion already allocated in the 2025 OBBBA for enhanced border security, interior enforcement, and deportation. With a greater reduction in population compared to the 4-year policy, the loss in revenue grows proportionately to the number of unauthorized immigrants no longer paying taxes. Revenues would decline by $300.4 billion from 2025 to 2034. Primary deficits would increase by more $861.8 billion over the 10-year budget window. With dynamic effects, primary deficits increase to $986.8 billion.\n\nEconomic Effects\n\nTable 4 presents the economic impacts of both deportation policies. [...] Policies: We examine two distinct policy scenarios regarding the deportation of unauthorized immigrants: (i) A 4-year policy where 10 percent of unauthorized immigrants are removed annually over four years (2025 – 2028), with unauthorized immigration returning to baseline levels in 2029; (ii) A 10-year policy where 10 percent of unauthorized immigrants are removed each year for a period of ten years, ultimately removing all unauthorized immigrants and preventing the entry of new unauthorized immigrants thereafter. In both scenarios, immigration laws concerning authorized workers remain unchanged. [...] Population Size\n\nWithout the mass deportation policies, including those policies in the 2025 OBBBA, Table 1 shows that the population is projected to rise from 337.2 million at the end of 2025 to 379 million by 2054, with the number of unauthorized immigrants projected to increase from 11.5 million in 2025 to 12.3 million in 2054.1\n\nTable 1: Change in Population Sizes under the Deportation Policies\n\n(in millions of people)"

      "snippet": "Most visible by far was the campaign for mass deportations. The administration pledged to remove 1 million unauthorized immigrants per year (although the total in 2025 will likely be closer to 600,000), and it corralled virtually every arm of the sprawling U.S. federal government to assist. Officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and other agencies were surged to U.S. cities from coast to coast, engaging in high-profile and often confrontational operations in neighborhoods, workplaces, and previously off-limits locations including schools and faith-based organizations. Congress allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years, transforming it into the largest federal law enforcement agency and prompting a quick scaling-up of [...] As result of this shift in tone, many immigrants’ fear their relationship with their adopted country is changing. Large numbers of immigrants—including many naturalized citizens—told pollsters they feared being arrested and deported, and modified their daily habits to be less visible. Enrollment of new international students at U.S. universities dropped by 17 percent in fall 2025 compared to the prior year, as many opted for other destinations (see Item 4. As Labor Demands Rise amid Demographic Change, Under-the-Radar Policies Seek to Fill Gaps). International travel to the United States also appeared to decline, for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. [...] As political leaders in Europe and the United States race to limit border arrivals and expand returns of already present irregular immigrants, they may at some point feel the downstream economic consequences of actions that are not accompanied by expanded legal pathways for in-demand workers. Declining unauthorized immigration could have resulted in as much as a 1 percent reduction in U.S. economic growth in 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates.\n\n## 8.

      "title": "The Fiscal Impact of Immigration (2025 Update) - Manhattan Institute",
      "snippet": "Among the fiscally negative immigrant categories (Figure 26), parents of U.S. citizens are the most notable—each of them is expected to cost taxpayers $850,000 over 30 years, much more than a less educated unlawful immigrant. Undocumented farmworkers, often the subject of much attention by lawmakers seeking to grant amnesty, are the second most fiscally negative group, costing the federal government $360,000 over 30 years. The EB-3 “Other Worker” subcategory of visas for 10,000 unskilled laborers per year is also a significant fiscal drag, with each EB-3 OW immigrant costing nearly $270,000 over 30 years. Extended family members of U.S. citizens and green-card holders—all F-1, F-2, F-3, and F-4 visa categories—cost a net $24,000 over 30 years. [...] The population effect of adding one 20-year-old immigrant begins above one in the first year because some immigrants immediately have children, but then the effect falls for all because of emigration and death. This holds true until fertility overcomes the dip by the end of the 30-year period for immigrants without a college education. (However, if we project the population impact beyond 30 years, which the figure does not illustrate, it will once again fall below one for all except immigrants without a high school diploma, as every other group has below-replacement fertility.) Population impact matters because if there is a negative effect on assimilation and culture from increasing the share of Americans who are foreign-born or their children, then shifting the immigration flow from [...] The economic-impact differences between the two groups of immigrants shrinks by the end of the 30-year budget window because of higher fertility among the less educated, which produces more workers by the end of the 30-year period. This trend likely flips the impact in favor of the less educated group beyond the 30-year period, relative to immigrants with some college and just a high school diploma, but not relative to college graduates.\n\nThe Role of Age"
