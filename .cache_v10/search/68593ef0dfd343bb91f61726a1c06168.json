As a transfer student who has benefited from mentorship, she values supporting others in their career journeys which is one of the main reasons she became a PCA. [...] At Amherst, I’m involved in research with the Chemistry department on energy transfer using quantum dots for different applications. Since freshman year, I’ve been involved in research with the Spanish/LLAS department on community filmmaking in Latin America. On campus I’m a member of La Causa, La Fe, and Questbridge. Last semester, I attended the American Educational Research Association’s international conference in Philadelphia. This summer I had the pleasure of doing a research internship at UPenn in the Mechanical/Chemical Engineering department.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature, baking, watching Netflix, and getting boba with friends. [...] I am a member of the Amherst Women’s Cross Country and Track and Field team. When I am not running, you can often find me in the music building or the science center, as I am a member of the Glee Club and Concert Choir while co-leading the Mammoth MakerLab Club. For the past two years, I have been a member of the Education Professions group and enjoy having meaningful discussions and workshops with my peers. In my free time, I also love hiking, biking, reading, and spending time with my family and friends."
