      "snippet": "skills across different media also caused students to become disengaged during learning and eventually drop out of school (Buchholz et al., 2020). These actions have placed U.S. students at a disadvantage by not having adequate skills for pursuing postsecondary options. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have been facing challenges with implementing relevant curricula for CCR instructional practice in CTE classrooms. Even before the pandemic, e-learning tools played a crucial role in education. Throughout the pandemic, these tools were helpful to student learning during closure of universities and schools (Subedi et al., 2020). Different subjects and age groups require different approaches to online learning (Doucet et al., 2020). Online learning changed how some students with physical [...] for several years. They should consider staggered goals.” T6 reported: 60 Implement indicators that allow for early identification of students who may need additional support in preparing for college and career pathways. Early intervention strategies can help address gaps in skills and knowledge before graduation. Support and promote individualized learning pathways that cater to students' diverse interests, aptitudes, and career goals. Recognize that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective in preparing students for varied postsecondary opportunities. Engage parents, families, and the community in the CCR process. Communication and collaboration with these stakeholders can contribute to a supportive environment for students as they explore and pursue postsecondary options. [...] study was to examine how teachers’ implementation of CCR in CTE courses was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. My goal was to prepare more students for postsecondary success. Based on findings from this case study, I developed professional development training to address the needs of teachers. Development of the project was based on themes which emerged from the data analysis process: experiences transitioning to online classes, skills gaps in learning, 67 motivation versus lack of motivation, Zoom and Google classrooms, lack of support for postsecondary transition, lack of hands-on experiences, funding and resources, and professional development for CCR. The project was developed to provide research-based strategies for properly implementing CTE state standards at the high school"

      "snippet": "Q1.  Why did you choose engineering or surveying?\n\nI chose engineering due to my loves of both chemistry and mathematics when I was in grade school. I was always a very good student in these subjects and took many of the advanced classes in High School and competed in many of the math and science competitions. When deciding what engineering degree to pursue, it was natural towards chemical engineering. As I was obtaining my engineering degree, I also found myself gravitating to the environmental direction of chemical engineering and taking few environmental courses as extra-curricular courses which certainly helped me in my professional career goals of becoming a licensed professional environmental engineer. [...] Rabeea W. Bazuhair, Ben C. Cox, Jesse D. Doyle, Jonathan Easterling, Jessica V. Lewis, Alex Middleton, Carl Pittman, Braden T. Smith, Abhinash Subedi, W. Griffin Sullivan.\"\n\nQ5. Why is professional licensure important to you?\n\n\"Professional licensure helps protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.  Professional licensure is also a lifelong process through which licensed professionals continue to stay current in their field.  Licensure is one of several ways that engineers and surveyors can better themselves and in turn improve people’s lives.\"\n\n---\n\n#### June 2025 Engineer Spotlight: Kayla Erickson, PE [...] \"It may sound corny, but I feel more like engineering chose me.  From an early age I wanted to understand how things worked.  My dad had me working and building alongside him with every project he had at home, and over time that desire to learn and understand how things worked just continued to grow and grow.  He was a great teacher.  In junior high, I joined the Technology Student Association under my shop teacher, Sgt. Arthur Miller, and found a group of friends that shared my interests.  That group of friends pushed each other to do better and better every year, competing in local and statewide contests all the way through high school.  I was hooked.  That group produced 6 engineers that have all excelled in their chosen engineering specialties.  Through Boy Scouts, I also had the"
