      "snippet": "Cultural Transmission of Information in Genetic Programming Lee Spector y lspector@hampshire.edu School of Cognitive Science and Cultural Studies Hampshire College Amherst, MA 01002 Sean Luke y seanl@cs.umd.edu yDepartment of Computer Science University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 ABSTRACT This paper shows how the performance of a genetic programming system can be improved through the addition of mechanisms for non-genetic transmission of information between in-dividuals (culture). Teller has previously shown how genetic programming systems can be en-hanced through the addition of memory mecha-nisms for individual programs [Teller 1994]; in this paper we show how Teller’s memory mech-anism can be changed to allow for communica-tion between individuals within and across [...] Cultural Transmission of Information in Genetic Programming by Lee Spector and Sean Luke Full citation: Spector, L., and S. Luke. 1996. Cultural Transmission of Information in Genetic Programming. In Koza, John R., Goldberg, David E., Fogel, David B., and Riolo, Rick L. (editors) Genetic Programming 1996: Proceedings of the First Annual Conference, 209-214. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. [...] The version of Wumpus world used in this experiment dif-fers from that used in previous work [Spector 1996]; while re-implementing the system in C we made other changes as well. In particular, the new version operates on a true 6-by-6 world. In the old version the world’s “walls” occupied space so the actual playing area in a “6-by-6” world was only 4-by-4. In addition, the old version charged an agent an ex-plicit 100-point penalty for dying. In the new version the only penalty for death is implicit—after one dies one can no longer get closer to the gold or pick it up."

      "snippet": "Within evolutionary computation, I work primarily on genetic programming, which leverages random variation and selection to produce computer programs that solve specified problems. My students and I have made contributions both to the development of new genetic programming techniques and to the application of those techniques to difficult problems. Among the former are the Push programming language, which is a language not for human programmers but for evolutionary processes, and the lexicase selection algorithm for determining which programs should be reproduced, mutated, and recombined in order to solve problems most reliably and quickly. We have worked on applications in areas ranging from pure mathematics and quantum computer programming to wind turbine modeling and music composition. [...] Spector, L. 2003.
