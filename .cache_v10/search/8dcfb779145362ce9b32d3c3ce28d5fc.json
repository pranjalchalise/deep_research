But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020)\n\n“A surreal utopia where friends turned into F.R.I.E.N.D.S, and fanatics into professionals. Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] Cities Reached\n\nStudents Connected\n\nTotal Projects\n\n0\n\n## Highlighted Projects\n\n 2020 - Computer Science\n\n  ## Drishti Nepal\n\n  Drishti is an android based mobile application that recognizes different Nepalese currency notes and gives its audio output.
