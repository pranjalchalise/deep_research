      "snippet": "Developers can use them to create highly functional Graphic User Interface (GUI). 2D imaging software like Inkscape and GIMP use Python. 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Cinema 4D, and Maya use Python in variable proportions.\n\nNumerous scientific and computational applications are built using Python. The power and versatility of Python made it an obvious choice for scientific endeavors. As a result, there are now many complex applications in the area of science:\n\nSciPy: A collection of packages particularly for mathematics, engineering and science.\n\nPandas: A library for data analysis and modeling.\n\nIPython: A powerful shell that you can use for editing and record work sessions. The best part about it is that it also supports visualizations and parallel computing. [...] What is Python mainly used for?\n\nPython is mainly used as a quick scripting language. Though Python itself is intended as a general purpose programming language, it is typically used to create quick, small batch scripts, application plugins, web software plugins, full-scale software, web scripts, to even embedded programming with smaller python implementations.\n\nPython suits this because the language itself resembles pseudocode. Python also uses alot less lines of code to do similar behavior in Java, C++, and C which has given Python a special spot as a prototyping language. Thus you can test out a piece of code you’ve been planning out and then implement it in the language you want to use. [...] Business and Enterprise Application\n\nPython has some fantastic features like special libraries, scalability, extensibility, and syntax that is easily readable. Larger applications can easily be customized using a coding language like Python. The popular web application Reddit was first created using Common Lips but later in 2005 was rewritten using Python. Python also played a significant role in the functionality of YouTube.\n\nPython\n\nOperating Systems\n\nPython is used a lot in Linux distributions. For example, Ubuntu’s Ubiquity Installer, Anaconda Installer from Red Hat Enterprise and Fedora are all written using Python. Gentoo Linux also used Python for Portage, its package management systems.\n\nLanguage Development"
