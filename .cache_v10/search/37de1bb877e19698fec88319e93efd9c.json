      "snippet": "Answer: You should list your GPA if it is 3.5 or higher, or if the employer asks for it in the application. If your GPA is lower, that is completely fine. You can focus on highlighting relevant coursework, projects, or other academic accomplishments instead.\n\n### 4. “How many experiences should I include?”\n\nAnswer: A good goal is to include three to five experiences that feel most relevant to the roles you are applying for. These do not have to be jobs. Research, leadership roles, class projects, and volunteer experiences can all be great to include if they show your skills and strengths. It is always better to have a few strong experiences than a long list with little detail.\n\n### 5. “How can my resume stand out?” [...] ### 2. “How do I write a strong experience section?”\n\nAnswer: Keep your bullet points simple and clear. Start each one with an action verb, focus on what you achieved, and highlight the skills you used. Aim for one to three bullets for each experience. A helpful way to write these is to think: What did I do, how did I do it, and why did it matter?\n\nYou can also use the STAR Method, which stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. It is a great tool for explaining your impact in a structured way. You can learn more about the STAR Method in the Loeb Center’s How-To Guides.\n\n### 3. “Should I include my GPA and what counts as a good one?” [...] Homepage\n\n# 5 Most Commonly Asked Questions I Get About Resumes as a Peer Career Advisor\n\n### 1. “What do employers actually look for in a resume?”\n\nAnswer: Employers want to quickly understand who you are, what you have done, and why you might be a good fit. They look for clarity, relevant experience, real impact, and clean formatting. The strongest resumes show results, like “increased engagement by 20%,” instead of just listing tasks.\n\nIt also really helps to read the job description closely and tailor your resume to match what the employer is asking for. Showing that you understand what they need makes a big difference.\n\n### 2. “How do I write a strong experience section?”"
