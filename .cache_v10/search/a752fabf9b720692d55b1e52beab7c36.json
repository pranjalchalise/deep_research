      "snippet": "today you are an aspiring junior and the rest will come a big part of many junior web developer roles is taking designs and converting them into responsive websites why then would the employer care if you're good at design your job isn't to design the website is to convert the copy and i think if you want to be good at design most employers will recognize that you are going to sort of absorb that knowledge as you work on more projects with experienced designers but it could also be that you don't even want to be good at design maybe your passion is more on the behavior or interactivity side the javascript side of web development and in that case it's not even reasonable to expect that you'd be good at design this is where the template argument comes in because if you don't have design [...] really think that if you've graduated and that is no small feat and you've paid for the privilege you might as well milk it for what it's worth and talk quite prominently about your degree is that could just be a green light for some employers even though that sounds unfair for self-taught people i don't think it hurts you if you don't have a degree i'm just saying if you have it you might as well take advantage of it again karen includes a skill list which i totally support the only one small bit of feedback i would offer despite this beautiful presentation is to add the technology names beneath the logos because a non-technical person is going to look at this and think it's a leaf and think what is that not knowing it's probably for db it just so happens that a friend of ours is [...] this to me feels like a great project because it solves a specific problem that person can tell a story around the problem it also feels more like a real not real app but it feels more like a project or a product versus a utility and that's what makes it like a really great project but the truth is everybody's at a different place not all junior developer jobs are made equal if your project falls on either end or in between that spectrum i think it's a good project for your portfolio the most important thing honestly is that you apply some degree of polish like ideally it's going to be responsive maybe you'll deploy it no matter what i feel like it should look relatively polished another question you could ask yourself is you know where did you get stuck and how did you overcome that if"
