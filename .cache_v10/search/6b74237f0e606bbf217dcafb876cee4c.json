      "snippet": "Lee Spector is a Professor of computer science at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA. He received a BA in philosophy from Oberlin College and a PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland. His areas of interest include evolutionary computation, quantum com-putation, and the intersections between computer science, cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and the arts. He is a member of the ACM Special Interest Group on Evolution-ary Computation (SIGEVO) Executive Committee and is a Fellow of the International Society for Genetic and Evolu-tionary Computation. He serves on the editorial boards of Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines and Evolu-tionary Computation.\nL. Spector 184 [...] In the next two articles we see how genetic programming can be applied to problems in two different areas of electro-magnetic design, antennas and optics. Jason D.

[...] VOLUME 22 SUMMER 2008 NUMBER 3 SPECIAL ISSUE Genetic Programming for Human-Competitive Designs Guest Editor LEE SPECTOR GUEST EDITORIAL Introduction to the Special Issue on genetic programming for human-competitive designs LEE SPECTOR School of Cognitive Science, Hampshire College, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA Readers of this journal are familiar with many ways in which computers aid designers, often serving as design tools or even as design assistants. This Special Issue of Artificial Intelli-gence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing concerns recent work that aims to further expand the function of computers in design, to the point at which computers are useful as designers in their own right."
