      "snippet": "No, the speed difference is due to dynamic (Python) versus static (Java) bindings. Everytime Python wants to call a function, it has to take the function name, as a string, and lookup that string in a dictionary to find the actual function to call. It has to do this every time, because every object might be patched with different functions at runtime. Java, on the other hand, can very quickly find the address of the function to call by simply looking in the Nth slot in it’s virtual method table. C/C++ is even faster, since the address of the function is known at linker time (unless you opt to use virtual functions). [...] In Python there is 'one way to solve a problem'. On the other end, in C++ there are way more ways to solve the same problem. This added choice can distract you from solving the problem.\n Java has the best IDE support (e.g. eclipse or IntelliJ)\n C and C++ are also statically typed, but the preprocessor can add a level of complexity that can make it difficult to be sure what actually happens.\n In terms of speed C/C++ are fastest, but for most problems Java is very close in speed. Python can be slow, but if needed critical parts can be written in C. On modern execution speed is rarely the limit - cache behaviour, memory and disc access are the limits. [...] While a python program might perform worse than an equivalent java program, Python is faster to write, saving times for programmers to optimize their codes on crucial parts using various techniques.\n\nOptimized to its limit, java gonna be faster than pure Python.

      "snippet": "However, it’s crucial to consider the broader context. Python’s design prioritizes simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for rapid development and prototyping. While Java and C++ outperform Python in terms of speed, Python’s ease of use, extensive libraries, and community support continue to secure its place as a favored option in many application domains.\n\n## Get Muralikrishnan Rajendran’s stories in your inbox\n\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer. [...] ## Conclusion:\n\nThe execution speed disparity between Python and its compiled counterparts, Java and C++, is attributed to several factors rooted in their design philosophies and implementation. Python’s interpreted nature, less efficient memory management, lack of runtime optimizations, and dynamic type system collectively contribute to its slower execution speed.\n\n> “So, you’re telling me Python is like the tortoise, and Java and C++ are like the hares? I read a fable about this once, but with all this ‘Unraveling the Speed Disparity’ talk, it sounds more like unraveling a giant ball of yarn — and not the fun kind you play with! Can we just say Python likes to take its sweet time and enjoys the scenic route?” 🐢🏞️ [...] In this Python example, a for loop is used to print numbers from 0 to 9. Unlike C++ or Java, Python’s standard interpreter, CPython, executes bytecode in a straightforward manner without the extensive optimizations seen in compiled languages or the JVM. This loop iterates and executes each step line-by-line, leading to typically slower execution. However, alternative Python implementations like PyPy can improve execution speed significantly through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, translating Python code into machine code at runtime and applying various optimizations to enhance performance.\n\n## 4. Type System\n\n### C++:\n\nC++ uses a static type system, ensuring type safety and allowing optimizations during compile time."

In many cases, a prototype of an application can be written in Python without writing any C/C++/Java code. Often, the prototype is sufficiently functional and performs well enough to be delivered as the final product, saving considerable development time. Other times, the prototype can be translated in part or in whole to C++ or Java -- Python's object-oriented nature makes the translation a straightforward process.\n\nHas this issue been properly scientifically evaluated?

However I wanted to add that in my opinion the advantages of Python towards C++ and Java are plenty of syntax sugars. Take three common ones: auto-typing (even don't need to use `auto`), generic-by-default (don't need to wrap every function with `template<...>`), list comprehension. Syntax sugars are the second advantage, and the first advantage I think is a fast-responding community - see how many PEPs are made. Python is growing quickly, but C++ etc. are growing in years.
