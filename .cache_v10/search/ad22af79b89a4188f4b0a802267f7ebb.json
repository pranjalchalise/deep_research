      "snippet": "VJs is renowned for its Simplicity and ease of integration into existing projects and it has a very gentle learning curve and it makes it makes it accessible to developers with varying levels of experience and it allows them to quickly get started and become productive rather than learning something like angular and I don't mean to trash angular but it is a very difficult framework to learn and it's going to take you a lot more time to start building stuff so flexibility VJs is designed to be incrementally adoptable again that means that you can introduce it into your projects gradually and whether you need to build a small widget or a full-fledged single page application VJs scales effortlessly and uh it it allows you to meet very diverse project requirements next we have performance and [...] I know from his bio and the reason that I I like to mention that is because I think that the fact that Vue wasn't created by a Google or a Facebook or any other Tech Giant like most of the front-end Frameworks were and the fact that it still has the popularity that it has I think that speaks volumes about the framework and about its quality and about its Community now as far as prerequisites a lot of people ask me when am I ready to learn a framework and the answer to that is a tough one because everyone has a different learning ability and different ways that they like to learn I know people that learn JavaScript at the same time that they learned react or view however I don't think that's the optimal way to do it for most people I think you should first learn the building blocks HTML [...] server side rendered applications and then gridsome is a static site generator that uses view it's comparable to Gatsby and react so these Frameworks have their own tools to get set up and they're definitely things that I think you should check out but I always suggest learning the core framework first and learn how to build single page applications then move on to you know SSR and and SSG so that's it for slides now we're going to jump in and like I said I'm just going to show you real quick how to use view with the CDN and then we can jump in and use create view all right guys so this is the vue.js documentation which is pretty good and I'd suggest just keeping it open as a supplement to to this crash course and you can check things out there's obviously going to be stuff in here we're"

      "snippet": "|  |  |\n --- |\n| Prerequisites: | Familiarity with the core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages, knowledge of the terminal/command line.  Vue components are written as a combination of JavaScript objects that manage the app's data and an HTML-based template syntax that maps to the underlying DOM structure. For installation, and to use some of the more advanced features of Vue (like Single File Components or render functions), you'll need a terminal with node + npm installed. |\n| Objective: | To learn where to go to find further information on Vue, to continue your learning. |\n\n## Further resources\n\nHere's where you should go to learn more about Vue: [...] Vue Docs — The main Vue site. Contains comprehensive documentation, including examples, cookbooks, and reference material. This is the best place to start learning Vue in depth.\n Vue GitHub Repo — The Vue code itself. This is where you can report issues and/or contribute directly to the Vue codebase. Studying the Vue source code can help you better understand how the framework works, and write better code.\n Vue Discussions — The official forum for getting help with Vue.\n Vue CLI Docs — Documentation for the Vue CLI. This contains information on customizing and extending the output you are generating via the CLI. [...] Skip to search\n\nToggle sidebar \n\n1. Learn\n2. Core learning modules\n3.

The rest of the documentation will provide code samples in both styles where applicable, and you can toggle between them at any time using the API Preference switches at the top of the left sidebar.\n\n## Still Got Questions? ​\n\nCheck out our FAQ.\n\n## Pick Your Learning Path ​\n\nDifferent developers have different learning styles. Feel free to pick a learning path that suits your preference - although we do recommend going over all of the content, if possible!\n\nTry the Tutorial\n\nFor those who prefer learning things hands-on.Read the Guide\n\nThe guide walks you through every aspect of the framework in full detail.Check out the Examples\n\nExplore examples of core features and common UI tasks.\n\nEdit this page on GitHub [...] You can learn more about the comparison between the two styles and the potential benefits of Composition API in the Composition API FAQ.\n\nIf you are new to Vue, here's our general recommendation:\n\n For learning purposes, go with the style that looks easier to understand to you. Again, most of the core concepts are shared between the two styles. You can always pick up the other style later.\n For production use:\n\n  + Go with Options API if you are not using build tools, or plan to use Vue primarily in low-complexity scenarios, e.g. progressive enhancement.\n  + Go with Composition API + Single-File Components if you plan to build full applications with Vue. [...] Despite the flexibility, the core knowledge about how Vue works is shared across all these use cases. Even if you are just a beginner now, the knowledge gained along the way will stay useful as you grow to tackle more ambitious goals in the future. If you are a veteran, you can pick the optimal way to leverage Vue based on the problems you are trying to solve, while retaining the same productivity. This is why we call Vue \"The Progressive Framework\": it's a framework that can grow with you and adapt to your needs.\n\n## Single-File Components ​"
