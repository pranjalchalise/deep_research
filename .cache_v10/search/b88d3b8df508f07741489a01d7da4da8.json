No OS updates. → Just Intelligence. 💡 Apple’s Siri no longer just assists — it thinks, powered by Apple Intelligence and, when needed, OpenAI’s ChatGPT. 💡 Gemini isn’t just Android’s sidekick anymore — it’s the brain for billions of devices, quietly learning your tone, patterns, even your emotion. 💡 And the ChatGPT Platform? → It’s no longer a chatbot — it’s where your Spotify, Canva, and Calendar all live inside AI.
