      "snippet": "As of April 2025, at least one of these orders is facing legal challenges, as Democratic states and immigration groups have put forth numerous legal challenges on the order relating to birthright citizenship, and a federal district court has temporarily blocked the order from taking effect.\n\nBut, in the meantime, if these executive orders are enforced and implemented, Trump immigration policy will restructure U.S. immigration policy in meaningful ways to focus mainly on enforcement.\n\nThe impact of immigration reform\n\nImmigration policy changes could have implications for the economy and workforce. Immigrants are a core part of the U.S. economy, as they work, spend money, pay taxes, have children, and do other things (like native-born Americans) to keep the economy growing. [...] During his first term, the Trump administration enacted a series of actions that shifted immigration policy. And when he took office again in January 2025, after campaigning to initiate “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” he rolled out several new executive orders on immigration policy, related to: [...] And the “U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 47.8 million in 2023, an increase of 1.6 million from the previous year,” according to the Pew report, which noted that this is the largest annual increase in more than 20 years, since 2000.\n\nImmigration reform proposals for 2025\n\nThe proposals for immigration reform in 2025 are related to President Donald Trump’s position on immigration and his calls for “mass deportation,” restrictions on asylum access, and border reform.\n\nImage 2\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and U.S. Vice President JD Vance speak to members of the media at the U.S.-Mexico border on March 5, 2025.

      "snippet": "(Last Updated January 26, 2026)\n\nIn his second administration, President Donald J. Trump has focused intensely on immigration, including aggressively pursuing removal of noncitizens, pressuring states and localities to cooperate in immigration enforcement, limiting access to humanitarian forms of relief, and closing the southern border, to name just a few of the myriad actions to date. Through a series of executive orders (EO), policy memoranda, and other actions, the Administration has taken major steps to fundamentally reshape immigration policy and practice that test the limits of executive power, often with the blessing of the Supreme Court.

      "snippet": "#### Expanding the inhumane detention system\n\nImmigration detention has massively expanded since January 2025, with daily detention populations now over 60,000 people. Immigrants are detained under inhumane conditions in makeshift camps, former military bases, private prisons, and federal prison facilities. Many operate without adequate monitoring or accountability, as government oversight offices have been shut down. During Trump’s first year in office, at least 32 people have died in ICE custody.  \n\n#### Conducting raids in schools, hospitals, and other sensitive areas [...] #### Suspending refugee admissions\n\nTrump suspended the refugee program for all countries except for white Afrikaaners from South Africa. Thousands of refugees who had already been approved for admission—some already in transit to the U.S.—have been stranded in countries around the world. That includes hundreds of Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war in Afghanistan and now fear for their lives.     \n\nFollowing a December 2025 shooting of National Guard troops, reportedly by an Afghan national, the administration halted all visas for Afghan nationals indefinitely. It also paused all asylum decisions, regardless of nationality.  \n\n#### Implementing a new travel ban [...] #### Attempts to end birthright citizenship\n\nThrough an executive order, the Trump administration is attempting to revoke citizenship from some U.S.-born children of immigrants. This right is protected by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. More than 20 states have filed suit to challenge the order and uphold this fundamental right. More than one federal judge has already temporarily blocked the executive order, calling it “blatantly unconstitutional.\"  The case will now be heard by  the U.S. Supreme Court, with arguments likely in spring 2026.  \n\n### \n\n### TACTICS TO CONTROL AND SILENCE\n\n#### Creating a nationwide registry to target immigrants"
