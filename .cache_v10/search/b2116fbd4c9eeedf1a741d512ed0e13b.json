      "snippet": "Chapter 1 GENETIC PROGRAMMING WITH HISTORICALLY ASSESSED HARDNESS Jon Klein1 and Lee Spector1 1Cognitive Science, Hampshire College, Amherst, MA USA 01002-3359 Abstract We present a variation of the genetic programming algorithm, called Histor-ically Assessed Hardness (HAH), in which the ﬁtness rewards for particular test cases are scaled in proportion to their relative difﬁculty as gauged by historical solution rates. The method is similar in many respects to some realizations of techniques such as implicit ﬁtness sharing, stepwise adaptation of weights and ﬁtness case selection, but the details differ and HAH is generally simpler and more efﬁcient. It also leads to different generalizations. We present results from large-scale, systematic tests of HAH and we also discuss the technique in [...] In Spector, Lee, Goodman, Erik D., Wu, Annie, Langdon, W.
