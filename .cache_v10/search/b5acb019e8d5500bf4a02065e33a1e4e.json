      "snippet": "Together with the President of Save the Children Italy Claudio Tesauro, Jean-Christophe Babin visited the Charity’s various humanitarian and education programs, including daily bread distribution to the entire population of the camp. The most rewarding part of the visit was when he spent time in two of the three pre-schools built by Bvlgari and Save the Children where specially-trained educators run high-quality early childhood education programs for almost 4,000 children aged 3 to 4. Immersed in an expanse of white prefabricated buildings and tents, these kindergartens allow children to discover the colors of the world. [...] The Bvlgari Save the Children jewellery collection comprising of the pendant necklace, bracelet and ring is available at all Bvlgari boutiques in sterling silver with black ceramic accents.\n\n### About Author\n\n### Related Posts\n\n## New: Piaget Polo 79 Two-Tone\n\n## New: Hanhart 417 ES Moby Dick 39 mm: The Civil Version\n\n## New: H. Moser Endeavour Tourbillon Skeleton\n\n### 2 Comments\n\nI looked to see if I could identify the watch that Mr. Babin was wearing then realised that it was in bad taste to do so! [...] “Nine years ago, we embarked on a partnership with Save the Children with an audacious dream: to help empower millions of children to build a better future for themselves through the power of education.” – says Bvlgari CEO Jean Christophe Babin. “Because we know that just like a precious piece of jewelery, a wish is first imagined. Almost a decade later, we are proud of the dream we had – and the audacity we have shown with Save the Children in making it real: helping over a million children dream great. Now we move forward. With ambition, with audacity of hope, with a commitment to excellence, and steadfast determination to make many more wishes come true. Because a dream can last forever when it’s #madereal.”"
