Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad(2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] ## Shreeansh Agrawal\n\n  Shreeansh double majored in Mathematics and Art History at Amherst College and constantly has one foot in each boat.

The old Android vs iOS debate? → Over. The new race is Apple vs Google vs OpenAI — → A race to own your intelligence layer. And if that’s true... → Then the question isn’t “Which phone is better?” anymore. → It’s “Which intelligence will run your life?” Because by 2030, your phone won’t have an OS — → It’ll have a personality 🤍 I’m genuinely curious — → Do you think we’re ready to live in a world where AI replaces the very idea of an operating system? #PostOSEra #AIRevolution #OpenAI #AppleIntelligence #GeminiAI #FutureTech #DigitalShift #Innovation #CtrlAltDiva #AI #AIEngineer #DeepLearning #MachineLearning #CNN #Google"
