      "snippet": "\"My high school geometry teacher advised a STEM club and I really enjoyed the creativity of the challenges I took part in through that. She always used to ask on the first day of class, “How do you touch the ceiling?”  and I like to think that engineering follows that similar concept; the end goal is clear, but there are a lot of different ways to get to that goal. As for Civil Engineering specifically, I ended up stumbling my way into the field as a happy accident. In high school, I was interviewed for my involvement in the STEM club and when asked about what type of engineering I wanted to pursue, I panicked and said “Civil”, with no actual idea as to what a civil engineer does. Fast forward a year later, I had to do a research paper on a career so it gave me a chance to learn about the [...] Rabeea W. Bazuhair, Ben C. Cox, Jesse D. Doyle, Jonathan Easterling, Jessica V. Lewis, Alex Middleton, Carl Pittman, Braden T. Smith, Abhinash Subedi, W. Griffin Sullivan.\"\n\nQ5. Why is professional licensure important to you?\n\n\"Professional licensure helps protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.  Professional licensure is also a lifelong process through which licensed professionals continue to stay current in their field.  Licensure is one of several ways that engineers and surveyors can better themselves and in turn improve people’s lives.\"\n\n---\n\n#### June 2025 Engineer Spotlight: Kayla Erickson, PE [...] \"Go for it!  Careers in STEM are so important and always will be.  I mentored middle school girls on the importance of STEM and used to tell them, it’s what makes the world go around!  We create communities, various aspects of those communities, and make sure those communities’ function like a well-oiled machine.  I’ve never regretted my career as an engineer and love what I do.  I sometimes get asked, “If you could be anything, what would it be?”.  My answer is always “an engineer”!  There is never a dull moment because all projects are unique in their own way.\"\n\nQ5.  Tell us about a recent project you worked on that exemplifies why you love being an engineer and / surveyor?"
