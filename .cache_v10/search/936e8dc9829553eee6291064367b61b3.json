      "snippet": "These tests include key metrics like rendering time, row creation speed, and memory usage across operations like updating and clearing large tables. When we compare the results, React utilizes a virtual DOM to manage UI updates efficiently. It demonstrates solid performance in the benchmarks, particularly in scenarios involving dynamic content rendering and updates. Vue.js also employs a virtual DOM and offers a reactive data-binding system. It consistently shows competitive performance, often matching or surpassing React in various test scenarios. Vue framework performs well in raw performance tests, especially when rendering large datasets.\n\n### Performance & Speed: Which One is Faster in 2025? [...] On the other hand, React continues to leverage React Fiber and Concurrent Rendering, which enhance responsiveness for highly dynamic applications. Benchmark tests comparing Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and hybrid approaches show that Vue excels in lightweight applications with minimal overhead, while React—especially when paired with Next.js—outperforms in large-scale, interactive platforms requiring SSR and streaming data updates.\n\nIn terms of memory usage, initial load time, and runtime performance, Vue retains an advantage in delivering smaller bundle sizes and faster hydration times, making it a solid choice for speed-critical applications. R [...] ### Performance & Speed: Which One is Faster in 2025?\n\nRegarding raw performance in 2025, both Vue and React have made significant optimizations, but their strengths cater to different use cases. Vue 3’s fine-grained reactivity system has been further refined, reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving efficiency in component updates."

      "snippet": "🚀 Vue.js vs React.js — Who Wins in Performance? A lot of developers (including me 😅) often wonder — “Which one performs better, Vue or React?” Here’s what I found after breaking it down 👇 ⚙️ 1. Rendering: Vue uses a fine-grained reactivity system — it only updates what’s necessary. React, on the other hand, may re-render more unless you optimize manually using memo or useCallback. ➡️ Winner: Vue (slightly faster in small/medium apps) ⚡ 2. Memory Usage: Vue’s reactivity system is lightweight and memory-efficient. ➡️ Winner: Vue 🧩 3. Bundle Size: Vue 3 ≈ 20 KB (gzip) React + ReactDOM ≈ 40 KB (gzip) ➡️ Winner: Vue 💥 4. Large-scale Apps: When projects grow huge, React’s ecosystem and optimization tools (like React Query, Suspense, concurrent rendering) shine. ➡️ Winner: React Sheryians Coding [...] 🚀 Performance Showdown: React vs Vue — Who’s Faster in Real-World Projects? Every developer has faced this question at least once — 👉 “React fast che ke Vue?” 😅 Here’s the truth (and not the one you’ll find in docs): 🔹 React is like that friend who brings a gym bag full of tools — powerful, flexible, but sometimes a bit… too much setup. Once optimized (memoization, lazy loading, suspense), it flies! 🏎️ 🔹 Vue, on the other hand, is like a lightweight racing bike — quick to start, smooth in performance, and easier to handle. Its built-in reactivity system often gives it the edge in smaller to mid-size projects. ⚡ But here’s the catch: In real-world projects, your code structure, component design, and API calls affect performance way more than the framework itself. 😎 So, React or Vue? Both [...] Most developers overlook how Vue's reactivity model simplifies complex state handling compared to manual state management in other frameworks. Vue’s reactivity tracks dependencies automatically, so you focus on your logic—not updating state or syncing UI manually. I’ve been bitten before juggling React’s useState and useEffect chains where bugs creep in as complexity grows. With Vue, when one piece of state changes, only the dependent parts update. This reduces wasted renders and keeps performance smooth in big apps. Here’s a quick example: building a dashboard with nested filters and real-time updates. In React, I had to write extra code to keep everything in sync. Vue’s reactive properties did all that out of the box. Once you really understand how Vue wraps your data with getters and"

      "snippet": "#### Speed\n\nOne of Vue's strongest points is its speed and performance, largely due to its efficient default library. Vue.js testing library allows the application to run more efficiently and quickly. Because there are so many features in Vue's official default library, 80 KB is enough to build most applications.\n\nReact.js, on the other hand, often requires downloading additional libraries. This means the size will continue to increase as new features are installed.\n\n### 2. Scaling: data flow\n\nVerdict: React.js is the first choice for developing large and complex apps, while Vue.js is preferred when developing simple and fast web applications. [...] Several factors influence how well an app is performing, including how efficiently the virtual DOM renders and how intuitive the development process is. Both Vue.js and React.js use a browser-independent virtual DOM, making their infrastructures similar and ensuring good performance and speed (although Vue.js's smaller file footprint often allows files to run quicker and more efficiently).\n\nThere are, however, key differences in how the technologies handle component creation and optimization.\n\n#### Vue.js\n\nVue.js, on the other hand, identifies updates much faster. It automatically tracks components and self-identifies updated reusable components. This is why when working with Vue.js, you won't need different optimization methods to get high performance."
