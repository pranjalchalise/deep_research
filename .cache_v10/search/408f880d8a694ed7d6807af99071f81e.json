      "snippet": "So here we go.\n\nWe try and keep it a little bit shorter than the normal JOCO podcast, not talk for five hours so that we people can digest them, get the lessons in and move on and try and keep up maybe like a half an hour or something like that.\n\nCover a couple of topics. So with that.\n\nDave, let's debrief, what do you got? Yeah, the cool part about talking about leadership all day, every day is like I can't think of anything else I'd rather be doing. And the conversations we're having are these real time problems that these companies are struggling with. And when we come up with a solution, it makes a huge impact. And I think the connection I was making when we're talking to it is how useful that you don't have to be at this company for the lesson and the takeaway to be useful for you. [...] I've also written a bunch of books on the subject of leadership, extreme ownership dichotomy, leadership, leadership, strategy and tactics. Got some other podcast, JOCO podcast, JOCO Unraveling, Grounded and The Warrior Kid podcast. And if you want to support any of these podcasts, including this one, then you can get some gear from JoCo store, dot com or origin main dotcom. Thanks for listening to the debrief now go out and lead. This is Dave and JoCo out.\n\nJocko and Good Deal Dave Analyze some issues and look for solutions.\n\nHappyScribe Podcasts Logo [...] HappyScribe Podcasts Logo\nThumbnail\n\n# Transcript of Jocko Debrief #1 with Dave Berke : Telling Your Employees The Truth\n\nThis is the JoCo De-brief podcast, episode one with Dave Burke and me, JoCo Willink.\n\nSo, Dave, here we are. I want to talk a little bit about how we got here and why we decided to do this.\n\nWhat we do at Echelon Front is work with companies. We talk to them about leadership. We try and pass on the lessons that we learned about leadership. We try and help them along the pathway and help the organization align all of their leadership.\n\nWe do the same thing with Eve online, which is our online platform, and we spend basically all day, every day talking about leadership with all these different individuals and all these different scenarios."
