Career planning was a continuous variable which indicated the extent to which employees reported taking the initiative in making personal career plans. Gould’s (1979) scale was commonly used. Two examples of items were as follows: “I have a strat-egy for achieving my career goals” and “I have a plan for my career.” Political knowledge and skills included the following two measures: po-litical knowledge (e.g., Chao, O’Leary-Kelly, Wolf, Klein, & Gardner, 1994; Seibert, Kraimer, & Crant, 2001) and supervisor-focused political tactics (e.g., Wayne, Liden, Graf, & Ferris, 1997).

But change in and of itself creates stressand is best accomplished, if the change is to be fast, by mandate or by the infusion of funds. The preferable alternative is, after the individual school has studied the needs of its own students and has identified some goals, to move toward achieving them gradually to achieve specific improvements. Educational reform which provides more school programs designed to prevent failure before it occurs is crucial. The emphasis must bc on enlarging the learning opportunities for the non-college bound, the at-risk students, the half or more of high school students who go directly from high school to work and especially the blacks, the Hispanics [...] Self.Esteem Success creates the likelihood of more success and greater willingness to move into the unknown with confidence. This self-confidence, feelings of self-worth or lack of it, significantly impact the relationship each t j 28 CAREER DEvELoPmENT; PREPARING FOR ME 21ST CENTURY student has with learning, peers, and family. Since the school essentially controls the opportunity to achieve in-school success, pacing student learning goals to what the student is ready to grasp is critical. The intent is to promote a sense of self-efficacy, the feeling of being in the driver's seat and of being able to change one's own behavior to reach identified goals. [...] Those involved in the leadership of the planning process must be able to project plans of various typesshort- and long-range, safe and daring, and/or planned or unanticipated. The process encompasses the iden-tification and development of course offerings, and the establishment of policies and procedures that will meet the current needs of students and employees for career development. At the same time, administrators are required to assess trends with sufficient clarity to anticipate and meet long-range goals and needs. This will require the individual adminis-trator to be knowledgeable of the economic, social, and political processes of the community, flexibility and open-mindedness will be characteristics required so that the focus will not only be on short-term or immediate"

      "snippet": "goals (Raabe et al., 2007). As described by Frese and Zapf (1994), action regulation involves an action sequence that starts by setting goals, then proceeds forward by collecting information, planning for a specific course of action, executing relevant activities, and reflecting on the process. Raabe et al. (2007) applied action regulation theory to career self-management by introducing and analyzing a career management intervention. The intervention included training 205 white-collar employees to be active agents in their career building. In action regulation theory, individuals steer their career activities in line with their career goals. Such regulation takes place via setting goals, plans, and feedback. Raabe et al. (2007) found that career self-management, practiced through goal [...] development. Hence, knowledgeability is more of a state of understanding of the world of work rather than a specific set of technical information on the labor market. Understanding the value of higher education for social mobility in a specific region or the importance of foreign language proficiency as a strategy for fitting within certain organizational cultures are examples of what knowledgeability would entail. In that sense, knowledgeability is not a mere marginal input to an action-regulation process. Instead, it guides and informs the whole process from initiation to goal realization. It shapes what career goals to pursue, how to define career success, how to choose among multiple career alternatives, and what kind of active measures to adopt. CEU eTD Collection 46 Additionally, [...] intended goals. Finally, self-reflectiveness is a form of self-consciousness and a metacognitive ability to reflect upon one's thoughts and actions. Central to self-reflectiveness, perceived self-efficacy beliefs are considered the foundation of human agency. Perceived self-efficacy stems from the belief of individuals that they can perform relevant tasks and produce the expected outcomes. Therefore, these beliefs can be self-enhancing or self-hindering. For the purpose of this study and to simplify the conceptualization of the career self-management process, I combine intentionality and forethought under the same step/stage of the process (i.e., forethought). Since both mechanisms work in harmony, it is conceivable to conceptualize them as going hand in hand in graduates’ endeavors to"
