      "snippet": "2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020)\n\n“A surreal utopia where friends turned into F.R.I.E.N.D.S, and fanatics into professionals. Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad(2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] 2020\n\n## Shruti Pokhrel\n\nTeam Kisan(2020)\n\n“Incubate Nepal was truly an overwhelming experience that paved the way for me to make connections with people whilst developing teamwork and analytical skills. Exposure to open-ended projects under the guidance of some of the highly accomplished mentors to channel our creative stream and collaborate in prototyping an application ‘KISAN' - perhaps the best aspect of the project. It was through this opportunity that I was able to peek into the world beyond and believe in the possibility of the tremendous potential there is for me to learn and work in the near future.”\n\n2020\n\n## Shrijan Pandey\n\nTeam Arthasastra(2020)"
