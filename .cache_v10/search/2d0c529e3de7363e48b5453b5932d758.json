[...] The Centre Learning Commons\n\nThe mission of the Centre Learning Commons (CLC) is to maximize the academic success and personal growth of all Centre students. This is achieved through collaborative relationships among many organizational areas of the college such as Academic Affairs, The Library, the Center for Teaching and Learning, and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Additional collaborators include the Center for Career and Professional Development, Counseling Services, Title IX, Athletics, Student Life, Student Government, and individual academic programs. [...] CLC staff implement best practice strategies for providing academic support services to all students, including student populations with specific needs (e.g. learning disabilities, ESL, ASL, and underprepared and/or academically at-risk students). CLC staff also serve as a resource for those seeking advice (students, advisors, faculty) on strategies to improve academic performance, and will assist students in developing individualized study plans, strengthening executive functioning skills, and facilitating self-advocacy. Students are encouraged to contact a member of the CLC staff via email (clc@centre.edu) to schedule a personal consultation.\n\nThe Center for Career & Professional Development"
