      "snippet": "Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced \"view\"( is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.( It was created by Evan You and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.(\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nVue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.( Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.( [...] ### Reactivity\n\n[edit]\n\nVue features a reactivity system that uses plain JavaScript objects and optimized re-rendering. Each component keeps track of its reactive dependencies during its render, so the system knows precisely when to re-render, and which components to re-render.(\n\n### Transitions\n\n[edit]\n\nVue provides a variety of ways to apply transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM. This includes tools to:\n\n   Automatically apply classes for CSS transitions and animations\n   Integrate third-party CSS animation libraries, such as Animate.css\n   Use JavaScript to directly manipulate the DOM during transition hooks\n   Integrate third-party JavaScript animation libraries, such as Velocity.js \"Velocity (JavaScript library)\") [...] Features\n\n[edit]\n\n### Components\n\n[edit]\n\nVue components extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. At a high level, components are custom elements to which the Vue's compiler attaches behavior. In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue instance with pre-defined options.( The code snippet below contains an example of a Vue component. The component presents a button and prints the number of times the button is clicked:\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <script src=\"\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <button-clicked :initial-count=\"0\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n const {\n defineComponent,\n ref,\n computed,\n watch,\n watchEffect,\n onMounted,\n createApp\n } = Vue"

But the web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways:\n\n Enhancing static HTML without a build step\n Embedding as Web Components on any page\n Single-Page Application (SPA)\n Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)\n Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal [...] Declarative Rendering: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.\n Reactivity: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.\n\nYou may already have questions - don't worry. We will cover every little detail in the rest of the documentation. For now, please read along so you can have a high-level understanding of what Vue offers."

      "snippet": "## Key Features of Vue Js\n\n### 1. Lightweight\n\nVue.js framework has a small 18 KB file size, ensuring fast installation and loading. Its lightweight nature enhances user experience and positively impacts SEO.\n\n### 2. Reactive Data Binding\n\nVue.js offers a robust reactivity system that keeps your data and UI in sync. With reactive data binding, when the data changes, the view automatically updates. This feature simplifies the process of managing dynamic user interfaces, making it easier to build interactive and responsive applications.\n\nFor instance:\n\nImagine you're developing a real-time chat application. Vue.js’s reactive data binding ensures that as new messages come, the chat window updates immediately without requiring a manual refresh.\n\n### 3. Component-Based Architecture [...] ### 3. Component-Based Architecture\n\nVue.js follows component-based architecture, allowing it to encapsulate the structure, styling, and behaviour of a UI into a self-contained component. This approach promotes code reuse, better organization, and easier testing.\n\nFor instance:\n\nWhen building a dashboard with multiple widgets (charts, tables, forms), each widget can be developed as a separate Vue component.\n\n### 4. Two-Way Data Binding\n\nVue.js supports two-way data binding, which allows for seamless synchronization between the model and the view. This feature is particularly useful in form handling and real-time data applications. Reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed to manage input fields.\n\nFor instance: [...] ### 12. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n\nVue.js supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), which allows you to pre-render components on the server and send fully rendered HTML to the client. SSR improves SEO and reduces the time to the first meaningful paint, especially in content-heavy applications.\n\nFor instance:\n\nUsing SSR for an e-commerce site ensures quick-loading product pages and better search engine visibility, improving user experience.\n\n### 13. Internationalization (i18n)\n\nVue.js supports internationalization (i18n) through plugins like vue-i18n, allowing you to create multilingual applications easily. This feature is crucial for applications targeting a global audience.\n\nFor instance:"
