      "snippet": "the importance of purposive sampling that \"good qualitative researchers, at the very least, engage in purposeful sampling, which means that they purposefully choose data that fit the parameters of the project’s research questions, goals, and purposes\" (p.82). In the same vein, I had adopted purposive sampling in my PhD study because purposive sampling allows me to select the rich-information participants that generally cannot be obtained from other participants. In addition, I had developed the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the participant selection for my PhD research. [...] The dominance of the positivist approach nowadays is gradually decreasing since many of the graduate students have been motivated as they have been carrying out their research by employing qualitative research. However, in doing the academic study, both the master's degree students as well as PhD scholars, have been facing the problem of determining the proper sample size for their qualitative studies. Generally, samples in qualitative research are called the 'participants' or 'informants' rather than respondents (Nakkeeran, 2016; Padgett, 2013). Hence, the debate of sample size turns into determining 'the number of participants' (Barkhuizen, 2014) for the qualitative research. I have also faced a similar problem and remained in a dilemma to determine the participants for my doctoral [...] The study has concluded that the purpose of the research, methodological choices, theoretical framework and analytical strategy, data saturation, researcher's knowledge and experience, and institutional and supervisor's requirements need to be considered while choosing the participants in qualitative research. In addition, the focus has been to explore in-depth information from small number of participants. Generally, participants in qualitative research can be added or removed during the research process rather than the prior determination. This paper suggests that the researchers are autonomous to select the participants in qualitative research and they can choose from a single to twenty samples that can be varied upon the depth of the information required and the nature of the inquiry."

      "snippet": "proteins, single-cell proteins, algal supplements, and food waste utilization. It also addresses barriers to adoption, such as technical challenges, financial constraints, knowledge gaps, and policy frameworks, which are crucial for advancing the poultry industry. This paper examined organic poultry farming in detail, noting several benefits like reduced pesticide use and improved animal welfare. Additionally, it discusses optimizing feed efficiency, an alternate energy source (solar photovoltaic/thermal), effective waste management, and the importance of poultry welfare. Transformative strategies, such as holistic farming systems and integrated approaches, are proposed to improve resource use and nutrient cycling and promote climate-smart agricultural practices. The review underscores [...] As global demand for poultry products, environmental sustainability, and health consciousness rises with time, the poultry industry faces both substantial challenges and new opportunities. Therefore, this review paper provides a comprehensive overview of sustainable poultry farming, focusing on integrating genetic improvements, alternative feed, precision technologies, waste management, and biotechnological innovations. Together, these strategies aim to minimize ecological footprints, uphold ethical standards, improve economic feasibility, and enhance industry resilience. In addition, this review paper explores various sustainable strategies, including eco-conscious organic farming practices and innovative feed sources like insect-based proteins, single-cell proteins, algal supplements, [...] agricultural practices. The review underscores the need for a structured roadmap, education, and extension services through digital platforms and participatory learning to promote sustainable poultry farming for future generations. It emphasizes the need for collaboration and knowledge exchange among stakeholders and the crucial role of researchers, policymakers, and industry professionals in shaping a future where sustainable poultry practices lead the industry, committed to ethical and resilient poultry production."

      "snippet": "The art of producing recombinant proteins with complex post-translational modifications represents a major challenge for studies of structure and function. The rapid establishment and high recovery from transiently-transfected mammalian cell lines addresses this barrier and is an effective means of expressing proteins that are naturally channeled through the ER and Golgi-mediated secretory pathway. Here is one protocol for protein expression using the human HEK293F and HEK293S cell lines transfected with a mammalian expression vector designed for high protein yields. The applicability of this system is demonstrated using three representative glycoproteins that expressed with yields between 95-120 mg of purified protein recovered per liter of culture. These proteins are the human FcγRIIIa [...] ### Actions\n\n### Page navigation\n\n# High Yield Expression of Recombinant Human Proteins with the Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells in Suspension\n\n### Affiliations\n\n# High Yield Expression of Recombinant Human Proteins with the Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells in Suspension\n\n### Authors\n\n### Affiliations\n\n## Erratum in\n\n## Abstract [...] PubMed Disclaimer\n\n## Figures\n\nNone\n\n## References\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## Substances\n\n## Grants and funding\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n### Full Text Sources\n\n### Other Literature Sources\n\nMyJove Corporation full text link\n\nNCBI Literature Resources\n\nMeSH\nPMC\nBookshelf\nDisclaimer\n\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
