      "snippet": "# Student Activities and Organizations\n\nCentre emphasizes student independence, initiative, responsibility, and leadership in the development and enhancement of student co-curricular activities and student organizations. However, the Student Life Office seeks to provide support, encouragement, and advice as needed and desired by the students. The Director of Campus Activities and Greek Life works with groups and their advisors to develop leadership and organizational strength and to help co-curricular life contribute to the enhanced development of students and the educational mission of the institution. Contact the Director of Campus Activities and Greek Life for a current listing of all student organizations. This list is also available on Centre’s website. [...] Students are encouraged to organize and join groups that promote their common interests. A group shall become an official organization when registered by the institution through the Student Life Office and Student Government Association. The College believes in the co-curricular experience and its potential contribution to building community. Centre delegates authority and responsibility for student organization activity along the following line: Board of Trustees, President, Vice President of Student Life, and Dean of Students or designee, and heads of student organizations. [...] Registered student organizations must have purposes and objectives which are compatible with the mission of Centre College, though institutional registration does not indicate endorsement by the College of the aims, objectives, or policies of that organization. A student group must be an officially registered student organization in order to use the Centre College name, to be listed in official publications, to advertise on campus, and to be recognized by the Student Government Association and be eligible to receive funds allocated from the student activities fee.\n\nRegistration Process"
