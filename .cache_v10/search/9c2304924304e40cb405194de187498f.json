The method is similar in many respects to some realizations of techniques such as implicit ﬁtness sharing, stepwise adaptation of weights and ﬁtness case selection, but the details differ and HAH is generally simpler and more efﬁcient. It also leads to different generalizations. We present results from large-scale, systematic tests of HAH and we also discuss the technique in [...] In Spector, Lee, Goodman, Erik D., Wu, Annie, Langdon, W.
