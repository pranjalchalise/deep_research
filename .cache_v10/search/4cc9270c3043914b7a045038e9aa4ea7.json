      "snippet": "Special mechanisms are added to support cul-tural transmission of information, and the resulting impacts on evolvability are observed. The data show that the presence of culture-supporting mechanisms can have a clear beneﬁcial impact on the evolvability of correct programs.\nFrom an engineering perspective, the results show that the efﬁciency of genetic programming can be improved through the addition of culture-supporting mechanisms; since the mechanisms are also simple and easy to add, practitioners of evolutionary computation should consider their use for other problems. From a cognitive science perspective, the results may shed some light on the relations between evolution and culture more broadly, and they may also suggest new uses of evolutionary computation in cognitive modeling. [...] On the other hand, culture appears to be extremely useful in certain situations (e.g., for humans). This suggests that we might expect correspondingly large impacts in certain genetic programming domains. [...] ing the next generation of programs by means of a variety of genetic operationsincluding reproduction,crossover, and mu-tation. After a preestablished number of generations, or after the ﬁtness improves to some preestablished level, the best-of-run individual is designated as the result and is produced as the output from the genetic programming system. Details of program representation and algorithms for all genetic op-erators, along with full source code for genetic programming systems, can be found in (Koza, 1992) and (Koza, 1994)."

      "snippet": "selection method called lexical selection which takes every challenge that you might have as a sort of independent tests and programs subjected to these in random sequences and this produces much more diverse populations each of member of which might specialize in different abilities and yet selects parents that are good at certain things and good at certain combinations of things and this has produced much better results in certain areas of genetic programming and so I'm very excited about where that's going to lead certainly that's it it is now being applied in several commercial settings in particular genetic programming is quite good at finding formulae that characterize data doing prediction doing classification I'm more excited about future commercial applications where the system [...] prior genetic programming work we evaluate each program and give it some sort of numerical grade for how good it is and then we use those grades to select well who deserves to have babies that along with many other aspects of our evolutionary processes is a real caricature of what happens in in biological situations and this is one area where we felt it was too much of a caricature that it's holding us back in in real life you are not judged by one number that determines how many offspring you're going to have rather you face a sequence of challenges over your life and the ways in which you handle them either do or do don't get you to the point where you have offspring it's true of all life forms so we developed a new parent selection method called lexical selection which takes every [...] to design a system that would do that thing or that it was even possible but evolution found the way to do it and that convinced me early on that genetic programming could find quantum algorithms that were beyond my ability to find and and indeed it turned out that it can find algorithms that were beyond the ability of any humans to find and so we ended up having new results emerged from our genetic programming system which were publishable as results in the physics literature which evolution found we did not find the evolutionary process map so that was very exciting well one of the key questions in the design of a genetic programming system is what is the language in which the evolving programs will be expressed and it turns out that matters a lot ideally you want a language that can"
