It posits that genetic pro-gramming practice (including both applications and technique enhance-ments) is moving toward biology and that it should continue to do so. [...] 1.\nTheory and Practice Researchers in the ﬁeld of genetic and evolutionary computation bor-row features of biological systems to produce adaptive problem-solving technologies. For the earliest such technologies, only the most general, skeletal features of biological genetics (as then understood) were ap-propriated.\nFor example, many early systems represented candidate solutions as linearly structured, positionally encoded genomes, borrow-i Preprint version of \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding of Genetic Programming,\" by Lee Spector, to appear in Genetic Programming Theory and Practice, edited by Rick Riolo and Bill Worzel, Kluwer (now Springer), 2003, pages 11-24. [...] Genetic programming, by which I mean the specialization of “genetic and evolutionary computation” to systems that evolve executable com-puter programs, arose later, in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. In the succeeding years, genetic programming theory and practice (in which I include both applications-oriented work and development of new tech-niques) have both undergone steady progress, although not always in a coordinated ways.\nWith the basic theory already established, system builders and appli-cations engineers felt free to experiment with variations (“hack”), with-out paying much attention to mathematical theory. For the theorists, on the other hand, there was much work to be done in clarifying and developing the mathematics, irrespective of the activities of the hackers."
