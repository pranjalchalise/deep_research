Excess Commitment in R&D (with T. Liu), December 2025 The Review of Financial Studies , accepted [ PDF ] — Presented at (selected conferences only): Kentucky Finance Conference 2023, LBS Summer Finance Symposium 2023, EFA 2023 , NFA 2023, HEC Paris Entrepreneurship Workshop, AFA 2024*, Texas Finance Festival 2024*, NBER Corporate Finance Spring Meeting 2024, SFS Cavalcade 2024* We document that firms exhibit “excess” commitment to R&D projects and examine its consequences for innovation outcomes. Using detailed data on pharmaceutical firms’ clinical trial projects, we find that trial delays, empirically uncorrelated with multiple project-quality measures, substantially reduce firms’ subsequent project-termination propensity. This result remains robust when we use variation in clinical trial site congestion to instrument for unexpected delays. Excess commitment intensifies when CEO compensation has greater stock-price sensitivity and the CEO is responsible for the project’s initiation. Our findings have broader implications: delay-driven commitment reduces new drug project initiations, with further evidence suggesting efficiency losses for firms. 3. CEO Stress, Aging, and Death (with M. Borgschulte, C. Liu, and U. Malmendier) The Journal of Finance , December 2025, Vol 80 (6), pp. 3401-3442.

Using a difference-in-differences design, we apply neural network–based machine-learning techniques to CEOs’ facial images and show that exposure to industry distress shocks during the Great Recession produces visible signs of aging. We estimate a one-year increase in “apparent” age. Moreover, using data on CEOs since the mid-1970s, we estimate a 1.1-year decrease in life expectancy after an industry distress shock, but a two-year increase when antitakeover laws insulate CEOs from market discipline. The estimated health costs are significant, both in absolute terms and relative to other health risks. 2. In Too Deep: The Effect of Sunk Costs on Corporate Investment The Journal of Finance , June 2025, Vol 80 (3), pp. 1593-1646. [ PDF ] — Presented at (selected): AFA 2021, Behavioral Economics Annual Meeting (BEAM) 2021, Finance, Markets, and Organizations (FOM) Conference 2021, Berkeley-Stanford Joint Finance Conference Fall 2019, Michigan Ross, U Maryland, UCL, Wharton — Featured on: Knowledge@Wharton Sunk costs are unrecoverable costs that should not affect decision-making. I provide evidence that firms systematically fail to ignore sunk costs and that this leads to significant investment distortions. In fixed-exchange-ratio stock mergers, aggregate market fluctuations after parties enter into a binding merger agreement induce plausibly exogenous variation in the final acquisition cost. These quasi-random cost shocks strongly predict firms’ commitment to an acquired business following deal completion, with an interquartile cost increase reducing subsequent divestiture rates by 8% to 9%. Consistent with an intrapersonal sunk cost channel, distortions are concentrated in firm-years in which the acquiring CEO is still in office. 1. Behavioral Corporate Finance: The Life Cycle of a CEO Career (with U. Malmendier) Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and Finance , Oxford University Press, September 2020. [ PDF ] [ NBER WP ] [ CEPR DP ] — Featured on: Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance , Wharton on SiriusXM , Knowledge@Wharton , Penn Today One of the fastest-growing areas of finance research is the study of managerial biases and their implications for firm outcomes. Since the mid-2000s, this strand of behavioral corporate finance has provided theoretical and empirical evidence on the influence of biases in the corporate realm, such as overconfidence, experience effects, and the sunk-cost fallacy. The field has been a leading force in dismantling the argument that traditional economic mechanisms — selection, learning, and market discipline — would suffice to uphold the rational-manager paradigm. Instead, the evidence reveals that behavioral forces exert a significant influence at every stage of a chief executive officer’s (CEO’s) career. First, at the appointment stage, selection does not impede the promotion of behavioral managers. Instead, competitive environments oftentimes promote their advancement, even under value-maximizing selection mechanisms. Second, while at the helm of the company, learning opportunities are limited, since many managerial decisions occur at low frequency, and their causal effects are clouded by self-attribution bias and difficult to disentangle from those of concurrent events. Third, at the dismissal stage, market discipline does not ensure the firing of biased decision-makers as board members themselves are subject to biases in their evaluation of CEOs. By documenting how biases affect even the most educated and influential decision-makers, such as CEOs, the field has generated important insights into the hard-wiring of biases. Biases do not simply stem from a lack of education, nor are they restricted to low-ability agents. Instead, biases are significant elements of human decision-making at the highest levels of organizations. An important question for future research is how to limit, in each CEO career phase, the adverse effects of managerial biases. Potential approaches include refining selection mechanisms, designing and implementing corporate repairs, and reshaping corporate governance to account not only for incentive misalignments but also for biased decision-making. * denotes presentation by coauthor, ** denotes scheduled presentation"
