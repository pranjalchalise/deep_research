Table of Contents Machine Learning vs Artificial Intelligence vs Deep Learning Evolution of Machine Learning The Future is Now: Latest Advancements of Machine Learning The Future of Machine Learning: Key Problems The Future of Machine Learning: Trends When Man Meets Machine: Will ML Replace Humans in the Future? The Future of Machine Learning: Next Steps FAQs Machine Learning vs Artificial Intelligence vs Deep Learning Many people wrongly use the terms machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial intelligence (AI) interchangeably. To better understand the future of machine learning, one must be able to differentiate between these 3 concepts. Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term, encompassing both machine learning and deep learning. It is inspired by the human brain and focuses on mimicking people’s behavior. Machine learning is about creating an algorithm that a computer uses to provide valuable insights, with data being its key component. It is unique in developing algorithms that learn from data to solve problems without programming. Like a human, a model learns through experience and improves its accuracy over time. At the core, you’ll find deep learning —an advanced feature of ML whose algorithm has its own learning mechanisms. As the heart of AI, the future of deep learning is closely related to the machine learning industry. The harmonious work of these three domains determines the data science future and the direction of the entire technological world. Evolution of Machine Learning Although we can’t name a single person or event that made it all happen, the evolution of machine learning tells us just how multi-dimensional the field can be. Some believe it all started back in 1943 when Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch presented the world’s first mathematical model of neural networks . Here’s a simplified representation of the concept, consisting of 2 parts— g and f . In a couple of years, the famous book The Organization of Behavior by Donald Hebb was released to later become a turning point in the future of machine learning. It wasn’t until the 1990s that the very first machine learning technology was introduced to the world. That’s how the spam filter came into existence, and people could now save time sorting out emails. This significant milestone represented the collective effort of scientists and marked the beginning of the contemporary ML era.

The Future of Machine Learning: Key Problems Machine learning—as revolutionary as it may be—isn’t flawless. Its enormous potential comes with a number of challenges that are shaping up the digital world of tomorrow. A visionary, however, will always turn a stumbling block into a stepping stone. We believe today’s problems trigger tomorrow’s solutions, so let’s find out what the future applications of machine learning may be. Data Acquisition Machine learning technology can only produce relevant and high-quality results if we feed enough data into the model. The need for massive resources then raises a question as to how unbiased and accurate the training data can possibly be. In what way do we ensure flawless input and sound results? The \"g arbage-in, garbage-out\" principle is what drives the proper functioning of machine learning in big data , and that’s a real challenge in today’s information-flooded environment. Resources Generally, the use of machine learning technology requires a lot of resources, such as powerful computers, time for developing, perfecting, and revising a model, financing, and data collection . Businesses must be ready to take on considerable investments before reaping the harvest of adopting machine learning. Data Transformation Contrary to popular belief, machine learning technology isn’t made for identifying and modifying algorithms—it’s about transforming raw data into a set of features to capture the essence of that information. In its autonomy, ML can make some mistakes that affect its efficiency in the long run. Error susceptibility is certainly a major aspect to consider when transforming data with ML. Result Interpretation and Machine Learning Technology An ML model tends to make self-fulfilling predictions. When training data and identified patterns are wrong, the algorithms will still use this information as a basis for generating and processing new data. And it may take some time before you realize that the model has been working in favor of the underlying bias. For this reason, result interpretation may turn into a challenging task for the user. Bias and Discrimination How businesses prevent bias and discrimination when training data can be corrupted. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions—a proverb that describes the ethical dilemmas of the ever-growing digital universe very well. Although you mean well when building a model to automate processes, you may unintentionally ignore or misinterpret an important human factor, which you would have otherwise prioritized. That’s a major issue when incorporating ML within recruitment and hiring practices. The Future of Machine Learning: Trends Dave Waters once said: A baby learns to crawl, walk, and then run.
