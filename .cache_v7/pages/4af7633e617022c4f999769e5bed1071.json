This thesis will be on my desk and it will be an important working tool.\" Pr. Alexandre Stylios Faculty of law, Laval University, Canada In brief: some findings from the doctoral thesis in simple language Regarding actors who gather digital evidence on individuals that can be used against them in criminal proceedings: On police There is currently a vast national and international evidence-gathering ecosystem , made up of the police, intelligence services, and private corporations. This evidence-gathering ecosystem is complemented by partners from each of these three entities. On intelligence services Intelligence services are increasingly present in national police investigations, and this presence is encouraged by a legal framework that authorises the conclusion of agreements and protocols for collaboration and intelligence sharing with police services. A major problem with this police-intelligence rapprochement is the fact that abusive intelligence gathering practices by intelligence services are difficult to detect (if not undetectable), difficult to challenge (how can you challenge something you don't know?), and these concealed abuses have the potential to taint the legality of police investigations (the police being known, as well, for a history of abuses in evidence gathering). There is a history of abuse of power by intelligence services regarding their surveillance activities, especially domestic surveillance, gathering intelligence and sharing intelligence, as well as a propensity for recalcitrant behavior when it comes time to truly be held accountable. These intelligence services have long been accustomed to operating in the shadows and are constantly under pressure to be more transparent. On private corporations The current legal framework essentially authorises private corporations to also act as investigators in relation with their clients — you: private corporations collect an exorbitant amount of personal information (personal communications, online searches, purchases, political opinions, ideological views, sexual preferences, etc.) which these corporations can then provide to the police, upon request (mandate) or voluntarily, on their own initiative (by snitching). While the State is prohibited from conducting widespread surveillance of an individual, the civil law framework authorises and facilitates such 24-hour data gathering by private corporations, which create files on their clients or customers. This legal dynamic, where the State obtains what private corporations constantly collect, allows the State to do indirectly what fundamental protections in criminal law prohibit it from doing directly : conduct widespread surveillance of an individual. Private corporations have the ability to undetectably abuse the data they have collected on individuals , subjectively and selectively deciding, even in a discriminatory manner, on who, when, and how to selectively snitch to State investigative services, according to their own criteria, values, desires, definitions of what they consider acceptable or unacceptable, or other arbitrary corporate decision-making factors to that effect. The consent to collection obtained by private corporations from the individual on whom they collect this data, consent which must be free and informed, is in many cases “ not so free ” (for example in situations of constraint or necessity to use technology without an equivalent alternative means: the employer who requires you to use the Zoom application for your professional activities, etc.) and “ not so informed ” ( the individual does not really know what is being collected on him or what private corporations actually do with this data once collected, regardless of what they claim as the supposed reason for gathering ). Regarding the tools used by evidence gatherers to collect digital evidence on the individual: Over the past 20 years, Canadian and French legislators have inflated the legislative framework on evidence gathering in criminal and penal law, integrating the new digital infrastructure into the arsenal of tools used by the State to conduct investigations. Evidence gatherers collect 5 categories of digital evidence : telecommunications (metadata and substance), geolocation (which makes it possible to determine not only your exact location at a specific moment in time, but also your proximity to a crime committed at that location, making it possible to infer participation in the commission of the crime), biometric identification (facial, voice, digital, DNA, etc.), behavioral evidence, and financial evidence. The smartphone is the ultimate tool for collecting all 5 categories of digital evidence, a tool that, coincidentally, is carried by everyone everywhere they go. The preferred method of data gathering by private corporations is the civil service agreement , concluded between an individual and a corporation. This civil service agreement has de facto become a tool for data gathering , data that the corporation transfers to the police upon request (mandate) or even voluntarily (through snitching). By collecting and storing information through civil service agreements, private corporations de facto create a permanent digital registry that allows for the generation of a user personality profile , which can later be accessed by police services in criminal investigations. Regarding fundamental protections in criminal and penal law, those that were supposed to be a counterbalance to the intrusive aspects of police investigations: Fundamental protections require enhancement and the adoption of a more holistic approach to criminal and penal law , and even a shift in perception regarding what criminal and penal law is, is absolutely necessary. A first step in the perceptual shift that should occur in people's minds is to consider that the use of a smartphone to chat on Teams or Zoom is potentially a matter falling under criminal and penal law. The right to anonymity : although the right to anonymity is the cornerstone of the right to privacy and a gateway to other fundamental rights, the right to anonymity does not find real application in practice since anonymity online, but also in everyday life, is increasingly fictitious. Chain of custody : it is increasingly difficult to prove the origin of digital evidence or the integrity of digital evidence, particularly considering that digital evidence is even more malleable than physical evidence and can be subject to alterations, sometimes undetectably. Exclusion of evidence : case law seems to prioritise the use of evidence obtained in an obscure or questionable manner, rather than its exclusion. In theory, the judge must carry out a “case-by-case” analysis, but in reality, the acceptance of such evidence is much more frequent than anticipated. The transition from investigation to pre-investigation : traditionally, to initiate a police investigation under Canadian law, the police must have reasonable grounds to suspect that the person has committed a crime. Today, the constant 24/7 collection of a huge amount of data on the individual bypasses this protection granted by the State to the individual, as this type of collection requires a simple \"I accept\" of the terms of use of an electronic device or a digital application, and that’s it, the game is on: the investigation on all of you begins. This investigation is now ongoing and is equivalent to a pre-investigation carried out in advance, waiting to be consulted by the police at the opportune moment. Digital identity and its integration into citizens’ lives: it is sold to the public as a convenience that facilitates citizens' lives and access to government services, but it will be used to gather and centralise an impressive amount of evidence that can be used in criminal and penal investigations. An effort to create and implement a federated digital identity is currently being carried out by the civil sphere, with the aim of consolidating a multitude of information ranging from traditional legal identity to the integration of behavioral, economic, biometric and other innovations coming from the new digital infrastructure . Once this digital identity has been created and officially implemented, the police will be able to access the individual's personal information, centralised under the label of \"digital identity\". As a result, the investigation or a significant part of the investigation that the authorities would have had to carry out in criminal and penal law is already there, ready to be used. Sentient World Simulation : This is a technology that has existed for over 20 years, used by private and public actors, including the State, to duplicate the real lives of individuals and to automatically track past events in the real world, in real time. It is a technology that simulates the real world, the simulation being fed with data and intelligence from all sources. This simulation creates a virtual copy of you and observes how your copy (your digital clone) interacts with the digital copy of other individuals, with real-world institutions or with events that have happened in real life. Such level of intrusiveness, which is difficult to comprehend and is not publicly debated, makes current protections essentially theoretical. A few comments from the experts who examined the doctoral thesis Arthur Oulaï is a professor at the Faculty of Law at the University of Sherbrooke since 2007. He is co-director of the Specialized Graduate Diploma in Business Law and Corporate Risk ( DARE ). Professor Oulaï is a researcher at the Centre for Research on Regulation and Governance Law ( CRDG ) and a researcher at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Cybersecurity at the University of Sherbrooke and the Group for Dispute Prevention and Resolution ( GPRD ). Professor Oulaï is also a member of the Centre for International and Defence Policy ( CIDP ) at Queen's University. \"Mr. Popa is assured of making a valuable contribution with his thesis. Its practical interest is undeniable, particularly due to an analysis of both Canadian and French case law in criminal and penal law.\" \"As for its theoretical interest, it is real, the candidate having engaged in a rare substantial analysis of widespread surveillance through data gathering thanks to the progress of digital tools.\" \"He also proposes some avenues that should lead to a strengthening of the protection of fundamental rights.\" Review report for the defence of the doctoral thesis Review report for the defence of the doctoral thesis : \"The thesis is structured around three chapters that allow for the assessment of the extent of digital evidence gathering, identifying and addressing the legal issues raised in criminal and penal matters. The first chapter examines the \"new digital infrastructure\" and the legislative provisions that encourage widespread surveillance. The second chapter highlights the interaction between the police, private corporations, and intelligence services in a vast intelligence-sharing space. The last chapter outlines a number of avenues for ensuring the protection of fundamental freedoms.\" Doctoral thesis defence report, December 18, 2024 : \"Professor Arthur Oulaï highlights the quality of the work done by Mr. Popa. He has endeavoured to highlighting the extent of the surveillance carried out during police investigations aimed to gathering evidence.\" Review report for the defence of the doctoral thesis : \"The thesis as a whole presents a critical portrait of mass surveillance. Despite the existence of judicial control over police conduct to 'maintain the rule of law and prevent State abuses and arbitrary infringements of individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms' (p. 70), it struggles to provide the expected protection.\" \"Mr. Popa deserves credit for providing a thorough examination of the new tools for gathering digital evidence in criminal and penal matters.\" Doctoral thesis defence report, December 18, 2024 : “In addition to noting the omnipresence of data gathering that ensues, Mr. Popa has gone beyond the usual narrow approaches to enrich his study with an analysis that integrates criminal law and civil law, thus highlighting the unsuspected role of private corporations in this approach of surveillance by police forces both in France and in Canada. Mr. Popa thus makes a real contribution to legal analysis in this field.” Doctoral thesis defence report, December 18, 2024 : \"Professor Oulaï was keen to point out that writing this thesis was certainly an intellectual exercise for Mr. Popa, but also a personal commitment to raising awareness of the importance of respecting fundamental rights in the context of police investigations boosted by the power of information technologies.\" Olivier Décima is a professor of private law and criminal sciences at the Faculty of Law and Political Science at the University of Bordeaux since 2012.

While the issue of the protection of fundamental rights in criminal proceedings, particularly the right to privacy, is often addressed in light of new investigative techniques, few studies of this magnitude had been previously conducted. Mr. Popa therefore chose his subject well.\" Review report for the defence of the doctoral thesis : \"Through its 'holistic' approach, to use Mr. Popa's terminology, the thesis undeniably advances knowledge.\" \"This work will be useful both to academics and to police officers, lawyers or magistrates.\" Review report for the defence of the doctoral thesis : \"Mr. POPA's thesis is very well done. The presentation is impeccable.\" \"The writing style is clear and precise, very pleasant to read.\" \"The writing skills are evident.\" Review report for the defence of the doctoral thesis : \"The research conducted by Mr. Popa is undeniably very serious.\" \"The comparison between the Quebec system and the French system is rich.
