Getting started Prerequisites Git Node: any version starting with v16.8.0 or greater Yarn: See Yarn website for installation instructions A fork of the repo (for any contributions) A clone of the react.dev repo on your local machine Installation cd react.dev to go into the project root yarn to install the website's npm dependencies Running locally yarn dev to start the development server (powered by Next.js ) open http://localhost:3000 to open the site in your favorite browser Contributing Guidelines The documentation is divided into several sections with a different tone and purpose. If you plan to write more than a few sentences, you might find it helpful to get familiar with the contributing guidelines for the appropriate sections. Create a branch git checkout main from any folder in your local react.dev repository git pull origin main to ensure you have the latest main code git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch (replacing the-name-of-my-branch with a suitable name) to create a branch Make the change Follow the \"Running locally\" instructions Save the files and check in the browser Changes to React components in src will hot-reload Changes to markdown files in content will hot-reload If working with plugins, you may need to remove the .cache directory and restart the server Test the change If possible, test any visual changes in all latest versions of common browsers, on both desktop and mobile. Run yarn check-all . (This will run Prettier, ESLint and validate types.) Push it git add -A && git commit -m \"My message\" (replacing My message with a commit message, such as Fix header logo on Android ) to stage and commit your changes git push my-fork-name the-name-of-my-branch Go to the react.dev repo and you should see recently pushed branches. Follow GitHub's instructions. If possible, include screenshots of visual changes. A preview build is triggered after your changes are pushed to GitHub.
