Email tips@dailymail.com By MADISON BURGESS, JUNIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER Published: 13:44 EST, 4 September 2024 | Updated: 13:52 EST, 4 September 2024 e-mail 37 shares 7 View comments Kate Winslet 's new war film Lee has been slammed by critics, who have branded the flick 'a clunky concoction,' claiming that the actress is 'wasted' on the movie. Lee is a biographical drama telling the story of American ex-model Lee Miller who took photographs of poignant moments during World War II for Vogue magazine. Starring Kate in the titular role, it also boasts Josh O'Connor, Marion Cotillard , Andy Samberg, and Alexander Skarsgard. A year after the movie premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, it is finally on its way for UK audiences and premiered in London's Leicester Square on Tuesday. Here, MailOnline rounds up what the critics have said about it since it's initial release on 9 September 2023. Kate Winslet 's new war film Lee has been slammed by critics, who have branded the flick 'a clunky concoction,' claiming that the actress is 'wasted' on the movie Lee is a biographical drama telling the story of American ex-model Lee Miller who took photographs of poignant moments during World War II for Vogue magazine The Times critic Kevin Maher brutally penned that 'Kate Winslet is wasted' on the movie and 'even she can't save' the biopic, giving it a measly two stars. He wrote: 'It would help, however, if there were fleshed out supporting characters with whom Miller could interact, grow, develop, clash and defy. Instead she's simply surrounded by a plethora of mid-level co-stars with less than nothing to do. 'Perhaps sensing the limited nature of the storytelling, the film's three credited screenwriters have concocted a clunky framing device that's set in Sussex in 1977 and features Josh O'Connor as an incurious reporter who blandly quizzes the elderly Miller (Winslet in latex) in between then and thens.' Adding that: 'Winslet, in turn, is forced to pad out the voiceover with needless bromidic fillers such as, 'The months rolled by…' and 'We drove for miles'. Pictured: Noémie Merlant Alexander Skarsgard, Andrea Riseborough, Kate Winslet and Andy Samberg at the UK Lee premiere Kate Winslet put on a glamorous display as she attended the London premiere of the new war film at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square Lee: What the critics said 'Kate Winslet is wasted on this clunky concoction. The actress is in somewhat of a purple patch at the minute but even she can't save this biopic. ' It would help, however, if there were fleshed out supporting characters with whom Miller could interact, grow, develop, clash and defy. Instead she's simply surrounded by a plethora of mid-level co-stars with less than nothing to d o' - The Times critic Kevin Maher Rating: 'The film plodding along from one Wikipedia paragraph to the next, with little interest if we're enjoying or even paying attention to the lesson. ' Even the structure, with flashbacks interspersed with Miller telling the story to Josh O'Connor's inquisitive interviewer in the 70s, feels expected, and fails to pay off with a strange and unnecessary double twist at the end' - The Guardian critic Benjamin Lee Rating: ' The war scenes speak loudly on their own, with no need to add dramatic emphasis. Alexandre Desplat's score matches that style, with a subtle, piercing beauty. ' If the first half of Lee had been as dazzlingly effective as the second, it might have been a great film instead of a very good one' - BBC Culture critic Caryn James Rating: 'Lee was clunky in parts when it comes to the narrative and plot but it's the characters that really drive home the remarkable emotion and power of this story and I had to wipe away some (read: many) tears as I left the cinema' - Stylist critic Shahed Ezaydi 'Though proficiently realized and expectedly solemn, 'Lee' lacks any formal impetus that can mimic the fury behind the eyes of its heroine. 'What Winslet, also a producer, brings to the screen (a believably complicated cocktail of defiance, fear and despair) feels too honest and emotionally raw for this mannered cinematic portrait of a singular life' - Variety critic Carlos Aguilar ' For many, Lee will be seen as a vehicle for Winslet, and they won't be disappointed by her performance, which, without wishing to jinx this multi-garlanded actor's future, will surely register as one of her best. 'They might, however, have some bones to pick with a film that fully reflects both its subject's bullishness and her many paradoxes' - Deadline critic Damon Wise 'Kuras' film is competent, polished and awards-ready. And while that all makes for a fine viewing experience, the movie also feels at odds with its subject — a restless woman whose passion and hurt drove her to action' - The Hollywood Reporter critic Lovia Gyarkye Advertisement In agreement, with another two-star review, The Guardian critic Benjamin Lee wrote: 'It's been gratifying to watch a star of her stature scale back and choose challenge over comfort but Lee feels closer to the kind of film Winslet would have picked in the heyday of her Oscarbait era.' The critic described the storyline as: 'Plodding along from one Wikipedia paragraph to the next, with little interest if we're enjoying or even paying attention to the lesson.' However, he does praise the actress for making a 'formidable Miller' and 'lifting the film out of anonymity on her shoulders'. BBC Culture's Caryn James on the other hand had high praise for the biopic and awarded it four stars. The critic wrote: 'When she becomes accredited as a journalist by the US military, the film truly comes to match the importance of her work, and gives us the measure of its emotional psychological cost. 'The war scenes speak loudly on their own, with no need to add dramatic emphasis. Alexandre Desplat's score matches that style, with a subtle, piercing beauty. If the first half of Lee had been as dazzlingly effective as the second, it might have been a great film instead of a very good one.' Although, she did critique that it is 'too conventional to match the unconventional Miller, and the film only becomes truly remarkable when its heroine sets off for war'. Kate Winslet 's new war film Lee has divided the opinions of critics - with some slamming the flick as 'a clunky concoction' and others praising it as 'dazzlingly effective' The Guardian critic Benjamin Lee wrote: 'It's been gratifying to watch a star of her stature scale back and choose challenge over comfort but Lee feels closer to the kind of film Winslet would have picked in the heyday of her Oscarbait era' Read More Kate Winslet, Nicholas Hoult and Alexander Skarsgard make swift exit from LEE premiere after party Stylist's Shahed Ezaydi agreed with other critics that 'Lee was clunky in parts when it comes to the narrative and plot'. But argued that it's 'the characters that really drive home the remarkable emotion and power of this story'. The critic was also wowed by Samberg, praising his performance as 'the standout part of this film'. She wrote: 'We typically know him from comedic projects, such as Brooklyn Nine Nine and SNL, but his portrayal of a photographer thrown into a world war and how this changes him as both a man and photographer is truly brilliant – a far cry from his usual funny tendencies.' Discussing Winslet's performance, Deadline critic Damon Wise reasoned: ' For many, Lee will be seen as a vehicle for Winslet, and they won't be disappointed by her performance, which, without wishing to jinx this multi-garlanded actor's future, will surely register as one of her best.' He added: 'They might, however, have some bones to pick with a film that fully reflects both its subject's bullishness and her many paradoxes'. Meanwhile, Variety's critic Carlos Aguilar says that Winslet 'deploys impressive range' and dubs the film as 'respectable'. BBC Culture's Caryn James on the other hand had high praise for the biopic and awarded it four stars Stylist's Shahed Ezaydi was wowed by Samberg, praising his performance as 'the standout part of this film' He penned: ''Lee' lacks any formal impetus that can mimic the fury behind the eyes of its heroine. What Winslet, also a producer, brings to the screen (a believably complicated cocktail of defiance, fear and despair) feels too honest and emotionally raw for this mannered cinematic portrait of a singular life. 'Still, it's partly because of how by-the-numbers the project is that her fantastic interpretation of a woman unconcerned with upholding the status quo stands out so intensely.' The Hollywood Reporter critic Lovia Gyarkye, was impressed with the war film, but said that the structure, 'although effective, seems incongruous with its subject'. They wrote: 'The actress injects award-winning cinematographer Ellen Kuras' glossy and conventional biopic with an energy that ushers an enigmatic figure to the foreground... 'Kuras' film is competent, polished and awards-ready. And while that all makes for a fine viewing experience, the movie also feels at odds with its subject — a restless woman whose passion and hurt drove her to action.'
