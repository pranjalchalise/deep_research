Region of origin Great Britain Lee is a unisex given name from the English word 'lee'. It is also used as a surname, often confused with the Old English surname and given name leah (\"clearing; meadow\"), which evolved to 'leigh' in Middle English, and present-day 'lea' with the same meaning. According to the Social Security Administration's popular baby name database, its popularity peaked in the United States in the early 1900's ranking 39 as a masculine name, and in 1955 ranking 182 as a feminine name. The name's popularity declined steadily in the second half of the 20th century, falling below rank 1000 by 1991 as a feminine name, and to 698 as of 2021 as a masculine name. [ 1 ] In the later 20th century, it also gained some popularity in the United Kingdom , peaking among the 20 most popular boys' names during the 1970s to 1980s, but it had fallen out of the top 100 by 2001. [ 2 ] Lee is also a hypocoristic form of the given names Ashley , Beverly , Kimberley , Leona , and Leslie (all of which are also derived from English placenames containing -leah as a second element; with the possible exception of Leslie, which may be an anglicization of a Gaelic placename).
