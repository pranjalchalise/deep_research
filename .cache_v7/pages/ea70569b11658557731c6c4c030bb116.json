  "data": "Primary Source Set - Franklin Pierce Listen Franklin Pierce was the 14th President of the United States, serving from 1853 to 1857. He was the only president to come from New Hampshire. He was born and raised in Hillsborough and later moved to Concord. Background Before he became president, Pierce was actively involved in his community, first as a lawyer and then as a politician. He served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate. Pierce dominated the Democratic Party in New Hampshire during the 1830s and 1840s, when Democrats controlled the state’s political affairs. He also became an influential figure in the Democratic Party nationally. Throughout his career, Pierce believed ardently that the federal union between the states must be preserved at all costs. Although he was personally opposed to slavery, he argued that slavery was protected in the U.S. Constitution and therefore the federal government must support it. In the 1830s, many political leaders shared this view, but public opinion began to shift in the 1840s, making Pierce’s position less popular among his northern colleagues. However, many still viewed him as a compromise between northern interests and those of the southern states—he was, after all, a northerner who was sympathetic to the South. He was a dark horse candidate for the presidency in 1852, but when the Democrats could not settle on another nominee, Pierce became their man on the 49th ballot. He won the general election with 51% of the popular vote and a strong majority in the electoral college. After becoming president, Pierce faced a number of insurmountable problems as sectional tensions threatened to rip the country apart. Even the members of his own cabinet did not get along. In an effort to please everyone, Pierce ended up pleasing no one. In 1854, he signed into law the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed people living in the Kansas and Nebraska territories to vote on whether their states would allow slavery. The act overturned the 1820 Missouri Compromise that had essentially divided the country in half between slave and free states. The Kansas-Nebraska Act reopened this question and ushered in a period of violence in Kansas between the slave and free factions. The territory became known as “Bleeding Kansas,” and the fighting that occurred there would foreshadow the events of the Civil War (1861–65). As president, Pierce supported the slave faction in Kansas, which infuriated his northern supporters. He also backed several other failed or controversial proposals during his four years in office, although the Kansas-Nebraska Act is considered his most significant failure. As tumultuous as Pierce’s presidency had been, his personal life too was not without tragedy. None of his children survived childhood, and the last, his 11-year-old son Benny, died in a train accident just two months before Pierce took office. Pierce’s wife, Jane, never recovered from the loss and struggled to act as Pierce’s official hostess during his term in the White House. The couple became close with Pierce’s secretary of war, Jefferson Davis, and his wife Varina. (Davis would later become the president of the Confederacy during the Civil War.) By the time Pierce left the U.S. presidency in 1857, he could claim that he had helped America expand farther westward, but he had only made worse the sectional tension regarding slavery. Pierce’s party turned against him, and he was not nominated by the Democrats for re-election to the presidency at the end of his term. He returned to Concord in 1857 and continued to publicly argue that the preservation of the Union was more important than the abolition of slavery. Although he still had some supporters, many objected to Pierce’s position, and after Pierce’s death in 1869, there was a fair amount of controversy over how he should be commemorated in New Hampshire. A statue was not erected to him on the state house lawn until 1914. This primary source set guide can be used in several ways to explore the life of Franklin Pierce.

Biographies Documents Maps & Charts Objects Photographs & Prints Biographies in this Primary Source Set: Franklin Pierce Listen Biography Franklin Pierce 1804–1869 Caption: Franklin Pierce was the 19th president of the United States and the only president from New Hampshire. He was born and raised in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, and later moved to Concord. He was a lawyer and a politician. Before he was elected president, he represented New Hampshire in the U.S. Congress. He also served in the U.S. Army in the Mexican-American War. He was president for one term, from 1853 to 1857. This was a very difficult time for the United States. There was a lot of tension between the North and the South over slavery. President Pierce thought it was more important to keep the country together than to abolish slavery. He tried to find a compromise between the two sides, but it did not work and made the problems worse.

He and his wife became friends with Franklin and Jane Pierce when they all lived in Washington, D.C., when Pierce and Davis were in the U.S. Congress. When Pierce became president of the United States in 1853, he asked Davis to join his government as the secretary of war. Pierce only served one term as president, and then returned to New Hampshire. He and Davis kept in touch. As the country became more and more divided, southern states started seceding from, or leaving, the United States. Davis wrote this letter to Pierce right after Mississippi seceded from the United States. One month later, Davis became president of the Confederate States of America.

Image Credit: New Hampshire Historical Society Pierce's Inaugural Address Listen Document Pierce's Inaugural Address 1853 Printed by John Murphy Company Caption: American presidents are elected every four years in November, but they are inaugurated—officially take office—a few months later. They have to swear an oath that they will follow the Constitution. Today, presidents are inaugurated in January, but before the 1930s, inaugurations were in March. Since the time of George Washington, presidents have given a speech after they take the oath of office. The speech, called an inaugural address, usually describes their plans for their presidency. This document is a printing of Franklin Pierce's inaugural address. People could buy it as a keepsake or memory of the time.

Image Credit: From the collections of the New Hampshire State Library Maps & Charts in this Primary Source Set: Free States and Slave States Listen Maps & Charts Free States and Slave States Caption: During the 1800s, the United States expanded west from the 13 original colonies into a much larger nation. Before the Civil War, whenever a new territory or state joined the United States, there was a big debate over whether slavery would be allowed there. In 1820, it was decided that there would be no more slavery north of the southern border of Missouri. In 1850, it was decided that the people who lived in the New Mexico territory and Utah territory should be allowed to vote on whether they would have slavery, even though some of that land was north of the 1820 line. In 1854, when Franklin Pierce was president of the United States, he signed a law called the Kansas-Nebraska Act. This allowed people who lived in the Kansas and Nebraska territories to vote on whether they would have slavery. This expansion of slavery into new parts of the United States angered people who were opposed to slavery, and helped set the stage for the Civil War.

The new law allowed new states to choose whether they would permit slavery or not. This angered people who were opposed to slavery, and helped set the stage for the Civil War.
