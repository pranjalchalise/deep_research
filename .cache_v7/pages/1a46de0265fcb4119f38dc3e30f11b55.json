The mean difference in rainfall between the two epochs (average rainfall in the 1981–1995 period: 5.0 mm day⁻¹; average rainfall in the 1996–2010 period: 6.0 mm day⁻¹) was significant at the 95% confidence level. This study explored the cause of the recent increase in summer rainfall in central eastern China by analyzing the difference in average rainfall between 1996–2010 (hereafter, Epoch II) and 1981–1995 (hereafter, Epoch I). Analysis of rainfall revealed that positive anomalies were observed in a southwest–northeast direction across the south-central region of eastern China, Korea, and Japan, while negative anomalies were observed at latitudes of 40–50°N and in most areas in the western North Pacific region. These findings suggest that summer rainfall in central eastern China is part of East Asian summer monsoons and have an out-of-phase relationship with western North Pacific monsoons. To identify the cause of the recent increase in summer rainfall in central eastern China, the difference in 850 hPa stream functions between Epoch II and Epoch I was analyzed. This study found that anomalous huge anticyclonic circulations were strengthened in the western North Pacific region and anomalous cyclonic circulations were strengthened in the south-central region of eastern China. As a result, anomalous northeasterlies originating from anomalous cyclones centered on Lake Baikal and anomalous southerlies originating from anomalous cyclones in the south-central area of eastern China joined in central eastern China. The typical anomalous atmospheric circulations in the negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase and the average PDO index and summer rainfall in central eastern China from June to August exhibited a high negative correlation, which was presumed to have been present since the previous winter.

In order to examine the cause of the positive correlation between the two variables, the 14 years with the highest SASM index (positive SASM years) and the 14 years with the lowest SASM index (negative SASM years) were selected from a total of 39 years (1977–2015) and the mean difference between the two periods was analysed. In the positive SASM years, more TCs were generated in most of the western North Pacific region and tended to move in a northerly direction from the far northeastern sea of the Philippines towards Korea via the East China Sea. In the negative SASM years, TCs moved westward from the eastern sea of the Philippine to the southern coast of China and the Indochinese Peninsula via the South China Sea. A similar result is found in further comparisons in which years with strong El Niño‐Southern Oscillations are removed. Anomalous westerlies from the Mascarene High moved eastward, thereby forming anomalous cyclonic circulations in the western North Pacific. Thus, the Mascarene High played a decisive role in strengthening anomalous cyclonic circulations in the western North Pacific. This finding was verified by examining various environmental factors that affected TC genesis and the correlation analyses between the 850‐hPa geopotential height and the western North Pacific TC genesis frequency during the June–August period in addition to an analysis of the velocity potential and divergent winds.

The WNPSM is an essential part of the Asian summer monsoon system, significantly influencing East Asian rainfall (Wang et al., 2001). Choi and Kim (2020) and Zhao et al. (2019) noted that the relationship between the WNPSM and the frequency of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific has intensified over the past few decades. However, whether the enhanced WPNSM is related to ASI loss needs to be systematically analyzed using numerical models. ...

Such an impact from ENSO, however, is not clear during positive PDO years. Choi and Kim [49] also pointed out that the superposition of the circulations associated with PDO and ENSO can lead to different frequencies of TCs affecting Korea. Furthermore, there seems to be a difference before and after 1981. ...

South Korea, situated within the East Asian monsoon region, has also experienced increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, marked by a rise in short-duration but high-intensity summer rainfall events. This escalation is primarily driven by atmospheric factors such as Changma, the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), tropical cyclones and moisture-laden atmospheric rivers (Choi et al. 2020; Do et al. 2023;Jung et al. 2001;Park et al. 2021). ...

Instead, they either make landfall over Korea (∼10.5%) or continue over the ocean. Choi and Kim (2019) also reported the negative relationship between PDO index and TC landfall frequency over Korea.

Most of these publications have focused on long-term changes related to late-season WNP TCs. Several common TC metrics (e.g., frequency, intensity, lifespan and accumulated cyclone energy) have significantly decreased during the late season since the late 1970s or the early 1980s (Chang et al., 2021; Choi et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2021;Hsu et al., 2014). There have also been fewer category 4-5 (e.g., LMI≥113 kt) TCs and fewer rapid intensification events during the late season (Shan et al., 2023). ...

Meanwhile, research on changes in relative humidity on a local level has been actively conducted to evaluate the contribution level of each factor triggering an urban heat island (Inoue et al., 2004;Park et al., 2011;Takane et al., 2011;Kim et al., 2013). Generally, the factor with the highest level of contribution to an urban heat island is assessed to be the decrease in evaporation source accompanying the paving of the earth's surface (Landsberg, 1981; Park et al., 2007 Park et al., , 2010Kai, 2012). The most common method to appraise the effect of the decrease in evaporation amount in urban areas is to assess the trend of urban dryness. ...

Hence, studies on effective policies as well as analysis and assessment methods of the urban thermal environment have been conducted. These studies have included an evaluation method of the spatial characteristics for creating wind ventilation paths in Daegu region [16], the expansion and operation of the policy 'clean-road system' for spraying water on roads [17] and an analysis of the thermal environment based on satellite images and Automatic Weather System (AWS) data [18]. In addition to efforts by vulnerable local governments to reduce excessive heat events and to manage the impacts of climate change, the Korean government has established the 'comprehensive basic plan for climate change response' and the 'comprehensive national adaptation plan for climate change' to respond and adapt to climate change at the legal level. ...
