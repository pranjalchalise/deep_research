The U.S. title of Lee's second film, Fist of Fury , was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural Fists . However, the titles were accidentally reversed. The Big Boss was released as Fists of Fury and Fist of Fury became The Chinese Connection . [ 1 ] ^ In the United States and Canada, the film earned $2.4 million in theatrical rentals .
