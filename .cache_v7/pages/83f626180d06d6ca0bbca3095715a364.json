Ask Question Asked 8 years ago Modified 8 months ago Viewed 449 times 3 I regularly use a short start/stop/continue-survey on my students to be able to improve my teaching skills. I get a lot of informative data that helps me, but there's a lot of work involved in digging that information out by hand. Does anyone have any best practice recommendations on how to handle open-ended feedback? Is there a way of using text analytics to show points of strong consensus? teaching feedback technology course-evaluation Share Improve this question Follow asked Jan 22, 2018 at 13:14 Viktor Nordmark 81 5 5 bronze badges Add a comment | 1 Answer 1 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 1 I do something similar every semester, with a Google form. I ask students a combination of questions, some on a Likert scale and some open-ended. The former are nice because Google Forms will summarize the responses in pie charts and I can show those to the class as a whole (which helps unhappy students see that the vast majority of other students disagree with them and support the way I'm running the course). For a large class, it might be worth making the start/stop/continue into buttons so that Google forms can summarize the responses. I tend to learn much more from the open-ended questions and regularly find myself in the same position at the OP. I prefer to read all the responses and jot down trends as I go, which I then discuss with the class as a whole. I think it's wise to actually make changes based on student suggestions, or to explain why I'm not making changes if a large fraction of students commented on something. But my classes are around 20 students so it's not too much work to read all the feedback. If you want to streamline this, there's anecdotal evidence that Chat GPT is ok at figuring out the patterns and summarizing the feedback as a whole. A colleague of mine uses it for this purpose and directed my attention to the following blog post about that use of AI (it's number 31 on that list). But, personally, I still prefer to read the feedback myself, figure out the patterns as I do, and tally up how many students made comments about each pattern.
