It requires not only the precise integration of facts but also the maintenance of thematic coherence throughout the article. Existing methods, such as direct generation and multi-agent discussion, often struggle with issues like hallucinations, topic incoherence, and significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose RaPID , an efficient retrieval-augmented long text generation framework. RaPID consists of three main modules: (1) Retrieval-augmented preliminary outline generation to reduce hallucinations, (2) Attribute-constrained search for efficient information discovery, (3) Plan-guided article generation for enhanced coherence. Extensive experiments on our newly compiled benchmark dataset, FreshWiki-2024, demonstrate that RaPID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of evaluation metrics ( e.g., long-text generation, outline quality, latency, etc). Our work provides a robust and efficient solution to the challenges of automated long-text generation. RaPID : Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Long Text Generation with Writing Planning and Information Discovery 1 1 footnotetext: Corresponding authors. 1 Introduction Figure 1: An example of generating a wiki-style article using various methods highlights distinct challenges and considerations. Direct generation may suffer from the large model’s limited internal knowledge. While methods based on multi-agent discussions can provide broad coverage of the topic, they may also result in increased hallucinations and reduced efficiency. Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased significant proficiency in handling various natural language tasks (Chen et al., 2024a ; Hu et al., 2024 ; Chen et al., 2024b ) , achieving near-human performance in tasks like summarizing lengthy documents (Liu et al., 2024b ) and crafting poetry (Yu et al., 2024 ) . Despite these achievements, generating long and knowledge-intensive texts ( e.g., encyclopedia articles) faces significant challenge (Shen et al., 2023 ) . Such tasks demand not only the seamless integration of facts and narratives over extensive text but also the maintenance of thematic and stylistic consistency throughout the document. Bai et al. ( 2024 ) focus on fine-tuning LLMs to generate long-text solely based on LLMs’ internal knowledge. However, limited LLM’s internal knowledge You et al. ( 2023 ) can lead to significant hallucinations in its generation, as evident in Figure 1 . Such phenomenon is further exacerbated when generating with fact-intensive content Rawte et al. ( 2023 ) . To address these issues, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques are commonly utilized to provide LLMs with additional retrieved content (Jiang et al., 2024b ) . Nonetheless, the effectiveness and scope of retrieved content can significantly influence the quality of generated long texts (Shao et al., 2024 ) . Moreover, RAG-based long text generation relies on multiple rounds of retrieval, formulating dedicated search queries, and obtaining characteristic content for different sections. This can cause thematic and stylistic inconsistency between sections Zhou et al. ( 2023 ) . A more effective approach is to mimic human writing practices (Rohman, 1965 ; Doyle and Center, 1994 ) , directing LLMs to develop a structured outline prior to full-text generation. A recent work, STORM (Shao et al., 2024 ) introduces a novel long-text generation strategy based on multi-agent discussions. This approach identifies multiple perspectives on each topic and uncovers information through interactions among agents assigned distinct roles, resulting in better performance compared to direct RAG-based methods. Despite its promising results, long text generation based on multi-agent disscussion faces three challenges as follows: (1) writing intentions are often general and ambiguous , but agents are constrained by the internal knowledge of LLMs, making it highly possible to misinterpret the writing intention from the very beginning and generate hallucinations. (2) agent interactions lack self-correction mechanisms , leading to a failure to detect hallucinations and allowing ineffective discussions to perpetuate errors unchecked. (3) long texts inherently involve intricate long-range dependencies and complex logical structures . Consequently, maintaining consistency and accuracy throughout the generation process remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose RaPID , an efficient R etrieval- A ugmented long text generation framework with writing P lanning and I nformation D iscovery. Specifically, (1) we design a retrieval-augmented outline generation module. We first establish an outline corpus containing approximately 2.6 million example outlines from Wikipedia, covering a diverse range of topics and structures. Given a question, it is disambiguated via results from web search, and the refined intent is used to retrieve outline examples from established outline corpus. These outline examples are used as context for high-quality outline generation. (2) To comprehensively gather information across multiple topics, we extract attributes from the outline. We maintain a comprehensive attribute buffer and convert the extracted attributes into search queries for attribute-constrained search. The collected information contributes to iteratively updating the outline and serves as reference material to support the generation of the final long text. (3) Most importantly, we design a novel structured writing plan. It is derived from the outline, to guide full article generation. Specifically, the writing plan is a topological graph that plots section dependencies and writing sequences. Our contributions are summarized as follows: • We revisit the automated knowledge-intensive long text generation, particularly focusing on the unified consideration of pre-writing and generation stages for generating wiki-style articles. • We propose RaPID , a framework that leverages retrieval-augmented outline generation, efficient information discovery, and logic writing plan guidance to generate comprehensive and knowledge-intensive articles. • We construct a new dataset, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RaPID in terms of factuality and coherence. 2 Related Works Long-form Text Generation Long-form text generation (Tan et al., 2021 ; Guan et al., 2021 ; Yang et al., 2022 ) has been a significant focus in NLP research, even prior to the emergence of large language models. Recently, researchers have achieved considerable success in various applications of long text generation using LLMs, including creative writing (Lei et al., 2024 ; Li et al., 2024 ; Yang et al., 2023 ) , scientific survey (Kang and Xiong, 2024 ; Wang et al., 2024 ) and expository writing (Balepur et al., 2023 ) . Previous efforts to enhance long text generation have often involved improving models’ abilities to produce extended outputs by constructing crafted SFT dataset Xu et al. ( 2024 ) . This paper, however, primarily focuses on generating knowledge-intensive long articles based on topic retrieval. For instance, Shao et al. ( 2024 ) proposed a pre-writing method that utilizes perspective-guided questioning and outline generation, which automates wiki-style article generation from scratch. Building on this foundation, Jiang et al. ( 2024a ) introduced a multi-agent dialogue and user interaction mechanism, which further enhances the large language model’s ability to explore unknown unknowns. Additionally, Pham et al. ( 2024 ) and Bai et al. ( 2024 ) proposed to enhance the ability of LLMs to directly generate long outputs by improving LLM alignment methods. However, these methods still face challenges related to hallucinations, efficiency, and consistency, which are the primary focus of optimization in this paper. Retrieval Augmented Generation Retrieval-Augmented Generation Lewis et al. ( 2020 ) represents an innovative approach that integrates the advantages of information retrieval with language generation. The performance of RAG heavily depends on the accuracy of the retrieved information (Mallen et al., 2023 ) . Some works improve retrieval performance through adaptive retrieval (Asai et al., 2023 ; Liu et al., 2024a ) or query rewriting (Gao et al., 2023 ; Ma et al., 2023 ) . More recently, Edge et al. ( 2024 ) proposes to enhance the accuracy of RAG by automatically building knowledge graphs. Although these methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in short-format output tasks (Joshi et al., 2017 ; Yang et al., 2018 ) , they remain inadequate for application in knowledge-intensive long text generation tasks, which usually require multi-faceted information retrieval and fine-grained information filtering. Figure 2: The framework of RaPID , which consists of three main stages: (a) Retrieval-Augmented Outline Generation, where an initial outline is created based on a brief introduction and examples; (b) Attribute-Constrained Search, which leverages an attribute-based mechanism to discover relevant information and refine the outline accordingly; and (c) Plan-Guided Article Generation, where a structured writing plan is developed based on dependencies between sections, resulting in a more coherent and fluent article. The blue dashed lines illustrate how the outline evolves throughout the processes of information discovery and writing planning. 3 Methods In this section, we introduce RaPID , an efficient and effective framework for automated wiki-style article generation. We first formulate the article generation problem in Section 3.1 . Next, we detail the retrieval-augmented outline generation process in Section 3.2 , the attribute-constrained search in Section 3.3 , and plan-guided long-text generation in Section 3.4 . The overall framework of RaPID is illustrated in Figure 2 . 3.1 Problem Formulation The goal of this task is to automatically generate a comprehensive wiki-style article, denoted as 𝒟 𝒟 \\mathcal{D} caligraphic_D , based on a given topic t 𝑡 t italic_t . This process involves generating a clear outline and crafting coherent sections that thoroughly explore the topic. Formally, the task includes three main steps: (i) Initial outline generation: given a topic t 𝑡 t italic_t , we first generate an initial outline 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT related to t 𝑡 t italic_t , (ii) Information gathering and update: we then use the search engine to collect a diverse set of information from the knowledge source 𝒮 𝒮 \\mathcal{S} caligraphic_S as the reference ℛ ℛ \\mathcal{R} caligraphic_R and iteratively refine 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to produce the final outline 𝒪 𝒪 \\mathcal{O} caligraphic_O ; (iii) Article crafting: finally, the complete article 𝒟 𝒟 \\mathcal{D} caligraphic_D is generated by elaborating on the final outline 𝒪 𝒪 \\mathcal{O} caligraphic_O using the reference ℛ ℛ \\mathcal{R} caligraphic_R . 3.2 Retrieval Augmented Outline Generation “Well begun is half done.” A clear and logically coherent outline is crucial for the writing process, which serves as a roadmap to guide the detailed content unfold in appropriate places and to ensure overall cohesion (Fan and Gardent, 2022 ) . However, existing methods rely on generating an initial outline using the model’s internal knowledge, which will inevitably introduce inaccuracies or misconceptions. This outline is then iteratively refined through RAG. However, such inaccuracies may escalate as the writing progresses, leading to topic deviations. To address this, we employ retrieval-augmented generation during the initial outline generation phase to improve writing intent recognition and reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we retrieve similar topic outline examples from a curated corpus, generating a high-quality preliminary outline that is further refined through an efficient information retrieval module. Intent recognition. To reduce ambiguity, we begin by using an intention recognition module to clarify intentions and maintain focus. Specifically, for a given topic t 𝑡 t italic_t , we first query a search engine for relevant information and then generate an initial summary of the results. This process is formalized as follows: 𝒮 t = Sch ⁢ ( t , 𝒮 ) ⁢ and ⁢ I brief = LLM ⁢ ( t , 𝒮 t ) subscript 𝒮 𝑡 Sch 𝑡 𝒮 and subscript 𝐼 brief LLM 𝑡 subscript 𝒮 𝑡 \\mathcal{S}_{t}=\\texttt{Sch}(t,\\mathcal{S})\\text{ and }I_{\\text{brief}}=% \\texttt{LLM}(t,\\mathcal{S}_{t}) caligraphic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = Sch ( italic_t , caligraphic_S ) and italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT brief end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = LLM ( italic_t , caligraphic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) (1) where I brief subscript 𝐼 brief I_{\\text{brief}} italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT brief end_POSTSUBSCRIPT represents the brief summary of the topic, and 𝒮 t subscript 𝒮 𝑡 \\mathcal{S}_{t} caligraphic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT denotes the search results obtained by the search engine Sch from the knowledge base 𝒮 𝒮 \\mathcal{S} caligraphic_S . Outline example retrieval. To improve the quality of the generated initial outline, we retrieve high-quality outline examples from a curated corpus based on the given topic, which serve as few-shot examples for outline generation. Specifically, to construct the corpus 𝒞 𝒞 \\mathcal{C} caligraphic_C , we extract outlines from the extensively crawled structured articles in the Wiki archives 1 1 1 https://dumps.wikimedia.org/ . We then concatenate the topic t 𝑡 t italic_t and its brief summary I brief subscript 𝐼 brief I_{\\text{brief}} italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT brief end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to facilitate query expansion, and use a dense retriever Ret 1 subscript Ret 1 \\texttt{Ret}_{1} Ret start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to retrieve similar topics from the constructed Wiki corpus 𝒞 𝒞 \\mathcal{C} caligraphic_C . We denote these retrieved topics as 𝕋 = { t 1 ′ , t 2 ′ , … , t n ′ } 𝕋 subscript superscript 𝑡 ′ 1 subscript superscript 𝑡 ′ 2 … subscript superscript 𝑡 ′ 𝑛 \\mathbb{T}=\\{t^{\\prime}_{1},t^{\\prime}_{2},...,t^{\\prime}_{n}\\} blackboard_T = { italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } , with their corresponding outlines 𝕆 = { 𝒪 1 ′ , 𝒪 2 ′ , … , 𝒪 n ′ } 𝕆 subscript superscript 𝒪 ′ 1 subscript superscript 𝒪 ′ 2 … subscript superscript 𝒪 ′ 𝑛 \\mathbb{O}=\\{\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}_{1},\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}_{2},...,\\mathcal{O}% ^{\\prime}_{n}\\} blackboard_O = { caligraphic_O start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , caligraphic_O start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , caligraphic_O start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } . We have: ( 𝕋 , 𝕆 ) = Ret 1 ⁢ ( t , I brief , 𝒞 ) 𝕋 𝕆 subscript Ret 1 𝑡 subscript 𝐼 brief 𝒞 (\\mathbb{T},\\mathbb{O})=\\texttt{Ret}_{1}(t,I_{\\text{brief}},\\mathcal{C}) ( blackboard_T , blackboard_O ) = Ret start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_t , italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT brief end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , caligraphic_C ) (2) After retrieval, we combine the topic t 𝑡 t italic_t , summary I brief subscript 𝐼 brief I_{\\text{brief}} italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT brief end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as the reference context, and the retrieved outlines 𝕋 𝕋 \\mathbb{T} blackboard_T and 𝕆 𝕆 \\mathbb{O} blackboard_O as few-shot examples to instruct LLM to generate the initial outline, denoted as 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT : 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i = LLM ⁢ ( t , 𝒮 t , 𝕋 , 𝕆 ) subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 LLM 𝑡 subscript 𝒮 𝑡 𝕋 𝕆 \\mathcal{O}_{ini}=\\texttt{LLM}(t,\\mathcal{S}_{t},\\mathbb{T},\\mathbb{O}) caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = LLM ( italic_t , caligraphic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , blackboard_T , blackboard_O ) (3) 3.3 Attribute-Constrained Search After generating the initial outline 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , we design an attribute-constrained information collection module to enhance the efficiency and comprehensiveness of information gathering, further refining the 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to produce the final outline 𝒪 𝒪 \\mathcal{O} caligraphic_O . Attribute & Query Generation. In the process of generating long-form text, it is crucial to ensure that the content is comprehensive and relevant. To this end, we introduce the concept of attributes. Each attribute is defined as a distinct, indivisible concept to prevent overly complex queries, thereby effectively summarizing the essential information for writing the full article. By breaking down the outline into distinct attributes, we can focus on capturing the most pertinent details without introducing overwhelming complexity. We prompt LLM to extract the possible attribute from the current outline 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and maintain an attribute buffer, 𝒜 𝒜 \\mathcal{A} caligraphic_A . Such buffer encompasses the key aspects necessary for composing the final article. We then prompt LLM to transform the attributes into queries, 𝒬 𝒬 \\mathcal{Q} caligraphic_Q , that are related to the article’s title and are suitable for search engine retrieval 2 2 2 Note that such attributes can also be directly provided or modified by humans to guide relevant retrieval during long-form text generation, incorporating points that are of interest or that they wish to highlight. . The collected information will be added into the reference set ℛ ℛ \\mathcal{R} caligraphic_R . We have: 𝒜 = LLM ⁢ ( 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i ) , 𝒬 = LLM ⁢ ( 𝒜 ) ⁢ and ⁢ ℛ = Sch ⁢ ( 𝒬 , 𝒮 ) formulae-sequence 𝒜 LLM subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 𝒬 LLM 𝒜 and ℛ Sch 𝒬 𝒮 \\mathcal{A}=\\texttt{LLM}(\\mathcal{O}_{ini}),\\mathcal{Q}=\\texttt{LLM}(\\mathcal{% A})\\text{ and }\\mathcal{R}=\\texttt{Sch}(\\mathcal{Q},\\mathcal{S}) caligraphic_A = LLM ( caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , caligraphic_Q = LLM ( caligraphic_A ) and caligraphic_R = Sch ( caligraphic_Q , caligraphic_S ) (4) We have fully parallelized the search process to enhance the efficiency. The example queries are then selectively merged into a set of queries 𝒬 𝒬 \\mathcal{Q} caligraphic_Q by a LLM. The merged queries 𝒬 ′ superscript 𝒬 ′ \\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime} caligraphic_Q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT are used in parallel with search engines to gather information, which serves as references ℛ ℛ \\mathcal{R} caligraphic_R for the outline refinement and subsequent writing process. This attribute-constrained approach is highly parallelized, enabling effective and efficient information gathering. Outline Refinement To further align the initial outline 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with the desired structure, we provide the LLMs with the titles of all references from ℛ ℛ \\mathcal{R} caligraphic_R and instruct LLMs to generate modifications to 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . These modifications can include actions such as [add section] , [delete section] , or [do nothing] , ensuring that the outline aligns with the most current information and insights available. We will iterate the outline refinement process until the attribute buffer 𝒜 𝒜 \\mathcal{A} caligraphic_A and outline converge, or the search limits are reached. Thus, the final outline 𝒪 𝒪 \\mathcal{O} caligraphic_O is generated based on 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 \\mathcal{O}_{ini} caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ℛ ℛ \\mathcal{R} caligraphic_R : 𝒪 = LLM ⁢ ( 𝒪 i ⁢ n ⁢ i , ℛ ) 𝒪 LLM subscript 𝒪 𝑖 𝑛 𝑖 ℛ \\mathcal{O}=\\texttt{LLM}(\\mathcal{O}_{ini},\\mathcal{R}) caligraphic_O = LLM ( caligraphic_O start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_n italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , caligraphic_R ) (5) 3.4 Plan-Guided Article Generation Plan Generation Existing methods directly generate the article based on outline 𝒪 𝒪 \\mathcal{O} caligraphic_O , such a simple one-way writing logic may cause the content to gradually deviate from the initial section. A long article has a relatively complex structure, with interdependencies between sections. To maintain the overall coherence and consistency, we introduce an additional writing plan, denoted as 𝒫 𝒫 \\mathcal{P} caligraphic_P , which provides a carefully planned writing order derived from the outline 𝒪 𝒪 \\mathcal{O} caligraphic_O . Specifically, we first extract all the first-level section titles from 𝒪 𝒪 \\mathcal{O} caligraphic_O , denoted as { s 1 , s 2 , … , s m } subscript 𝑠 1 subscript 𝑠 2 … subscript 𝑠 𝑚 \\{s_{1},s_{2},\\dots,s_{m}\\} { italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } . We then define the “dependency” of a section as the content from other sections that must be referenced before developing that particular section, ensuring a logical flow and integration throughout the article. Leveraging the planning capabilities of LLMs, we construct plan 𝒫 𝒫 \\mathcal{P} caligraphic_P by providing human-written few-shot examples. Specifically, the plan 𝒫 𝒫 \\mathcal{P} caligraphic_P consists of a list that defines the dependencies of each section, with “None\" indicating no dependencies on other sections. We then calculate its topological order to ensure the feasibility of the plan, and the full article is generated section by section according to this order. In the rare instances where the generation of 𝒫 𝒫 \\mathcal{P} caligraphic_P fails, we will revert to the more conventional approach of generating each section in parallel. The generation of the particular section s i subscript 𝑠 𝑖 s_{i} italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be formulated as: 𝒫 𝒫 \\displaystyle\\mathcal{P} caligraphic_P = LLM ⁢ ( { s 1 , s 2 , … , s m } ) , absent LLM subscript 𝑠 1 subscript 𝑠 2 … subscript 𝑠 𝑚 \\displaystyle=\\texttt{LLM}(\\{s_{1},s_{2},\\dots,s_{m}\\}), = LLM ( { italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } ) , ℛ s i subscript ℛ subscript 𝑠 𝑖 \\displaystyle\\mathcal{R}_{s_{i}} caligraphic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = Ret 1 ⁢ ( s i , 𝒫 , ℛ , 𝒪 ) , absent subscript Ret 1 subscript 𝑠 𝑖 𝒫 ℛ 𝒪 \\displaystyle=\\texttt{Ret}_{1}(s_{i},\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{R},\\mathcal{O}), = Ret start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , caligraphic_P , caligraphic_R , caligraphic_O ) , (6) s i subscript 𝑠 𝑖 \\displaystyle s_{i} italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = LLM ⁢ ( t , 𝒫 , 𝒪 , ℛ s i ) . absent LLM 𝑡 𝒫 𝒪 subscript ℛ subscript 𝑠 𝑖 \\displaystyle=\\texttt{LLM}(t,\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{O},\\mathcal{R}_{s_{i}}). = LLM ( italic_t , caligraphic_P , caligraphic_O , caligraphic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) . where ℛ s i subscript ℛ subscript 𝑠 𝑖 \\mathcal{R}_{s_{i}} caligraphic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT represents the references retrieved from ℛ ℛ \\mathcal{R} caligraphic_R that are needed to generate s i subscript 𝑠 𝑖 s_{i} italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . After generating all the sections, we follow established methodologies by concatenating them to create a comprehensive summary of the topic. This process culminates in the creation of a complete wiki-style article. 4 Experiments 4.1 Dataset To evaluate the capabilities of RaPID , we introduce the FreshWiki-2024 dataset, a chronological extension of the original FreshWiki dataset (Shao et al., 2024 ) which consists of human-authored Wikipedia articles covering 100 distinct topics. To address temporal data contamination concerns, FreshWiki-2024 follows the rigorous curation protocol of its predecessor and only includes Wikipedia entries revised during 2024, ensuring all evaluation materials postdate conventional model training cutoffs. For robust performance evaluation, we randomly selected 100 representative topics from FreshWiki-2024 to evaluate both RaPID and baseline methods.

The best results of each metric are marked in bold . LLM Evaluation uses an LLM to assess the generated articles across four different dimensions. The LLM Evaluation uses a 1-5 scale. Similarity assesses the resemblance between generated and real articles. Factuality evaluates the quantity and accuracy of facts in the generated content. Info Diversity evaluates the diversity of the searched information. 4.2 Baselines We compared RaPID with several different LLM-based methods: • RAG : It generates an outline or full article based on the information retrieved from a search related to the writing topic. • Outline-driven RAG (oRAG) : Building upon RAG, this method first generates an outline. It then uses the section titles to retrieve additional relevant information and generates the full article, section by section, using the retrieved content. • STORM (Shao et al., 2024 ) : A writing system designed to generate wiki-style articles from scratch. It majors in the pre-writing stage by generating the outline through retrieval and perspective-guided question-asking. • Co-STORM (Jiang et al., 2024a ) : An enhanced version of STORM that incorporates user interaction and multi-agent discussion, further improving the exploration of previously unknown aspects within the topic. 4.3 Evaluation Metrics Outline Quality. To objectively assess outline generation quality, we propose an evaluation framework based on section title alignment. Rather than employing NER-based metrics as in STORM (refer to Appendix B.1 for its limitations), we perform direct string matching between generated section titles and human-authored ground truth titles. We calculate recall, precision, and F1 score, providing a balanced assessment of outline comprehensiveness and conciseness. Article Quality. Evaluating long-form text generation remains a challenging task. To comprehensively assess the quality of generated articles, we consider four key aspects: (1) Similarity : We use Rouge Lin ( 2004 ) scores and entity recall from a FLAIR NER model Akbik et al. ( 2019 ) to compare the similarity between generated articles and human-written articles. (2) Factuality : We also assess the factual accuracy of the generated articles. Specifically, we employ FActScore (Min et al., 2023 ) , an automated long-text factuality evaluation framework based on LLMs. We report the precision and the number of claims of FActScore. Additionally, we include F1@300 as defined in FactAlign (Huang and Chen, 2024 ) , to penalize articles that contain few factual statements. (3) LLM Evaluation : To evaluate the quality of generated articles at the article level, we utilized Prometheus-7b-v2.0 (Kim et al., 2024 ) , an open-source model that supports a 5-point rubric for text evaluation. We employed the same version of the criteria used by STORM, focusing on four aspects: Interest , Organization , Relevance , and Coverage . (4) Diversity : We measure the diversity of collected information using the info diversity metric proposed by CoSTORM, which quantifies the variety of information included in the generated articles. Further details on the evaluation metrics can be found in Appendix B.2 . 4.4 Implementation Details We implemented RaPID using the DSPy framework 3 3 3 https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy , with all prompts detailed in Appendix C . Three foundation models were employed as backbones: gpt-4o-2024-11-20 , qwen-max-2024-09-19 , and deepseek-v3 . For web search functionality across all methods, we integrated the Google Custom Search API 4 4 4 https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview , retrieving the top-5 most relevant results per query to balance precision and computational overhead. To prevent data leakage, we explicitly excluded official Wikipedia pages related to target topics during web search and outline retrieval. We implemented Ret 1 subscript Ret 1 \\texttt{Ret}_{1} Ret start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Ret 2 subscript Ret 2 \\texttt{Ret}_{2} Ret start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT using e5-large-v2 (Wang et al., 2022 ) and paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019 ) , respectively. The Wikipedia dump 5 5 5 https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html (version 2024-08-01) served as the retrieval corpus for outline generation. We have made both the original Wikipedia dump and the FreshWiki-2024 dataset publicly available 6 6 6 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GNWE0ZEPijFpdjuPOfWLjWwEcQYq3Kz2?usp=sharing . 5 Results and Analysis 5.1 Main Results Table 1 presents the article quality evaluation of RaPID across different foundation models. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over baseline methods in multiple dimensions. In terms of LLM-based evaluation and similarity metrics, RaPID outperforms existing baselines on most criteria while remaining competitive on the remaining indicators. The factuality assessment reveals that RaPID achieves significant improvements in F1@300 scores across all foundation models compared to baselines, indicating its superior capability to maintain factual accuracy while preserving high information density. Furthermore, RaPID attains the highest info diversity scores among all tested configurations, suggesting that our method effectively balances information discovery efficiency with diversity preservation. Additionally, we observed that certain simple baseline methods achieved unexpectedly high scores on specific metrics. For instance, RAG exhibits an unusually high relevance score on GPT-4o. This phenomenon may be attributed to the lower information density of its generated content, as evidenced by the fact that the number of claims it produces is less than one-third of that generated by RaPID . This observation underscores the challenge of evaluating long-form content quality using a single metric. In contrast, RaPID demonstrates superior performance across multiple evaluation criteria, reinforcing its robustness and effectiveness.

We assess the resemblance between generated and real outline. The quality evaluation results of outlines are presented in Table 2 . RaPID significantly outperforms other methods across different foundation models, particularly in recall and F1-score metrics. This demonstrates its superior ability to maintain thematic focus while achieving comprehensive coverage of research topics. Notably, although STORM achieves relatively higher recall compared to other baselines, RaPID can efficiently generate higher-quality outlines through retrieval of similar topics, without requiring complex multi-turn agent discussion mechanisms. 5.2 Ablation Studies To evaluate the impact of the writing plan, we conducted an ablation study on GPT-4o by removing the Plan-Guided Article Generation module and instead employing a parallel section-wise generation approach (denoted as \"w/o plan\"). As shown in Table 1 , the absence of a writing plan led to performance degradation across multiple metrics, particularly in organization and factuality. Without contextual paragraph awareness, the model exhibited stylistic inconsistencies and coherence issues between sections, explaining the decline in organization scores. Additionally, generating sections in isolation resulted in redundant content, as each paragraph attempted to cover multiple aspects of the topic independently. While techniques such as STORM can partially mitigate these issues through post hoc refinement, maintaining coherence and quality in long-form text remains challenging due to inherent output length limitations. In contrast, our structured planning approach explicitly defines inter-sectional dependencies, enhancing overall coherence and enabling the generation of longer, more cohesive articles. These findings underscore the critical role of planning in long-form text generation. Backbone Avg. Nodes Avg. Edges Dependency Density Longest Path Qwen-Max 8.72 16.64 2.09 2.79 DeepSeek-v3 7.21 12.18 1.91 2.62 GPT-4o 8.43 11.86 1.55 3.59 Table 3: Results of the graph metrics of Writing Plan. 5.3 Writing Plan Analysis Our method relies on constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sections prior to writing, which defines the contextual dependencies between sections. In this section, we analyze the Writing Plan’s functionality through graph-theoretical metrics. By representing sections as nodes and inter-sectional dependencies as directed edges, we formally define the Writing Plan as a DAG structure G = ( V , E ) 𝐺 𝑉 𝐸 G=(V,E) italic_G = ( italic_V , italic_E ) , where V = { v 1 , v 2 , … , v n } 𝑉 subscript 𝑣 1 subscript 𝑣 2 … subscript 𝑣 𝑛 V=\\{v_{1},v_{2},\\dots,v_{n}\\} italic_V = { italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } denotes the set of n 𝑛 n italic_n nodes (sections), and E ⊆ V × V 𝐸 𝑉 𝑉 E\\subseteq V\\times V italic_E ⊆ italic_V × italic_V represents the directed edges indicating dependencies. To quantify the \"dependency density\" of the Writing Plan, we define it as the ratio of the number of edges to the maximum possible edges in a minimally connected DAG: D ⁢ ( G ) = | E | n − 1 , 𝐷 𝐺 𝐸 𝑛 1 D(G)=\\frac{|E|}{n-1}, italic_D ( italic_G ) = divide start_ARG | italic_E | end_ARG start_ARG italic_n - 1 end_ARG , (7) where | E | 𝐸 |E| | italic_E | is the cardinality of the edge set E 𝐸 E italic_E , and n − 1 𝑛 1 n-1 italic_n - 1 corresponds to the maximum number of edges in a linear chain structure. For example, in a sliding window of length k = 1 𝑘 1 k=1 italic_k = 1 , where each section depends only on its immediate predecessor, the number of edges is | E | = n − 1 𝐸 𝑛 1 |E|=n-1 | italic_E | = italic_n - 1 , yielding a dependency density of D ⁢ ( G ) = 1 𝐷 𝐺 1 D(G)=1 italic_D ( italic_G ) = 1 . Besides dependency density, we also report key metrics to describe the DAG structure: average nodes, edges, and longest path length. The longest path highlights the critical dependency sequence, determining the minimum steps to traverse the Writing Plan. The results for the plans generated by three backbone models are summarized in Table 3 . These results reveal that while the average number of sections across the plans remains relatively consistent, the number of dependencies exhibits more significant variation. Notably, the dependency density for all three backbones exceeds 1, ranging from 1.55 to 2.09. This indicates that the generated plans effectively transcend simple linear structures, capturing more complex long-range dependencies. These findings demonstrate the strong generalization capability of our method. The detailed case study of the writing plan is provided in Appendix E Furthermore, an excessively long critical path can lead to reduced parallelism during section generation, thereby decreasing efficiency. However, the average longest path length of the plans generated by the three backbones does not exceed 4, ensuring that the generation time of RaPID remains within an acceptable range. Further evidence can be found in the detailed efficiency analysis provided in Appendix D . 6 Human Evaluation To gain deeper insights into the quality of the generated articles, we recruited master-degree level 10 volunteers to conduct a human evaluation. We randomly selected 20 topics and requested the volunteers to evaluate articles generated by both RaPID and STORM for each topic. Each article was assigned to two different volunteers to ensure a balanced and unbiased assessment. We provided the volunteers with the same evaluation criteria as those used in the LLM-based assessment (see Table 6 ), which assess four dimensions: Interest Level, Organization, Relevance, and Coverage. Volunteers rated each dimension on a scale from 1 to 5. Additionally, they were asked to indicate their preference for each pair of articles. To mitigate potential bias, the order of methods in each article pair was randomized. Method Intere. Organiz. Relev. Cover. #Prefer STORM 4.01 3.80 3.75 4.05 13 RaPID 3.96 4.03 4.25 4.15 27 Table 4: Results of human evaluation. We had human evaluators evaluate the articles across four dimensions using a fine-grained scale ranging from 1 to 5, and we documented their preferences accordingly. As shown in Table 3, our RaPID significantly outperforms STORM in terms of Organization, Relevance, and Coverage. Additionally, it achieves a notable improvement in overall preference, despite showing a slight disadvantage in Interest. These results indicate that RaPID generates articles of higher overall quality compared to STORM. Notably, the significantly lower Relevance score of STORM may be attributed to hallucination propagation caused by its agent-based discussion mechanism. For example, feedback from volunteers revealed that when processing the topic Vultures 1 (album), STORM’s pre-writing phase—relying solely on LLM-driven dialogue for information collection—misinterpreted the task, mistakenly assuming it involved generating content about vultures (the animal). This misunderstanding led to irrelevant, animal-related perspectives, rendering the entire information collection and writing process ineffective. In contrast, RaPID addresses this issue by employing retrieval-based methods to ensure accurate intent recognition from the outset. This approach enables a more precise and efficient information collection process, significantly reducing the risk of misinterpretation and ultimately improving the quality of the generated content. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we addressed the challenge of knowledge-intensive long-text generation, with a particular focus on encyclopedia-style article generation. We introduced RaPID , an efficient and effective retrieval-augmented writing system that integrates a structured writing plan and information discovery mechanisms. Our extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, our model maintains scalability for other knowledge-intensive long-text writing tasks. In the future, we plan to explore the potential of LLMs in other domain-specific writing tasks, such as financial reports. 8 Limitations Our proposed RaPID , while demonstrating efficacy in long-form Wikipedia article generation, is subject to two key constraints that warrant discussion. The current methodology exclusively focuses on textual content generation, overlooking the critical integration of multimodal elements such as images and tabular data that significantly enhance article credibility and reader engagement in authentic Wikipedia entries. Furthermore, the evaluation framework remains confined to the Wikipedia domain, leaving untested the method’s adaptability to other long-form generation scenarios like financial reporting or academic writing, which demand distinct structural precision and factual rigor. These limitations underscore the need for subsequent research to expand multimodal integration capabilities and conduct cross-domain validation, thereby enhancing both the practical utility and generalizability of the proposed RaPID . 9 Ethics Statement Our research focuses on automated long-text generation using LLMs, specifically for producing Wikipedia-style articles. While this technology holds great potential for enhancing knowledge accessibility and streamlining content creation, it also presents several ethical challenges that we acknowledge and actively address. One key concern is that the generated content may delve into sensitive topics, as the model synthesizes information from diverse sources. Despite our extensive efforts to exclude controversial subjects during dataset construction, there remains a risk of producing biased, misleading, or inappropriate content. Such outputs could inadvertently activate LLM content safety mechanisms. We take this issue seriously and underscore the importance of advancing content filtering techniques and bias mitigation strategies to ensure the responsible use of this technology. Another significant challenge lies in ensuring factual accuracy. Despite implementing measures to minimize errors, the model may still generate incorrect or hallucinated information. Worse still, if misused, this technology could actively contribute to the spread of false information, amplifying its potential societal impact. Addressing this issue calls for future research aimed at enhancing factual consistency, developing safeguards against misuse, and integrating more robust verification systems to validate the generated content.

RecurrentGPT: Interactive Generation of (Arbitrarily) Long Text . arXiv preprint . ArXiv:2305.13304 [cs]. Appendix A Dataset Details Figure 3: The distribution of the length of FreshWiki-2024 We adopted the data collection methodology outlined in FreshWiki to construct our dataset. Specifically, we systematically crawled the top 100 most frequently edited topics monthly from January to December 2024, retaining only articles rated as Class B or higher by the ORES quality assessment system 7 7 7 https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES . To streamline processing and focus our analysis, we removed all tabular data and multimodal content, preserving only plain text following the same approach as STORM. From this curated collection, we randomly selected 100 topics for model evaluation. As shown in Figure 3 , article lengths followed a bimodal distribution: approximately 70% of articles ranged between 2,000 and 8,000 tokens, while we intentionally retained articles exceeding 15,000 tokens to evaluate the model’s performance or processing intricate topic matter. To ensure thematic diversity, we categorized the 100 selected topics into four distinct domains using GPT-4o. Figure 4 illustrates the resulting category distribution, demonstrating broad coverage and relatively balanced representation across various subject areas. Figure 4: The distribution of classification of Freshwiki-2024 Appendix B Evaluation Details B.1 Limitations for NER-based outline evaluation methods STORM’s NER-based evaluation metrics, namely Entity Recall and Soft Entity Recall, exhibit two fundamental limitations. First, conventional NER models are not specifically designed for outline evaluation. In particular, key section titles (e.g., \"Background\") in outlines often do not correspond to well-defined named entities. As a result, extracting entities from golden outlines can be unreliable, and in extreme cases, no identifiable entities may be present at all. Second, the soft entity recall metric suffers from abnormal scaling behavior due to the lack of a normalization mechanism. This absence of normalization, coupled with the inherent limitations of entity recognition, can lead to inflated scores that misrepresent the actual quality of an outline. B.2 Article Quality Evaluation We utilize the Qwen-Turbo model as the backbone for FactScore, which decomposes atomic facts and assesses their accuracy. FactScore can be regarded as a measure of the factual accuracy of generated text. However, comparing FactScore across different texts can be challenging when the generated content varies significantly in length. To address this issue, we utilize FactAlign, which assumes a predefined number of claims, denoted as K 𝐾 K italic_K , for each article. The recall is then computed as the ratio of generated claims to K 𝐾 K italic_K , allowing for a more balanced evaluation. Based on this, we calculate the F ⁢ 1 ⁢ @ ⁢ K 𝐹 1 @ 𝐾 F1@K italic_F 1 @ italic_K score, where we set K = 300 𝐾 300 K=300 italic_K = 300 in our experiments. Regarding LLM evaluation, we observed that due to the context length limitations of Prometheus-7b-v1.0 , STORM processes all generated articles to a limited length of 2,000 words, which significantly impacts the fairness of the evaluation. Thanks to the extended context length of Prometheus-7b-v2.0 , we were able to process articles up to 10,000 words in our experiments, leading to a more comprehensive assessment. The detailed prompts for LLM Evaluation are shown in Table 6 . Table 5 shows the Pearson correlation coefficient data between human evaluation and LLM evaluation. Additionally, we utilized text-embedding-3-small to generate embeddings for the info diversity metric, following the implementation of CoSTORM.

Table 6: Scoring rubrics for LLM Evaluation Appendix C Full Prompt As discussed in § 2 , we divided our RaPID framework into three modules and listed the prompts used for each. The prompts we use for §§ 3.2 are listed in Figure 6 , 7 while §§ 3.3 in Figure 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and §§ 3.4 in Figure 13 , 14 . Appendix D Efficiency and Usage Analysis RaPID integrates an attribute-constrained information-seeking module, which is designed to enhance efficiency while maintaining comprehensiveness. To evaluate its efficiency and usability compared to other baselines, we collected the average time and API usage for generating 100 topics. For methods involving parallel section generation, we set the maximum parallelism to 3. As shown in the table, although the first three simple baselines consume less time and resources, they struggle to generate reliable articles. In contrast, RaPID not only produces high-quality articles but also significantly reduces API usage and time consumption compared to STORM and Co-STORM. {tblr} hline1,2,4,6,7 = -0.08em, colspec = lccc & Calls(/it) Tokens(k/it) Time(s/it) RAG 2 6.37 32.12 ORAG 14.25 24.13 109.83 STORM 88.06 60.71 163.22 Co-STORM 70.30 50.52 154.14 RaPID 31.04 43.62 127.19 Table 7: Results of pipeline efficiency evaluation. We evaluated the average API calls, token consumption, and the total duration time of generating an article. Additionally, we analyzed the proportion of time consumed at each stage by STORM, Co-STORM, and RaPID , as illustrated in Figure 5 . The results indicate that both STORM and Co-STORM predominantly allocate a substantial amount of time to the pre-writing stage, leading to significant time consumption. This is largely due to their reliance on an agent-based dialogue mechanism during the pre-writing phase, which is inherently difficult to optimize further. In contrast, RaPID drastically reduces the time spent in the pre-writing stage through its parallelized information collection approach, enabling more efficient resource allocation across all stages. Figure 5: The distribution of time consumed in each stage of the pipelines. Appendix E Case Study We utilized RaPID to generate an article on the topic of AlphaFold. The complete outline and writing plan are illustrated in Figures 15 and 16 , respectively. Due to space limitations, only a small portion of the final generated article is presented in Figure 17 . This case demonstrates that RaPID is capable of effectively generating a coherent writing plan and producing a comprehensive and consistent long-form article.

Each section is a dependency for the sections listed as its values; \"None\" indicates that the section does not serve as a dependency for any other section. AlphaFold # Development ## Origin of the Project The development of AlphaFold emerged from a long-standing challenge in the field of structural biology: accurately predicting protein structures based on amino acid sequences, a problem often referred to as the \"protein-folding problem.\" This issue had persisted as one of the most significant puzzles in biology for over five decades, with limited progress despite numerous scientific efforts[2]. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., initiated the AlphaFold project with the goal of leveraging advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, to address this challenge. The project culminated in the release of AlphaFold 2 in 2020, a system that achieved near-experimental accuracy in many cases and fundamentally reshaped the landscape of protein structure prediction[3]. ## Collaboration with Scientific Communities The development and adoption of AlphaFold have been significantly bolstered by its integration with and support from scientific communities. Following its launch, AlphaFold quickly became a focal point of discussion and collaboration within the structural biology field. For instance, researchers like Pedro Beltrao from ETH and EMBL-EBI initiated joint studies based on results shared on social media platforms, turning the excitement surrounding AlphaFold into a collective research effort. This bottom-up approach exemplified the enthusiasm and openness fostered by AlphaFold’s innovations, allowing scientists from various institutions to collaborate and build upon shared findings[4]. Moreover, AlphaFold embraced the principles of open science by releasing its predictions and source code, alongside the establishment of an open-access protein structure database containing over 200 million protein structures. This democratized access to cutting-edge resources and enabled researchers globally to integrate AlphaFold’s predictions into their work, regardless of institutional funding or geographic location. By adhering to transparency, accessibility, and collaboration, AlphaFold not only advanced the field of protein structure prediction but also inspired open science initiatives in other disciplines[2]. # Algorithm ## AlphaFold 1 The first iteration of AlphaFold debuted in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP13) competition, marking a significant milestone in protein structure prediction. While AlphaFold 1 relied on traditional homology modeling approaches combined with deep learning techniques, its ability to predict protein structures with reasonable accuracy laid the groundwork for future advancements. This version introduced key innovations in handling sequence alignments and template-based predictions, setting the stage for subsequent breakthroughs[5]. ## AlphaFold 2 AlphaFold 2 represented a transformative leap in protein structure prediction. Unveiled during CASP14, it utilized a completely redesigned architecture to achieve near-experimental accuracy in many cases. Unlike its predecessor, AlphaFold 2 did not rely solely on homology modeling or templates but could predict structures for previously unknown protein folds[6][5]. The model introduced innovations such as the incorporation of attention mechanisms and pairwise geometric features, enabling it to accurately model spatial relationships between amino acids. These advances allowed AlphaFold 2 to excel at decoupling the training and inference tasks, a unique approach that optimized the system for both learning from data and making predictions[7][6].
