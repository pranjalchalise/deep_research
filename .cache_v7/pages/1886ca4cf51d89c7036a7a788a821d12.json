This means you can use your preferred validation library without lock-in: Copy import { z } from \"zod\" ; // or valibot, arktype, etc. import { StateSchema , ReducedValue , MessagesValue } from \"@langchain/langgraph\" ; const AgentState = new StateSchema ({ messages: MessagesValue , currentStep: z . string (), count: z . number (). default ( 0 ), history: new ReducedValue ( z . array ( z . string ()). default (() => []), { inputSchema: z . string (), reducer : ( current , next ) => [ ... current , next ], } ), }); // Type-safe state and update types type State = typeof AgentState . State ; type Update = typeof AgentState . Update ; const graph = new StateGraph ( AgentState ) . addNode ( \"agent\" , ( state ) => ({ count: state . count + 1 })) . addEdge ( START , \"agent\" ) . addEdge ( \"agent\" , END ) . compile (); ​ New state value primitives ReducedValue : Define fields with custom reducers for accumulating values. Supports separate input and output schemas for type-safe reducer inputs. UntrackedValue : Define transient state that exists during execution but is never checkpointed - useful for database connections, caches, or runtime-only configuration. MessagesValue : A prebuilt ReducedValue for chat messages with the standard messages reducer. ​ Type helper exports New exported type utilities for typing functions outside the graph builder: GraphNode<Schema, Nodes?, Config?> - Type node functions with full inference ConditionalEdgeRouter<Schema, Nodes?> - Type conditional edge routers Copy // Type standalone node functions const myNode : GraphNode < typeof AgentState > = ( state , config ) => { return { count: state . count + 1 }; }; // Use schema type helpers directly const processState = ( state : typeof AgentState . State ) => { console . log ( state . count ); }; The existing Annotation and zod-based API continues to work unchanged - StateSchema is an additional option for those who prefer schema-first definitions. Learn more about StateSchema See the full documentation for defining graph state with StateSchema, ReducedValue, and UntrackedValue. Learn about type utilities Use GraphNode and ConditionalEdgeRouter to type functions outside the graph builder. ​ Dec 12, 2025 ​ v1.2.0 ​ langchain Structured output : Added ability to manually set strict mode when using providerStrategy for structured output. ​ @langchain/openai New provider built-in tools: Support for file search , web search , code interpreter , image generation , computer use , shell , and MCP connector tools. Content moderation: New moderateContent option on ChatOpenAI for detecting and handling unsafe content. Prefer responses API for GPT-5.2 Pro model. ​ v1.3.0 ​ @langchain/anthropic New provider built-in tools: Support for text editor , web fetch , computer use , tool search , and MCP toolset tools. Exposed ChatAnthropicInput type for improved type safety. ​ v1.1.0 ​ @langchain/ollama Native structured outputs: Added support for native structured output via withStructuredOutput . Support for custom baseUrl configuration. ​ v1.0.0 ​ @langchain/community Jira document loader updated to use v3 API. LanceDB: Added similaritySearch() and similaritySearchWithScore() support. Elasticsearch hybrid search support. New GoogleCalendarDeleteTool . Various bug fixes for LlamaCppEmbeddings, PrismaVectorStore, IBM WatsonX, and security improvements. ​ Other packages @langchain/xai: Native Live Search support. @langchain/tavily: Added Tavily’s research endpoint. @langchain/mongodb: New MongoDB LLM cache. @langchain/mcp-adapters: Added onConnectionError option. @langchain/google-common: jsonSchema method support in withStructuredOutput . @langchain/core: Security fixes, better subgraph nesting in Mermaid graphs, UUID7 for run IDs. ​ Nov 25, 2025 ​ v1.1.0 Model profiles : Chat models now expose supported features and capabilities through a .profile getter. These data are derived from models.dev , an open source project providing model capability data. Model retry middleware : New middleware for automatically retrying failed model calls with configurable exponential backoff, improving agent reliability. Content moderation middleware : OpenAI content moderation middleware for detecting and handling unsafe content in agent interactions. Supports checking user input, model output, and tool results. Summarization middleware : Updated to support flexible trigger points using model profiles for context-aware summarization. Structured output : ProviderStrategy support (native structured output) can now be inferred from model profiles. SystemMessage for createAgent : Support for passing SystemMessage instances directly to createAgent ’s systemPrompt parameter and a new concat method for extending system messages. Enables advanced features like cache control and structured content blocks. Dynamic system prompt middleware : Return values from dynamicSystemPromptMiddleware are now purely additive. When returning a SystemMessage or string , they are merged with existing system messages rather than replacing them, making it easier to compose multiple middleware that modify the prompt. Compatibility improvements: Fixed error handling for Zod v4 validation errors in structured output and tool schemas, ensuring detailed error messages are properly displayed. ​ Oct 20, 2025 ​ v1.0.0 ​ langchain Release notes Migration guide ​ langgraph Release notes Migration guide If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please open an issue so we can improve.
