Technologies: Machine learning, Python, Tensorflow/Keras/pytorch, spark, Scala, AWS, kafka, HDFS, etc. A whole host of technologies over 20 year career. email in profile. I'm an experienced Data scientist, who's worked on a bunch of interesting projects. With Covid I've come to realize I need to work in public more often. So an ideal fit would be a small/medium company with hair on fire problems that need solving that I can talk about publicly. What sort of problems do I like? A Taxi company in latam hired me to built a fleet maintenance system. It predicted and scheduled preventative maintenance to reduce wear and tear and avoid breakdowns. We also identified the leading cause of wear - leadfoot drivers. So we built a system that would identify aggressive driving. Another example was a speculative sports highlights annotation system I built with a consultancy. It ingested sports video and identified predetermined highlights in baseball - diving catches in our case. The ML pipeline was a CNN model which fed into an RNN. Given a bunch of video clips of diving catches as training data, it could later identify those diving catches and automatically annotate the video feeds. Who shouldn't contact me. If your market is Ads or gambling I'm not interested. Sure there's lot of money, but I'd rather sleep at night.

Everyone here is some kind of developer! And remember what developers are notoriosly bad at? That's right -- marketing and sales...which is exactly what I can help you with. Because no matter how good your product is if you don't know who your audience is and how to market it to them. Remember what Gary Halbert said to his students if they were to compete with his hypothetical hot-dog stand, \"I'll give you every advantage you ask for -- better hot-dogs, better prices, whatever...as long as I can get only one advantage. I want a starving crowd!\" Every week I stumble upon websites of software companies who are just as good as their more famous competitors (or even better), but their marketing sucks, and that's why they never reach the hockey-stick growth phase. Want some help with that? Send me an email today. Cheers, Filip Stanojevic -- Copywriter & Marketer P. S. Don't worry about sleazy sales tactics, I am an engineer by training myself -- I did a lot of coding and data analytics while earning my BSc in engineering. ashton314 on April 1, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: Salt Lake City, Utah, US Remote: Yes; happy to work in-person too Willing to relocate: No Technologies: I've written non-trivial programs in more languages than I am years old.

Prior to starting graduate school I worked as a full-time developer writing Elixir for Spiff. During my time at Spiff, I made it possible to use Spiff's commission calculation feature from inside Salesforce's interface. Two years later, Spiff got acquired by Salesforce. Coincidence?… probably not. I am looking for full-time or part-time work during the summer months. (I can't work during the semester: school + research + family = enough for me to worry about.) I've worked successfully as a summer intern at multiple companies (TazWorks, Spiff specifically; worked at other startups as well). howard941 on April 1, 2024 | prev | next [–] Embedded Firmware Engineer Location: Sarasota Remote: Preferred Willing to relocate: No thank you Technologies: C; Sensors; Communications; Drone/UAV/robotics: New product development; Sustainment; Embedded/firmware/bare metal, FreeRTOS, NuttX; *nix/RF/crypto; Kinetis KE Cortex M0+ & M4, Nordic Semi's M4 SOC, ST's M4 ARMs, Espressif's ESP8266, Microchip dsPIC; realtime; IAR, gcc via MCUXpresso & Kinetis Dev and TrueStudio & unix like systems; MPLAB-X IDE; Embedded FreeBSD; Embedded Linux on for ex.

By starting from the bottom and working my way up to a Senior Director level position, I have been able to get a unique view of how a company functions while being part of the decisions and mistakes a company makes as it goes from being on the brink of bankruptcy to growth on a global scale. My initiatives to continuously automate as much work as possible, re-evaluate working processes, and improve redundant systems allowed the company to grow at an exponential rate while not increasing headcount. The extra capital this saved us allowed us to easily handle industry-wide downturns without having to cut any of the workforce or pull back on any projects or goals. I am fluent in Python 3+ and don't have much desire to write anything else at this point. Areas that currently interest me are * Climate Change, Climate Tech * Agriculture, AgTech * Automotive * Robotocs (MicroPython) * Solar * General Charity or 501(c)(3) * Research Lab * National security but I'm open for anything interesting. As far as hobbies go, I enjoy woodworking with hand tools, mowing the lawn, and watching whatever the Criterion Channel suggests. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to follow-up. I am always glad to chat!

I have been getting wonderful offers from great companies but am still on the job market because I suffer from an unfortunate health condition that makes my sleep rather erratic. My working efficiency is still exceptional, energy levels are great, and my output is the best it’s ever been, but I sometimes start work as late as 11am pst which is unacceptable for most companies. Anyways, if this won’t be a problem for your team I’m happy to hear from you. I’ll be happy to make accommodations for you if you’re willing to make this one for me. I'm excited to hear from you! :) tplick on April 4, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: Philadelphia, PA Remote: Yes Willing to relocate: Yes Technologies: a lot, but mostly Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, GCP Résumé: https://www.amecy.com/work/Plick_resume_web_2023-10.pdf Email: tomplick AT gmail.com For the most part, my résumé only has my professional experience on it. To see more of what I've done, please visit my work summary at https://www.amecy.com/work/ . In particular, if you play chess, check out my chess training site at https://www.checkmatechamp.net/ . That site runs on the Google Cloud Platform and uses Python on the backend. The frontend is a mix of vanilla JS and OCaml (using js_of_ocaml). My experience at startups has helped me learn how to build systems, and how to keep them running, simply and with minimal resources. (For example, as of this writing, Checkmate Champ has been running for 601 days without my intervention.) I have learned a lot of languages over the years that I never got the chance to use in a professional setting, including Lisp, OCaml, Haskell, and Smalltalk. If you are using one of these, I would love to hear about it. halvardm on April 5, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: Berlin, Germany Remote: Yes (EU only) Willing to relocate: No Technologies: - Development: React, TypeScript, Node, Deno, Go, Rust - Database: SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite - Cloud/Devops: AWS, GCP, CI/CD, CDK, Terraform, Docker, Jenkins - Also experience with (prefer not to work with except for refactoring legacy into TS/Go/Rust): PHP, Java & Python, tapped into Assembly (x86) Résumé/CV: https://morstad.eu (CV on request) Email: jobs@morstad.eu Hi!

You have developers that have trained extensively to talk to computers often in multiple languages. And it is hard enough to write documentation for other developers. Asking them to create documentation talking to users, system administrators, DevOps and management are even more dialects because they speak in their own jargon, and it costs a lot of their very expensive time. I know technology, hardware, software, firmware and more. In tech, medical, aerospace, automotive and IT industries. I can do the translating for developers so they can concentrate on making the hard stuff. I also know user experience (UX) I can guide you to make better user interfaces and keep you from making those mistakes that cripple many products. vikbez on April 2, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: France Remote: Yes, but I can be in Paris 1d/week Willing to relocate: No Technologies: Python, Ruby, C, GCP, Docker, Linux, PSQL, K8S, hardware (not exhaustive, I am happy to learn more) Résumé/CV: https://vik.tf/cv.pdf Email: mromaingay(at)gmail.com Senior SRE / Fullstack / Maker & Hardware hacker 2013-2018: Founding engineer of Scaleway For the last 3 years I have been working at a self-sustained startup as a DevOps/SRE focusing on global performance improvements, reducing cloud budgets, enhancing architecture, bootstrapping the platform to China in compliance with RGPD and PIPL, security fixes, added CICD pipelines, added K8S, SSO SAML Auth and various other interesting tasks.

Definitely not a math major, but I do understand the practical use and intentions of model layers, matrix multiplications, and other various inner processes of neural networks. I am currently working on a project that produces AST parses of one of my projects (20k+ loc), turns them into embeddings, and trains a model to answer questions and help me continue to code that project.

You see, I have vast experience in technical writing, technical support, and sales – from hungry startups looking to change the game to companies as big and established as Apple looking to endlessly craft perfection. I want to join your team’s technical writing and editing team. I can take your technical writing, and I can take it higher. I have a lofty understanding of Apple’s core values precisely because defense and cybersecurity runs in my family. My father worked for Boeing as an Aerospace engineer for almost 20+ years and his lessons and values are deeply instilled in me – and that shows up in my work, too. I’m not just any kind of writer, either: I am a technical writer with an A.S. in Computer Science, a B.A. in Philosophy (and Pre-Med to boot) and I’m also published. This all to say that I have the experience and the aptitude to communicate technically; I received a perfect score on the SAT Writing/Essay examination (an “8” which places me in the 98th – 99th percentile of test takers in the good old US of A). I am looking forward to professionally articulating and artfully transforming your company’s values into analytical, intrepid and pertinent technical writing — with a good eye for proofreading, editing and beyond.

I spent the last 5 years as the founding member and CTO of a startup, which still thrives under the leadership of my two co-founders. There I architected, designed and developed a procurement software for custom made packaging that convinced customers with industry revolutionizing features and excellent UX using Angular, Java and PostgreSQL. I also applied state-of-the-art optimization and machine learning algorithms to industry specific tasks. One example is a packaging size optimization service that I created, which saves Germany's leading e-commerce websites (e.g. Flaconi) 10 - 15% of packaging and shipping costs every day. Before that I worked as a data engineer at a global mobile advertisement company. I worked on extremely high traffic systems with hundreds of servers, where the limiting factor was the number of requests, which required us to switch to an asynchronous architecture by migrating our application to Vert.x, which reduced the number of required computing resources by over 60%. I also delivered on a data pipeline redesign, where we reduced data storage requirements by 80% through efficient sampling, which saved tens of thousand of dollars every month.

I'm a Senior Multidisciplinary Designer and Marketing Specialist where much of my work is in creating branded assets for web, social, email, ads, tradeshows, print media and more - mostly in the form of graphic design, video editing, animations, advertising, and managing several visual identities. The types of assets I create are collateral, presentations, documentation (guides, whitepapers, etc), videos, animations, and ads in both 2D and 3D. I have used HubSpot for marketing campaigns, but my primary role is almost entirely creative, however, I can create custom CSS classes and have a background in landing page design (HTML/CSS/JS). My tools of choice are within the Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro, and After Effects), however I also frequently use Blender and DaVinci Studio when those tools are a better fit for a project. I'm also familiar with Canva, however, Illustrator and Photoshop are more granular and outperform Canva in terms of creating content. If you'd like to see some of my work, you can visit my website at https://chrisgallon.com , and if you think I can be an asset to your team, feel free to reach out to me by email at ckgallon@gmail.com.

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals. Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else. Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty. I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers. I'd love to chat and network about opportunities; if you think you have a product that could benefit from my skill set, drop me a line! alexzhues on April 1, 2024 | prev | next [–] Alexander Huesing - Data Analyst/Scientist (Retail analytics) Location: Bentonville, AR Remote: Preferred Willing to Relocate: No Technologies: SQL (Presto/Trino), Python Resume/CV: www.hues.ing Email: alex@hues.ing 5 years at Walmart in business operations (buyer/merchant) and then Pricing Strategy.

Through my career, I’ve leveraged my business experience & communication skills to place myself in more technical roles that align with my passion for learning about technology. I’m a good fit for a PM or data role in retail or supply chain, and willing to take a step back into a more junior position that brings me closer to engineering. wonger_ on April 2, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: Florida, USA Remote: Yes Willing to relocate: No Technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, Elm, Svelte, Rust, Bash, WebGL, Git Résumé/CV: wonger.dev/assets/wong-resume.pdf Email: justin@wonger.dev Website: wonger.dev GitHub: github.com/wong-justin Availability: Part-time I am a full-stack developer focused on improving user experience.

I am Shashank, a data, cloud and backend engineer with 8 years of experience. Currently, I am working at an Ad Tech security company where I specialise in building backend APIs, ETL pipelines, working on security tools, overhauling our architecture and deployment processes, and managing a small team on the enterprise vertical. Prior to this, I was a founding engineer and data engineer at a DeFI based music startup, where I single-handedly built the entire backend & data infrastructure, frontend dashboards, analytics and reporting system and most of the company's products. I also built the entire payments platform that empowered music artists by using Stripe Treasury to land actual USD payments in their bank accounts and led the engineering team to success. Throughout my 8-year career, I have gained extensive experience in delivering products from concept to launch, designing architecture, product & infrastructure planning, and managing small teams. I have been working fully remotely for New York based companies since the past 5 years from India and Europe(as a digital nomad). I am open to fully remote roles as well as onsite/hybrid if visa sponsorship is available. irvingprime on April 2, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: New York State (up by Lake Ontario) Remote: Only Willing to Relocate: No Technologies: Ruby, Python, Redis, Mysql, Postgres, Mongo, and many more.

With over six years of experience in applied machine learning, I worked mainly on pipelining machine learning models for search retrieval/ranking (text/image/multimodal), recommender systems, including computer vision tasks (object detection, segmentation) mainly from ECCV/CVPR/NeurIPS competitions on Kaggle, and financial AI use-cases (scenario generation of stock portfolios, fraud detection at scale such as multi-chain Blockchains transactions > 100M). I am amenable to acquiring proficiency in diverse programming languages/frameworks, and infrastructure (currently learning Rust). My problem-solving aptitude extends beyond coding and product development; I actively seek opportunities to enhance the development process and assist colleagues through mentoring and coaching. If your team requires a machine learning researcher/engineer, data scientist, or research scientist to build production-grade modelling pipeline focussed toward performance optimisation and producing high-quality code and features, I am readily available for a full-time, remote/contract, and long-term roles. fouc on April 1, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: Vancouver / Victoria Remote: Yes Willing to relocate: Yes Technologies: Elixir, Phoenix, Tailwindcss, Postgres, MySQL, JavaScript Résumé/CV: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-robey/22/b0a/152 Email: james.robey@gmail.com chad_strategic on April 2, 2024 | prev | next [–] SEEKING WORK | Location: Denver | Remote Sr. Full Stack Developer / Software Engineer Manager Languages: PHP, Frameworks = Laravel/Vue.js MySql Resume: https://www.strategic-options.com/chads_resume.html Email: mr(.)chad(.)humphrey@gmail.com paolaguitian on April 15, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: South Florida, USA Remote: Yes Willing to relocate: Yes Technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Next.js, Angular, Node.js, GraphQL Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paola-guitian/ Email: poliguitian@gmail.com cpn_nixel549 on April 1, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: Warsaw, Poland Remote: Yes or Hybrid Willing to relocate: Yes Ability to change stack: Yes Technologies: C#, JS, React, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, MS SQL, Cosmos DB Methodologies: Agile, Scrum, SDLC Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/capnnixel/ Commercial experience: 3+ years. xialvjun on April 2, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: Wuhan, China Remote: Yes Willing to relocate: Yes Technologies: Vue, ReactJS, NodeJS Resume/CV: https://github.com/xialvjun/xialvjun.github.io Email: xialvjun@gmail.com rhifun on April 1, 2024 | prev | next [–] Location: Denver, CO Remote: Yes Willing to relocate: Yes Technologies: Python, Django, C++, C, Java, PostgreSQL Résumé/CV: https://shorturl.at/hlEX8 Email: max.hampton@gmail.com New college grad looking for opportunities near Denver, CO and Dallas, TX, although I am open to other locations as well.

I am a senior data scientist / MLops (9+ years) who specializes in computer vision in production and R&D. I have a Ph.D. in neuroscience and machine learning with more 6 papers in international journals. Sadly, I got laid off last month by DVC (iterative.ai) and am looking for a new job opportunity. I'm passionate about everything I'm working on and willing to go the extra mile to be truly happy with the result (code or performance-wise). In the last two years, I launched and managed an R&D team, co-led a team of six data scientists, and filed two patents. In addition to everything you might expect from a data scientist working with deep learning, here is what I bring to the table: - experienced and team-oriented: I built and maintained two MLops pipelines, from dataset creation to model serving. My team used them to train and deploy models for more than 50 real-time vision tasks. I do my best to ensure that my team is efficient and smiling. - tech knowledge and good communication skills: I follow and contribute to open-source, and I am familiar with many topics (self-host, cloud, database, web dev, design, etc...). I help people from different teams communicate to understand each other's needs. I do my best to ensure my colleagues communicate well and smile. - cost savings and revenue generation: I created and served software that generated 25,000€ for the company in two weeks. I also built and maintained an on-prem GPU cluster to train models, saving ~20,000€ per year. I do my best so shareholders can smile in their brand-new Tesla. - social events and team gatherings: Even if I work remotely, I love to gather co-workers around events (in real life or remotely). I organized the three last offsites in my previous company. I'm good at communication and always enjoy chatting about work or hobbies. I do my best to organize social gatherings and smile. I would love to work for a startup committed to a humanist cause. I'm also looking at startups that empower women and put them in positions of power and decision-making. I believe this would lead to a better and more inclusive work environment. If you think I'm a great match, feel free to contact me by mail, I am answering within a day.

I know people with similar background who worked in an office. Lying would be saying you went to a school somewhere you didn’t or didn’t work as long as you said so. I think you are making a lot of assumptions from a personal bias. programjames on April 2, 2024 | root | parent | next [–] I too know people with similar background who worked on app development on said \"missions\". However, (1) The vast majority of missionaries for @ashton314's church spend the vast majority of their time proselyting. (2) The inclusion of \"training to other volunteers\" and exclusion of more unique experiences implies @ashton314 falls in this majority. I agree that I assumed this applied to @ashton314, but it's not like that was a large leap of faith. whiterknight on April 2, 2024 | root | parent | next [–] You just called him a liar based on that “leap”. I still fail to see the issue if it’s a minority of activity. Does your resume description perfectly correlate to percentage of time spent? programjames on April 2, 2024 | root | parent | next [–] The issue of misrepresentation is not a minority of activity, as I explicitly pointed out in my comment (\"30–40% ...\"). And yes, my resume does. I do not owe you to prove this, but I will. Here are some snippets from my resume: \"Strong math, CS, & ML backgrounds (graduate-level), physics and chemistry are so-so, and biology is weak.\" \"Worked one summer on [redacted] at [redacted], and another summer at [redacted] updating Python2 code to Python3.\" I'm not putting the rest because (1) I prefer pseudonymity, (2) \"trade\" secrets. whiterknight on April 2, 2024 | root | parent | next [–] I don’t think you understand the question. Eg. a large part of my day is going to meetings, but I’m not obligated to make that the focus of my resume. I have a feeling this is going nowhere. Let’s think twice before attacking strangers in hiring posts please. ashton314 on April 2, 2024 | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I know people with similar background who worked in an office This is true: a lot of people called on \"missions\" from my faith spend their entire time doing volunteer work in an office, at a food bank, as a tour guide at historical sites, or as a musical performer. ashton314 on April 1, 2024 | parent | prev | next [–] Everything on my résumé is true, and I'm not trying to misrepresent who I am or what I did. I'm trying to emphasize the aspects of my time as a missionary that would be relevant to a potential employer. Moreover, \"missionary\" might mean different things to different people, so I selected terms that would more neutrally convey what I did. Note that on my blog (where I have more space; linked on my résumé) I go into greater detail about my time as a missionary. No employer (should) care that I was a missionary—but they would be interested in the community service I rendered and the skills I learned in leadership positions. Hence, I emphasize what is relevant in this context. That you say you find this \"extremely disingenuous\" makes me think that you would be off-put by service as a missionary and are annoyed that I am supposedly somehow trying to obscure that fact. Are you trying to be hostile? Your tone is definitely aggressive and you're making a lot of assumptions. programjames on April 2, 2024 | root | parent | next [–] > No employer (should) care that I was a missionary This is a two-fold motte-and-bailey defense. Legally employers should not care. I can imagine a gay, anti-theist very much would, whether or not they can do anything about it legally. Second, you are claiming more than \"I was a missionary\". As you said, \"missionary\" might mean different things to different people, so what you put in your resume greatly affects how people interpret the word. And your implied definition is far different than what you actually did. For example, someone could say, \"I play an integral part in the fiduciary responsibilities necessary to run a multi-billion dollar franchise,\" but it's much more honest to say, \"I work the till at McDonald's.\" I don't think yours is nearly so egregious, but I find it difficult to believe you are not trying to misrepresent who you are. As I mentioned in the parent comment, almost everyone misrepresents themselves on applications, or even outright lies! I don't, and so it's really frustrating to see the signalling game break down like this. hugh-avherald on April 2, 2024 | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's not disingenuous, don't worry. Even if there were some reason that proselyting was a juncture for some employment decision (hard to see how there would be, legally, but hypothetically), they could ask you to simply elaborate on that role at an interview. programjames on April 2, 2024 | root | parent | next [–] I mean, my point was kind of that they didn't mention the word \"proselyting\" at all. If that's what you're doing for the majority of your time, it feels like a lie of omission to not even mention it . It'd be like putting: \"B.S. in Computer Science (2013–2017); attended classes at MIT; 4.0 GPA\" when the reality is I went to Wellesley and cross-enrolled in a couple architecture classes. I entirely understand only selecting information that's relevant to the job. I think it's disingenuous to only select information that's relevant to the job and puts you in the best light . It's even worse if that implies you have more experience in a relevant area than you actually do. Yes, people can ask you to elaborate at an interview. But that wastes their time, and makes it so people who actually have the experience you claimed might not fit in the interviewer's schedule.
