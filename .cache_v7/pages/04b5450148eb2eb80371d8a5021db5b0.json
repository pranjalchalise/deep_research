Publications (10) Exchange controlled triplet fusion in metal–organic frameworks Article Full-text available October 2022 · 295 Reads · 52 Citations Nature Materials Dong-Gwang Ha · Ruomeng Wan · Changhae Andrew Kim · [...] · Mircea Dincă Triplet-fusion-based photon upconversion holds promise for a wide range of applications, from photovoltaics to bioimaging. The efficiency of triplet fusion, however, is fundamentally limited in conventional molecular and polymeric systems by its spin dependence. Here, we show that the inherent tailorability of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), combined with their highly porous but ordered structure, minimizes intertriplet exchange coupling and engineers effective spin mixing between singlet and quintet triplet–triplet pair states. We demonstrate singlet–quintet coupling in a pyrene-based MOF, NU-1000. An anomalous magnetic field effect is observed from NU-1000 corresponding to an induced resonance between singlet and quintet states that yields an increased fusion rate at room temperature under a relatively low applied magnetic field of 0.14 T. Our results suggest that MOFs offer particular promise for engineering the spin dynamics of multiexcitonic processes and improving their upconversion performance. Triplet-fusion-based photon upconversion is promising for photovoltaic or bioimaging applications, but its efficiency is limited by triplet fusion spin dependence. Here, the authors tailor spin dynamics by engineering the crystal structure with metal–organic frameworks to enable effective spin mixing between singlet and quintet triplet–triplet pair states.

This is particularly challenging for solid-state systems, where the chromophores are fixed in close proximity. For instance, the low efficiency of solid-state triplet-triplet upconversion calls for inhibiting the parasitic singlet back-transfer without blocking the flow of triplet excitons. Here, we present a reticular chemistry strategy that inhibits the resonance energy transfer of singlet excitons. Within a pillared layer metal-organic framework (MOF), pyrene-based singlet donors are situated perpendicular to porphyrin-based acceptors. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction enable direct visualization of the structural relationship between donor and acceptor (D-A) chromophores within the MOF. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that the structural and symmetry features of the MOF reduce the donor-to-acceptor singlet transfer efficiency to less than 36% compared to around 96% in the control sample, where the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor chromophores cannot be controlled.

Baldo Two-dimensional (2D) π-conjugated metal–organic frameworks (πMOFs) are a new class of designer electronic materials that are porous and tunable through the constituent organic molecules and choice of metal ions. Unlike typical MOFs, 2D πMOFs exhibit high conductivity mediated by delocalized π-electrons and have promising applications in a range of electrical devices as well as exotic physical properties. Here, we develop a growth method that generates single-crystal plates with lateral dimensions exceeding 10 μm, orders of magnitude bigger than previous methods. Synthesis of large single crystals eliminates a significant impediment to the fundamental characterization of the materials, allowing determination of the intrinsic conductivity and mobility along the 2D plane of πMOFs. A representative 2D πMOF, Ni-CAT-1, exhibits a conductivity of up to 2 S/cm, and Hall measurement reveals the origin of the high conductivity. Characterization of crystalline 2D πMOFs creates the foundation for developing electronic applications of this promising and highly diverse class of materials.

Fusella · [...] · Marc A. Baldo Organic light‐emitting devices (OLEDs) are widely used for mobile displays, but the relatively short lifetime of blue OLEDs remains a challenge in many applications. Typically, instability is viewed as a material‐specific chemical degradation problem. It is known to be alleviated by reducing the operating current or otherwise decreasing the exciton density. It is shown here that this view is incomplete. For archetypical phosphorescent materials, it is observed that the dependence of photostability on the triplet exciton lifetime follows a cubic power law, steeper than its dependence on exciton density. It is demonstrated that the triplet exciton lifetime not only determines the energy stored within an OLED, it also determines the loss in luminescence by controlling the yield of quenching by defects. The dominant role of the triplet exciton lifetime suggests that the stability of the best OLED materials can be significantly improved via rapid extraction of the energy stored in triplet excitons.

The structures position the donor and acceptor with cofacial alignment at distances of 3.3-3.5 ? wherein efficient spatial charge transfer can occur. The quantum yields were enhanced by excluding molecular oxygen and thermally activated delayed fluorescence with lifetimes on the order of microseconds was observed. Although the molecules displayed low quantum yields in solution, higher quantum yields were observed in the solid state. Crystal structures revealed ?-? intramolecular interactions between a donor and an acceptor, however, the dominant intermolecular interactions were C-H????, which likely restrict the molecular dynamics to create aggregation-induced enhanced emission. Organic light emitting devices using XPT and XtBuCT as dopants displayed electroluminescence external quantum efficiencies as high as 10%.

Hirzel · [...] · Alán Aspuru-Guzik Virtual screening is becoming a ground-breaking tool for molecular discovery due to the exponential growth of available computer time and constant improvement of simulation and machine learning techniques. We report an integrated organic functional material design process that incorporates theoretical insight, quantum chemistry, cheminformatics, machine learning, industrial expertise, organic synthesis, molecular characterization, device fabrication and optoelectronic testing. After exploring a search space of 1.6 million molecules and screening over 400,000 of them using time-dependent density functional theory, we identified thousands of promising novel organic light-emitting diode molecules across the visible spectrum. Our team collaboratively selected the best candidates from this set. The experimentally determined external quantum efficiencies for these synthesized candidates were as large as 22%.

Hirzel · [...] · Marc A Baldo Discovering new OLED emitters requires many experiments to synthesize candidates and test performance in devices. Large scale computer simulation can greatly speed this search process but the problem remains challenging enough that brute force application of massive computing power is not enough to successfully identify novel structures. We report a successful High Throughput Virtual Screening study that leveraged a range of methods to optimize the search process. The generation of candidate structures was constrained to contain combinatorial explosion. Simulations were tuned to the specific problem and calibrated with experimental results. Experimentalists and theorists actively collaborated such that experimental feedback was regularly utilized to update and shape the computational search. Supervised machine learning methods prioritized candidate structures prior to quantum chemistry simulation to prevent wasting compute on likely poor performers. With this combination of techniques, each multiplying the strength of the search, this effort managed to navigate an area of molecular space and identify hundreds of promising OLED candidate structures. An experimentally validated selection of this set shows emitters with external quantum efficiencies as high as 22%.

Baldo Mixed host compositions that combine chargetransportmaterials with luminescent dyes offer superior control over exciton formation and chargetransport in organic light emitting devices (OLEDs). Two approaches are typically used to optimize the fraction of chargetransportmaterials in a mixed host composition: either an empirical percolative model, or a hopping transport model. We show that these two commonly-employed models are linked by an analytic expression which relates the localization length to the percolation threshold and critical exponent. The relation is confirmed both numerically and experimentally through measurements of the relative conductivity of Tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine (TCTA) :1,3-bis(3,5-dipyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene (BmPyPb) mixtures with different concentrations, where the TCTA plays a role as hole conductor and the BmPyPb as hole insulator. The analytic relation may allow the rational design of mixed layers of small molecules for high-performance OLEDs.

Both Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) and Ir(F2-m-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) exhibited high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of 75 ± 5% and 76 ± 5% in films, respectively. The DFT calculation demonstrated that the new blue iridium complexes have a wide bandgap compared with FIrpic and the Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) with a trimethylsilyl group in the para position has a slightly deeper HOMO level than that of the Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) with a trimethylsilyl group in the meta position. The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescent (PL) spectra of the complexes were blue shifted compared with those of FIrpic. The device using the Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19.3% (at 0.00152 mA cm−2) and commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.145, 0.247).

It is according to the Merrield model that the singlet character of the T 1 T 1 pair determines its coupling to the singlet state. 18 Hence, annihilators with a triplet-pair state exhibiting a signicant singlet character can have a high probability of singlet formation and consequently, a higher f factor 19 which has been investigated in this work by calculating the percentage of charge resonance/transfer character in the S 0 S 1 dimer. ...

Among the numerous reported c-MOFs, the triphenylene-based (HXTP) conjugated ligands (e.g., HHTP: 2,3,6,7,10,11hexahydroxytriphenylene), stand out as one of the most extensively studied organic linkers to date. [3,19, 20] In addition, the coordination groups of triphenylene-based ligands can undergo deprotonation during the coordination process, enabling the potential to exhibit multiple oxidation states. However, when coordinated with common divalent metal ions (e.g., Cu 2+ , Ni 2+ , Co 2+ ), the ligands become fully coordinated in a saturated intralayer square-planar geometry, resulting in a fixed oxidation state (−3) and a predetermined framework topology [2,3,19,[21][22][23] (Figure 1). ...

This aspect of Na-based complexes has game-changing potential for constructing molecular systems where enhanced non-covalent interactions are required, for instance, in materials science or drug design. 48,49 TSEC between donor and acceptor ligands also bears great potential for the development of new emitter classes as it promotes the formation of through-space charge transfer (TSCT) excited states, 41, 43, 44,50,51 which commonly enhances rISC by reducing DE ST due to the absence of through-bond D-A conjugation. As a result, non-radiative deactivation can be suppressed in favor of improved PL performance. ...

The absorption band at 303 nm is assigned to an iridium-based spin allowed metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) transition, while the low-energy absorption shoulder at approximately 450 nm is assigned to spin-forbidden triplet 3MLCT transitions according to the peak assignment of a similar iridium(III) complex [55] .
