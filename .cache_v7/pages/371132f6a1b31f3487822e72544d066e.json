In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces little or no insulin. In type 2, the body canât use insulin effectively. Thatâs where food comes in. Every meal you eat, especially rich in carbs, triggers a response. When most people hear âcarbsâ and âdiabetesâ in the same sentence, panic sets in. Bread? Rice? Pasta? Suddenly everything seems like the enemy. But hereâs the thing: not all carbs hit your blood sugar the same way. And thatâs where the glycemic index, or GI, comes in. GI is basically a ranking system for carbs. It tells you how quickly a food raises your blood sugar after you eat it. High GI foods, like white bread or sugary drinks, spike your glucose fast. Low GI foods, like lentils, oats, or most vegetables, release sugar slowly. And that slow release is exactly what your body needs to keep blood sugar steady, especially if you have diabetes. Diabetes diet: The right kind of macronutrients to add to the diet Why is it important to learn about dietary interventions? Diet related diseases like heart diseases, diabetes are major contributors to global morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) says an unhealthy diet is one of the major risk factors for a range of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and other conditions linked to obesity. Unhealthy diets is one of the major contributors of the deaths caused by non communicable diseases, which is at least 43 million people in 2021, equivalent to 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths globally. \"Instead of consuming foods that are higher in glycemic index (GI) than sugar, it's preferable to consume natural, whole foods with a lower GI as they will take longer to break down in our bodies, which may help stabilize blood sugar levels,\" says Dr Aastha Sharma, Chief Dietitian, Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital, Sector 20,Faridabad. \"Foods that tend to cause a more rapid rise in blood sugar than table sugar include: white bread (made with refined flour) white rice (which is not high in fiber) cornflakes (and most processed breakfast cereals) due to the speed at which they are digested mashed potatoes (and fried potatoes) as they convert into glucose almost immediately baked goods which typically consist of refined carbs added sugars and therefore cause a spike in blood sugar levels Fruit juices are also low in fiber, as they are generally just the juice pressed from a fruit with little or no fiber, making them appear like a pure sugar for the body to metabolise,\" says the dietitian. \"Instant noodles are another form of refined carbohydrates. Instant noodles are typically high in glycemic load.\" \"Low-fiber and highly processed food will increase your blood sugar level rapidly due to their rapid digestion and absorption of glucose. To help decrease the rate of blood sugar spikes with food, use low glycemic index (GI) options â for example, choose whole grains instead of refined grains and eat whole fruits instead of fruit juices. Combining carbohydrates with protein or healthy fats, such as nuts, yogurt, or eggs, is a smart way to help regulate blood sugars. Eating high-fiber vegetables before carbohydrate-rich foods will also help to decrease how quickly your blood sugar levels spike after eating them. Try to avoid consuming refined carbohydrates alone on an empty stomach, and instead, opt for beans, lentils, and other vegetables over starchy foods when possible,\" the expert suggests. Pain that shows up at night: Doctor explains the strange pattern of pain that waits for the lights to go off Surprising triggers of blood sugar Apart from these, there are certain surprising triggers of blood sugar. As per US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), some causes of blood sugar might surprise you. It says sunburn causes stress that increases blood sugar levels. It says dehydration or having less water in your body means your blood sugar is more concentrated. The CDC report further says nose sprays have certain chemicals that trigger your liver to make more blood sugar. Losing sleep even for one night can make your body ineffective in utilising insulin well.
