  "data": "Fact-checked by Grok 2 weeks ago Ha Dong-kyun Ha Dong-kyun (Korean: 하동균; born June 28, 1980), professionally known as Ha Dong Qn, is a South Korean singer-songwriter recognized for his distinctive husky voice and emotive power ballads. [1] [2] Active in the K-pop industry for over two decades, he has built a career spanning group performances, solo releases, and television appearances, earning acclaim for his vocal depth and songwriting. [3] Ha began his music career in 2002 as a member of the short-lived boy band 7Dayz, which disbanded shortly after debut. [1] In 2004, he joined the YG Entertainment group Wanted, releasing their debut album before the group entered a three-year hiatus following the tragic death of member Seo Jae-hyo in a car accident. [3] Transitioning to a solo path, Ha released his debut studio album Stand Alone in 2006, followed by Another Corner in 2008, marking his establishment as a ballad specialist. [4] Among his most notable works are the hit singles \"Please Love Her\" from Stand Alone and \"Butterfly\" from Another Corner , which highlighted his ability to convey heartfelt emotion through soaring melodies. [3] Beyond music, Ha has contributed as a vocal trainer, notably mentoring IU early in her career, and frequently appears on singing variety shows such as I Can See Your Voice and Immortal Songs . [3] In recent years, he has continued releasing extended plays like Mark (2012) and participating in media, including confirming his relationship status on the MBC variety show Hangout with Yoo in 2024. [5] Early life and education Family and childhood Ha Dong-kyun was born on June 28, 1980, in Jungnang-gu, Seoul, South Korea. [1] Public information about his immediate family is limited, but he was raised by his parents alongside an older sister. [6] This modest family background in a Seoul neighborhood appears to have fostered his relatable and grounded public persona, though specific details on his parents' occupations or home life are not widely documented. [6] From a young age, Ha Dong-kyun showed an affinity for music, particularly rock, which he listened to avidly and even performed as a vocalist in a high school rock band—marking his initial forays into singing without any mention of formal training at that stage. [6] These early local influences in Seoul helped shape his passion for music, setting the foundation for his later career pursuits. Schooling and early interests Ha Dong-kyun attended and graduated from Hansol High School in Gyeonggi Province. [1] [6] During his high school years, he participated in the rock band Sinabro as a vocalist, alongside fellow student and future bandmate Lee Jeong from 7Dayz, which helped cultivate his early passion for music. [6] He developed an interest in rock music from a young age, frequently listening to rock bands and identifying as a \"rock nerd.\" [6] Prior to university, Ha Dong-kyun had no formal music education, instead honing his skills through self-directed practice and amateur involvement in school musical activities. [6] He later graduated from Chungwoon University with a bachelor's degree in Broadcast Musicology and attended Kyung Hee University Graduate School. [1] [6] Career Debut with music groups Ha Dong-kyun entered the K-pop industry in 2002 as a member of the R&B boy band 7Dayz, formed alongside Lee Jung, Jeon Sang-hwan, Seo Jae-ho, and YJ. [1] The group debuted that year with their self-titled album, which featured tracks blending R&B influences but achieved limited commercial success, leading to their quick disbandment shortly after release. [7] This early venture marked Ha's initial foray into group performances, where he contributed vocals amid the rigorous training typical of aspiring idols in the competitive South Korean music scene. [1] In 2004, Ha joined the boy band Wanted, reuniting with former 7Dayz members Jeon Sang-hwan and Seo Jae-ho, along with Kim Jae-suk. [7] As a key vocalist known for his deep voice and wide range, Ha played a prominent role in the group's R&B-focused sound, contributing to their debut album and subsequent releases like the 2007 project 7 Dayz & Wanted , which revisited elements from his prior group. [1] Wanted gained some traction with tracks such as \"Always,\" featured on the OST for the TV series Nine-Tailed Fox , and held a sold-out concert for 1,000 fans just two months after one album's release, highlighting their growing fanbase. [7] However, the group faced significant setbacks, entering a primary hiatus from 2004 to 2007 following the accident, with intermittent activity including releases in 2007 and 2012, followed by longer periods of inactivity until limited activity in 2019–2020. [1] As a young idol in both groups, Ha encountered substantial challenges, including the physical and emotional demands of intensive training regimens and the limited opportunities for individual recognition within ensemble dynamics. [7] A tragic car accident while returning from a schedule in Busan in August 2004 resulted in the death of member Seo Jae-ho and injuries to the surviving members, including Ha, forcing temporary suspensions of activities and requiring his rehabilitation for about two years. [7] [8] These experiences underscored the precarious nature of early idol life, marked by high risks and collective rather than personal spotlight. [1] Transition to solo artistry After the tragic car accident involving his group Wanted in August 2004, which resulted in the death of member Seo Jae-ho and serious injuries to Ha Dong-kyun himself, the group entered a hiatus, during which he began pursuing a solo career while remaining a member. [8] Drawing from the experience gained in R&B ensembles like 7Dayz and Wanted, he adopted the stage name Ha Dong Qn and focused on a more personal artistic direction. [1] Ha Dong Qn made his solo debut on June 27, 2006, with the full-length album Stand Alone , released under WS Entertainment following a label transition from M-Boat. [9] The title track, \"Please Love Her\" (그녀를 사랑해줘요), a heartfelt R&B ballad, charted highly, reaching the top 5 on major Korean music programs and garnering widespread attention for its emotional depth, while the follow-up single \"Reincarnation\" (환생) also achieved success. [10] [6] Critics and fans particularly noted his distinctive husky, deep chest voice, which contrasted his earlier group styles and added a raw intensity to the album's ballad-heavy tracks, helping to establish his vocal identity despite the two-year hiatus from the accident. [11] Early in his solo phase, Ha Dong Qn faced ongoing challenges, including recovery from physical and emotional trauma stemming from the 2004 accident, which had caused PTSD and a temporary loss of memory regarding the event. [6] These struggles, compounded by label shifts and the pressure to rebuild his career independently, shaped his shift toward a ballad-centric sound, emphasizing introspective lyrics and his resonant timbre to connect with listeners seeking emotional authenticity. [12] The album Stand Alone itself reached No. 9 on South Korean charts, signaling a promising yet hard-fought start to his individual artistry. [12] Major releases and collaborations Ha Dong-kyun's second studio album, Another Corner , released in 2008, marked a significant evolution in his solo career, shifting toward emotive power ballads that showcased his vocal range and emotional depth. Key tracks such as \"If I Loved You Again,\" \"Brown Eyes,\" and \"Butterfly\" highlighted this stylistic turn, blending introspective lyrics with orchestral arrangements to explore themes of regret and longing. [13] [14] Following a period of relative hiatus, Ha Dong-kyun returned with a series of extended plays that emphasized personal growth and artistic maturity. His 2012 EP Mark introduced more experimental sounds while maintaining his ballad roots, achieving moderate commercial success on Korean charts. The 2014 EP Word , described as a \"musical autobiography,\" delved into honest reflections on life and relationships, earning praise for its raw vocal delivery and songwriting. In 2017, under his newly founded independent label Mark Planet, he released Polygon , which further explored multifaceted personal narratives and peaked in the top 20 on domestic music platforms, solidifying his reputation as a thoughtful solo artist. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In recent years, Ha Dong-kyun has continued to build on his songwriting prowess, contributing lyrics and compositions to his own works that reflect a trajectory of resilience and introspection. His 2024 single I Will exemplifies this, offering a poignant ballad on enduring love that resonated widely upon release. [20] Notable collaborations include live performances with singer Punch at the 2019 GLAD Music Festival in Jeju, where their duet highlighted harmonious vocal interplay, and joint tracks like \"Beautiful Day\" with J.Lee. [21] Beyond recordings, Ha has worked as a vocal trainer, mentoring artists like IU early in her career, and has made frequent appearances on singing variety shows such as I Can See Your Voice and Immortal Songs: Singing the Legend since the 2010s. In 2024, he appeared on the MBC variety show Hangout with Yoo , where he discussed personal matters including his relationship status.

[9] The album features 13 tracks, primarily in the ballad genre, showcasing his signature husky vocal style and emotional depth in themes of love, heartbreak, and longing. [22] Key highlights include the lead single \"Please Love Her\" (그녀를 사랑해줘요), a poignant power ballad that became a major hit, and the follow-up \"Reincarnation\" (환생), which also gained widespread popularity for its introspective lyrics and soaring melodies.

[25] Standout singles include \"Butterfly\" (나비), a powerful ballad that climbed charts steadily, and \"Please Love Her, Pt. 2,\" a sequel expanding on the original's themes with richer orchestration. [26] Critics noted the album's strength in Ha's vocal range and lyrical growth, describing it as a solid continuation of his husky ballad expertise while experimenting with emotional layering.

The lead single \"Run\" highlighted his emotive vocal delivery and phrasing, while songs like \"Gap\" and \"Knots\" showcased dynamic range, blending warm, earthy tones with instrumental builds; it achieved modest chart success, with \"Knots\" reaching number 70. [16] [31] In 2017, Ha Dong-kyun founded the independent label Mark Planet and self-released Polygon on May 11, comprising five tracks that took artistic risks with genre-blending pop and rock elements to signal a career reboot. Key single \"The Maze of Reality\" explored complex emotional landscapes, supported by tracks like \"Beautiful Things\" and \"Blooms,\" which received positive reception for their innovative sound and promotional ties to live performances. The EP peaked in the top 20 on domestic charts, affirming its impact.

Performed live on MBC's Music Core in December 2006, it showcased Ha's vocal range in a soulful R&B style and helped maintain momentum from the album's initial success.

The song peaked at number 70 on the Gaon Digital Chart during its 42nd week, reflecting modest but steady digital performance with around 33,000 downloads.

It entered the Soompi Weekly K-Pop Chart at number 49 in June 2015 and peaked at number 27 on the Gaon Digital Chart, bolstered by its feel-good melody and duet chemistry.
