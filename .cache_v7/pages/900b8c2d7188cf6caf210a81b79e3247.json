With a career spanning nearly seven decades, Lee was a credited actor in at least 266 feature theatrical films. He was well known for portraying Count Dracula in a sequence of Hammer Horror films, beginning with Dracula (1958). His other film roles include Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond action film The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequel trilogy (2002–2005), and Saruman in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001–2003) and The Hobbit film trilogy (2012–2014). Lee was knighted for services to drama and charity in 2009. He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 2011 and the BFI Fellowship in 2013. [ 1 ] He considered his best performance to be that of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the biopic Jinnah (1998), and his best film to be the British cult film The Wicker Man (1973). [ 2 ] He frequently appeared opposite his friend Peter Cushing in numerous horror films, and late in his career had roles in five Tim Burton films .
