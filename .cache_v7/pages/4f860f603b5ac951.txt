Meet members of the community and share your knowledge Help Forums Community Slack Events LangChain Community Champions Building LangChain is a team effort — over 3,500 amazing contributors have poured their time into making LangChain the vibrant ecosystem it is today. Our Community Champions are our MVPs — squashing bugs, tackling issues, adding new features, and crafting great docs. Not all heroes wear capes; some submit incredible PRs! And we’re here to celebrate them. Community Champions enjoy direct access to the LangChain team, influence the roadmap, get priority reviews, and, of course, score some company swag. cbornet marlenezw sepiatone afirstenberg clemenspeters gbaian10 LangChain Experts LangChain Experts are our community’s go-to helpers — volunteers who jump in to answer questions, share best practices, and spark great discussions.
