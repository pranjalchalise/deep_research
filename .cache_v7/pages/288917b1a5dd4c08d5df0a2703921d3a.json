In many ways they seem pretty similar even though one emphasizes hierarchy but it seems like deep agents accomplishes the same thing. I know its based on use case and all that but can anyone give their opinion on what is a better standard or library to follow if we are diving deep into building and customizing agent systems using langgraph. I have built my own react library and supervisor (multi agent library) mainly for controlling more things, getting inspiration from the supervisor repo, and I am trying to keep it up to date with the lastest developments. github.com GitHub - langchain-ai/deepagents: Deepagents is an agent harness built on langchain... Deepagents is an agent harness built on langchain and langgraph. Deep agents are equipped with a planning tool, a filesystem backend, and the ability to spawn subagents - making them well-equipped to handle complex agentic tasks. github.com GitHub - langchain-ai/langgraph-supervisor-py Contribute to langchain-ai/langgraph-supervisor-py development by creating an account on GitHub.
