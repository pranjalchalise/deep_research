Quote reply zzzlip Oct 17, 2025 - Discussion Type General Discussion Content In the fast-evolving world of AI, agent development is booming, and LangChain + LangGraph are leading platforms driving massive interest. However, existing video tutorials often lack depth. To bridge this gap, I've created an in-depth documentation project. https://github.com/zzzlip/langgraph-AI-interview-agent This guide dives deep into building intelligent agents by leveraging the strengths of LangChain and LangGraph. It combines my hands-on experience with detailed tutorials on core components, rooted in official documentation. Beyond technical knowledge, it includes my insights and complete, practical code examples to help you master agent development. The document is actively updated, currently covering multi-agent architectures, with upcoming sections on callback mechanisms, human-in-the-loop interactions, time travel, and agent evaluation. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced developer, this resource will empower you to create sophisticated AI agents. Join the discussion, share your feedback, and stay tuned for more updates! Coming soon: a LlamaIndex-based RAG tutorial series covering embedding fine-tuning, knowledge base setup, advanced retrieval, and evaluation. Check out the full guide and let’s build smarter agents together! Beta Was this translation helpful?
