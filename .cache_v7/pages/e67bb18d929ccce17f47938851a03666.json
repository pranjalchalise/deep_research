If you look at his credentials, you may not deny that he is one of the most educated among those heading major political parties in India. As a RTI activist, his work is commendable and his contribution to improving transparency in the governance is immense. Though he was sent to jail, he couldn't be charged for anything. It seems like the action against him was the part of political vendetta. In 2024 Loksabha elections, the opposition was united but they couldn't have consensus on PM candidate. Again, many vote for BJP because they hate Rahul Gandhi. Considering all of the above, would you like to have AK as the next PM? A request : Keep the discussion civil and do not copy paste any argument made by any political party opposing Kejriwal. The idea is to share our own thoughts devoid of any influence. Edit : If not AK then who? Who is the most suitable according to you? Read more Share"
