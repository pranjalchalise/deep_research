  "data": "Order of Program Welcome Michael A. Elliott ’92, President “Hymn to Amherst” Performed by the Amherst College Glee Club Led by Alexandra Conklin ’25 Remarks Michael A. Elliott ’92, President Reading of Graduate Names Martha M. Umphrey, Provost and Dean of the Faculty Reception to follow at the Science Center Living Room History of the E Celebration The E Celebration is an annual tradition at Amherst College that celebrates students who complete their degree requirements in the fall semester. For some, the E Celebration is a precursor to the Commencement events; for others, the event is the culmination of their years at Amherst College. At the E Celebration, each student receives a tassel and a 2026E Conway Cane. History of the Conway Canes The canes are a 19th-century tradition revived and reshaped in 2003 by the student members of the Friends of the Library, who were seeking a connection with Amherst traditions for the class graduating that year. The canes celebrate class unity and spirit and are now known as the Conway Canes, in honor of a gift from Brian J. Conway ’80 and Kevin J. Conway ’80 to endow the Fund for College Canes. The Conway Canes are presented to all seniors to mark their graduation from Amherst and to serve as an enduring symbol of connection to their class and to their alma mater. Hymn to Amherst In the light of Amherst eyes Her beauty lives forever, Still as shining as the ties That bind our lives together. In the temple of these hills Beauty has her altar, Where the eye of mem’ry thrills To Amherst, ever fair. In the strength of Amherst minds True learning shall not wither, Nor the joy of one who finds What seeking brought us hither. Those who teach and those who learn Build a living city, Where the eye and mind return To Amherst, ever free. In the love of Amherst hearts Abides her greatest glory, As the future still imparts The old, unchanging story. Youth and beauty, learning, faith, Bound by friendship’s charter To the college we have made With eye and mind and heart.
