  "data": "scVelo - RNA velocity generalized through dynamical modeling Edit on GitHub scVelo - RNA velocity generalized through dynamical modeling  scVelo is a scalable toolkit for RNA velocity analysis in single cells; RNA velocity enables the recovery of directed dynamic information by leveraging splicing kinetics [ Manno et al. , 2018 ] . scVelo collects different methods for inferring RNA velocity using an expectation-maximization framework [ Bergen et al. , 2020 ] or metabolically labeled transcripts [ Weiler et al. , 2024 ] . scVelo’s key applications  estimate RNA velocity to study cellular dynamics. identify putative driver genes and regimes of regulatory changes. infer a latent time to reconstruct the temporal sequence of transcriptomic events. estimate reaction rates of transcription, splicing and degradation. use statistical tests, e.g., to detect different kinetics regimes.
