Claudiu Dumitrache began his musical career at the age of 12, performing over 3,000 shows. Now, at just 25, he is the most prolific young Romanian writer, with nine published books to his name. One of the defining aspects of Dumitrache’s artistic and literary work is his dedication to promoting Orthodox Christianity, a faith to which King Charles himself has shown a growing affinity in recent years. Through his cultural initiatives, Dumitrache bridges Romania’s rich spiritual traditions with the modern world, ensuring that the timeless values of faith, identity, and heritage remain at the heart of artistic expression. Hailed as “ a true star of European culture ” in California, Dumitrache has dedicated his life to art and has been working since a young age, striving to bring joy to people’s hearts. His travels through the United States, Europe and Asia have broadened his worldview, making him a strong advocate of universal values. In recognition of his cultural contributions, he was named Ambassador of Culture by the Euro Education Federation in Europe and European Artist of the Month in Beverly Hills in August 2024. At the beginning of his musical career, Mihai Claudiu Dumitrache was mentored by Miley Cyrus, who taught him to perform “ The Climb ” in 2012. The song earned him his first accolades, and he later shared with Beverly Hills Magazine that his memories of Miley remain among the most cherished of his life. Dumitrache’s innovative literary contribution Magazines in Chicago and California have highlighted that he is an artist with a unique personality, one of the few young people promoting Eastern culture in his books and work. Regarding Claudiu Dumitrache’s poetry, Jonathan Jackson wrote that “ the personal nature of these poems allows them to rise to the universal in their honesty and longing. Art is a meta-language, as the filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky has said. Claudiu Dumitraches’ poetry enters into this “meta-language” and invites the heart to contemplate life on the most essential levels. Here, is a powerful of example of what St. Porphyrios meant when he said, “Whoever wants to become a Christian, must first become a poet.” Poetry is the land of paradox and experience – this is the archetypal landscape of the Eternal Word. ” With an erudite yet accessible writing style, Dumitrache masterfully combines philosophical depth with poetic sensitivity. One of his books, “ Albert Einstein și dorul firesc de Ortodoxie ”, a premium book designated by the Romanian Broadcasting Society, explores Einstein’s spirituality and the significant role of Orthodox Christianity in society. Once a follower of the New Age movement, Claudiu Dumitrache now seeks to educate young people about its potential pitfalls. Like Jonathan Jackson, he advocates Orthodoxy as a path to both personal and communal fulfilment. For his literary contributions and philosophical vision, Claudiu Dumitrache is regarded as the legacy or message of Mihai Eminescu in contemporary times. According to Hollywood Progressive , Claudiu’s admiration for Mihai Eminescu led him to write a long poem dedicated to Romania’s national poet – an Orthodox akathist appreciated in academic circles. Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop, an academician and president of the Romanian Academy, described Claudiu as “ a profound connoisseur of Orthodox theology, a poet endowed with the sensitivity of a poet, and an admirer and refiner of Eminescu’s work .” Furthermore, he hailed Claudiu Dumitrache as “ a symbol for the future of intellectual creation ,” as well as “ an intellectual capable of uniting souls ” and an artist “ who will carry the arts forward .” Claudiu Dumitrache’s remarkable achievements include being recognised in Romania’s Book of Records for publishing his autobiography at the age of just 20. He was also awarded the Romanian Professional Journalists’ Union Prize, becoming the youngest laureate in the history of Romanian press . His literary and journalistic excellence has earned him further accolades, including honours from Literatura și Arta , one of Moldova’s most prestigious publications, which named him “ a notable personality in culture and public life ”. A revelation from Wallachia The renowned historian Pop further praised Dumitrache as “ a bearer and creator of culture, rare to find today in Wallachia. ” A journalist from New York echoed this sentiment, calling him “ a revelation from Wallachia .” British composer Michael James Down stated that he always knew that “ Claudiu Dumitrache has a fantastic voice and the right charisma to be an international artist .” Down discovered that “ Claudiu’s way of working is unlike anyone else’s ” and that he is “ the type of person who makes things happen! ” Several media outlets have also highlighted his connections with notable figures such as businessman Michael Koch (a Forbes Council member), businesswoman Cheryl Shuman, Marian Gold from Alphaville, Jakob Petren, and Michaela Rose from Arabesque. The latter also expressed her admiration for the Romanian artist’s personality. The famous singer of the hit “ Midnight Dancer ,” who continues to perform with the band Arabesque, remarked that Claudiu is “ a very spiritual person ” and possesses “ a very sensitive and romantic voice .” Isaac C. Cates (from the Grammy Awards committee) and Andrei Zincă are also notable figures who have commented on Claudiu Dumitrache’s artistic complexity. According to Beverly Hills Magazine , Dumitrache has been nominated for a music award in Las Vegas in recent years, and on this occasion, actor Michael Airington said that one of the things that impresses him about Claudiu is his drive and determination. “ Not only is he an incredibly talented singer and performer, but his drive and perseverance are what it takes to be successful in life. I can say, Claudiu is the real deal . ” – Michael Airington The leader of prestigious and innovative projects in Romanian culture In Romania, the country where King Charles has professed to feelat home and which he has described as “the land of glory, the land of longing” (quoting the national poet Mihai Eminescu), Claudiu Dumitrache is the founder of Myosotis Media Group , an organisation dedicated to promoting excellence in the arts, sciences, sports, and business. As President of the Certification Commission for Quality, Performance, and Excellence within the Myosotis Awards, he has played a key role in recognising outstanding contributions across multiple fields. At the 2024 Contemporary Values ceremony, Patriarch Daniel of Romania personally congratulated Dumitrache for his promotion of Christian cultural and spiritual values. Initially presented at the prestigious Radar de Media Galas , which Dumitrache co-organised alongside producer Raluca Găină, the awards are now a highlight of the Contemporary Values Gala . Under the patronage of Romania’s Ministry of Culture, these projects bring together leading figures from academia in both Romania and the Republic of Moldova, further cementing their impact on the region’s intellectual and artistic landscape.With its growing reputation, the Myosotis Awards have become Romania’s most significant independent honours, often compared to the Oscars and Grammys for their influence and prestige in Romania. “ In a world where we are gradually losing our sense of identity, organising an event of this kind – one that promotes culture, national identity, history, and art, and opens with the National Anthem – is not only an exceptionally significant occasion but should also set the standard for all similar events in the future ,” declared journalist George Grigoriu at the Myosotis Awards 2024. Dumitrache is also the organizer of festivals such as the National Science and Art Festival “ Basarab Fest ” and the founder of the Royal Literary Magazine Awards . According to MSN, Deadline and soapsindepth.com , this award was given to Jonathan Jackson in 2022, for his “ contribution to the understanding of authentic art, for literary works written with inspiration and talent, for highlighting the values ​​of Eastern culture .” Rise as a hope Claudiu Dumitrache has been named among Romania’s top five exceptional young talents , joining an elite group that includes Olympic swimmer David Popovici, ballerina Francesca Velicu (of the English National Ballet), countertenor Alexandru Costea, and footballer Radu Drăgușin (of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club). Ema Tănase from the Matricea Românească Association highlighted the significance of their achievements, emphasising that “ they play a key role in shifting perceptions within Romania and demonstrating that the country can compete at the highest global level .” Through his visionary leadership, Claudiu Dumitrache continues to shape the future of Romanian culture on an international scale. William P. Barret declared in a Chicago magazine that “ we are dealing with a remarkable artist who seems to rise as a hope in a country that still faces corruptionand where European values ​​are difficult to integrate .” Through his work with young artists in Romania, Claudiu Dumitrache has become a beacon of inspiration, encouraging the new generation to embrace their cultural heritage while striving for global recognition, all while preserving the spiritual foundations of Christianity. Claudiu’s work extends beyond artistic expression, advocating a philosophy of unity and peace that deeply resonates with his audiences. His message inspires individuals to reflect on their own spiritual journeys and to embrace the cultural diversity that enriches the world. For his efforts in promoting peace, he was honoured as an Ambassador of Peace by the World Literary Forum for Peace and Human Rights in India. In addition to his artistic endeavours, Claudiu is actively engaged in charitable work, supporting various causes that seek to improve access to education and foster cultural exchange, in his role as a Cultural Ambassador of the Euro Education Federation. His commitment to making a meaningful impact on the world exemplifies the core values of his artistic vision. As an affiliated member of the Centre for Philosophical Practices, Philosophical Consultancy, and Counselling within the Academic Society for the Research of Religions and Ideologies, he delivers lectures to help students understand the connection between science and faith, the role of art, and the importance of prayer in life.
