Is sweeping age-based ban the only answer? Can Delhi-NCR continually dump its 10-15 year old vehicles on other regions forever? Is this scalable and sustainable? My quick take on this: 1:WHY ACT ON OLD AND END OF LIFE VEHICLES (ELVS)? These vehicles were designed under significantly weaker emission norms compared to the current BS6 vehicles. Wear, tear and malfunction further worsen emissions. But older vehicles and ELVs are not the same. Define ELV criteria (malfunctioning, high emitters, past their useful life) to weed them out. 2.CAN PUC CATCH GROSS POLLUTERS EFFECTIVELY? Not effectively. This idle engine emissions test cannot measure pollutants under varied real-world driving conditions. 3. SHOULD WE TARGET GENERICALLY OR IN A TARGETED WAY? A smaller fraction of vehicles spew disproportionately high share of emissions. Identify and target them. 4. HOW? Link age-based bans with fitness, maintenance, and emissions performance. But upgrade and automate testing systems, mandate multiple tests for all older vehicles (post 10 year). Tax them higher. 5. DO WE HAVE UPGRADED TESTING SYSTEMS? Delhi has a state-of-the-art Automated Testing Stations (ATS) for commercial vehicles. MoRTH has mandated compulsory testing in ATS. Delhi needs 100% compliance. But ensure that a process of test, retest and appeal do not dilute this system. As per VAHAN database, out of 8.7 lakh vehicles tested in ATS nationally, only 304 vehicles are officially declared as ELVs- too small to justify capital investments in scrappage centres. 6. HOW TO MAKE UPGRADED TESTING, SMART MONITORING AND INSPECTION WORK? Disclose vehicle-wise test/retest data, declare the list of ELVs publicly; Remotely audit the ATS and PUC centres. Expand ATS facilities for testing of private vehicles defaulting on road. Immediately implement remote sensing monitoring of on-road vehicles as per the Supreme Court directives,2018, to identify high polluters to pull them off the road. 7. HOW TO SUPPORT PHASE OUT AND FLEET RENEWAL? Begin with the worst polluting commercial vehicles and gradually include others. Provide financial incentives and tax concessions (as per MoRTH rule) but link with BS6 and electric vehicle purchases. Utilise revenue from environment compensation charge on trucks, big diesel cars and diesel fuel etc, to fund this transition. 8. AGE BANS ARE NEEDED WHEN SYSTEMS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF ELVS ARE NOT IN PLACE OR ARE NOT WORKING EFFICIENTLY. Surely, Delhi can make this work with advanced smart monitoring, stringent compliance, penalty and targeted age ban. 9. REMEMBER: - public outcry over any restrictions on cars and two-wheelers of any age is stoked by the lack of adequate mass transport options. Therefore massively augment public transport and mobility systems, fleet electrification along with parking restraints to also restrain personal vehicle usage. 118 16 Comments Explore collaborative articles We’re unlocking community knowledge in a new way.
