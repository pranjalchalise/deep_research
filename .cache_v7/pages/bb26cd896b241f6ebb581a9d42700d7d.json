  "data": "Since its founding in 1821, Amherst College has prepared talented students of every background to lead principled lives of consequence. Education as a pressing social issue has captured the attention of generations of Amherst College students, and alumni who have pursued a calling in education consistently report how their Amherst education provided a sound foundation for their work. With the support and leadership of Charles “Chuck” Ashby Lewis ’64 and Penny Bender Sebring, Ph.D., Amherst’s Careers in Education Professions Career Community encourages students to explore, experience, and reflect upon a variety of paths into the education professions.
