How do pythons differ from venomous snakes? python , any of about 40 species of snakes , all but one of which are found in the Old World tropics and subtropics. Most are large, with the reticulated python ( Malayopython reticulatus ) of Asia being the longest, with the largest adults measuring 7–8 meters (23–26.2 feet) in length, but there are reports from the island of Celebes (Sulawesi) dating to 1912 of an individual that measured 10 meters (32.8 feet) long. reticulated python ( Malayopython reticulatus ) A snake collector holding a reticulated python ( Malayopython reticulatus ) on the street in Jakarta, Indonesia. (more) Most pythons are terrestrial to semiarboreal, and a few, such as the green tree python ( Morelia viridis ) of Australia and New Guinea , are strongly arboreal. Terrestrial pythons are regularly found near water and are proficient swimmers, but they hunt and eat almost exclusively on land. Larger pythons prey mainly on mammals and birds; smaller species also eat amphibians and reptiles. Pythons have good senses of smell and sight, and most can also detect heat. Pits lying between the lip scales have receptors that are sensitive to infrared radiation and enable pythons to “see” the heat shadow of mammals and birds even during the darkest night. Prey is captured by striking and biting, usually followed by constriction. When swallowing prey, pythons secrete a mucus that contains harmless trace amounts of venom proteins. Pythons are egg layers (oviparous) rather than live-bearers (viviparous). Females of most, if not all, species coil around the eggs, and some actually brood them. Brooders select thermally stable nesting sites, then lay their eggs and coil around them so that the eggs are in contact only with the female’s body. When the air temperature begins to drop, she generates heat by shivering in a series of minuscule muscle contractions and thus maintains an elevated and fairly constant incubation temperature.

Royal pythons are also called ball pythons due to their tendency to curl themselves up into a tight ball when they are nervous. (more) Eight species of genus Python live in sub-Saharan Africa and from India to southern China into Southeast Asia , including the Philippines and the Moluccas islands of Indonesia . Other related genera inhabit New Guinea and Australia. Some Australian pythons (genus Liasis ) never grow much longer than one metre, but some pythons of Africa ( P. sebae ), India ( P. molurus ), Southeast Asia and Java ( P. bivittatus ), New Guinea ( L. papuanus ), and Australia ( L. amethistinus ) regularly exceed 3 metres (10 feet). Despite their large size, some of these species survive in urban and suburban areas, where their secretive habits and recognized value as rat catchers par excellence serve to protect them. The Burmese python ( P. bivittatus ) also occurs in large numbers in southern Florida in North America , where it is considered to be a serious invasive species . The so-called earth , or burrowing, python ( Calabaria reinhardtii or Charina reinhardtii ) of West Africa appears to be a member of the boa family (Boidae).

The only native New World python ( Loxocemus bicolor ) is classified as the sole member of the family Loxocemidae. It is an egg layer found in forests from southern Mexico to Costa Rica . Usually less than 1 metre (3.3 feet) long, it is reported to reach nearly 1.5 metres (5 feet). It seems to be predominantly nocturnal , foraging on the ground for a variety of small vertebrates.
