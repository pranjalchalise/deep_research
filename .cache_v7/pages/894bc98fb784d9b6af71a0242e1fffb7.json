In this article, we'll dive deep into the useState() hook, its syntax, and usage examples. Explanation of useState() Hook: The useState() hook takes an initial value (String, Number, Array, Object, etc) as its argument and returns a pair of values: the current state and a function to update the state. This powerful hook enables functional components to have state management capabilities similar to class components. Examples const [ state , setState ] = useState ( initialState ); // Good const [ state , setState ] = useState (). // Bad Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode In the above example JavaScript array destructuring is used. It means that we’re making two new variables state and setState, The state variable holds the current value of the state, while setState is a function used to update the state. To elaborate further, consider the equivalent code without array destructuring: var stateVariable = useState ( ' banana ' ); // Returns a pair var state = stateVariable [ 0 ]; // First item in a pair var setState = stateVariable [ 1 ]; // Second item in a pair Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Explanation : When we declare a state variable with useState, it returns a pair — an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that lets us update it. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meanings. This is why we use array destructuring instead. Function version of initialValue When you have very slow and complex computation as an initialValue in state then it will take much time. So to solve this issue you can use the function version instead. import React , { useState } from \" react \" ; export default function ComplexState () { let [ fibonacci , setFibonacci ] = useState (( number = 7 ) => { console . log ( \" this will call once \" ); return FibonacciSeries ( number ); }); function FibonacciSeries ( number ) { if ( number < 2 ) return number ; return FibonacciSeries ( number - 1 ) + FibonacciSeries ( number - 2 ); } return ( < div > < h1 > Complex State < /h1 > < p > Fibonacci number of 7 : { fibonacci } < /p > < /div > ); } Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Output of above code: Objects State: In some cases, it is important to use object states as they can hold the collection of the same data. const [style, setStyle] = useState({ color: 'red, fontSize: 20 }) Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode While using object states, you have to keep one thing in mind when you try to change current state value using setState function you have to use the spread operator ( ... ) to preserve the previous state otherwise you will lose the previous state. Example: import React , { useState } from \" react \" ; export default function ObjectState () { const [ style , setStyle ] = useState ({ color : \" red \" , fontSize : 50 }); function changeStyle () { setStyle (( prevState ) => { return {... prevState , fontSize : prevState . fontSize + 2 }; }); } return ( < div > < h1 > Object State < /h1 > < p style = { style } > This is paragraph ... < /p > < button onClick = { changeStyle } > Font ++< /button > < /div > ); } Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Output of above code: And the output of the above code without using the spread operator is a style return statement (Bad Practice) Conclusion In this article, we explored the useState() hook in React and learned how to utilize it effectively. We covered the syntax, usage examples, and best practices. By leveraging the useState() hook, you can handle state management efficiently in your function-based components.
