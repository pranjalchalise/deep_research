A high-performance electromagnetic induction pump driven by rotating permanent magnets is designed to achieve a pressure head of 160 kPa and a flow rate of 3.24 L/min, which could enable the liquid metal to remove the waste heat quickly. The liquid metal-based minichannel thermal management system was established and tested experimentally to investigate the pumping capacity and cooling performance. The results show that the liquid metal cooling system can dissipate heat flux up to 242 W/cm2 with keeping the temperature rise of the heat source below 50°C. It could remarkably enhance the cooling performance by increasing the rotating speed of permanent magnets. Moreover, thermal contact resistance has a critical importance for the heat dissipation capacity. The liquid metal thermal grease is introduced to efficiently reduce the thermal contact resistance (a decrease of about 7.77 × 10−3 °C/W). This paper provides a powerful cooling strategy for thermal management of electric devices with large heat power and high heat flux. Read more View"
