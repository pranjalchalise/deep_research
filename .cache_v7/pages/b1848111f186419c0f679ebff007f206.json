A guy who’s been wrestling and boxing for a year can beat a martial artist who’s been training for 15 years. That pissed a lot of people off,” says Brazilian Jiu Jitsu prodigy, Eddie Bravo, founder of 10 th Planet Jiu Jitsu. To say that Bruce Lee was ahead of his time both philosophically and physically would be an understatement.

In doing so, Lee changed the way people think, fight, and live forever. During a famous interview on The Pierre Berton Show in December of 1971, Lee said, “Actually I do not, you know, teach karate, because I do not believe in style. If you do not have style, you can just say, here I am, you know, as a human being. How can I express myself, totally and completely?” In his quest for the ultimate expression of one's self, Lee created Jeet Kune Do, a philosophy more than a style of fighting, which means way of the intercepting fist. According to Canadian martial artist and fight analyst, Paul Lazenby, Jeet Kune Do is “…the attitude that you build your own style using whatever works for you. That very thought right there is the cornerstone of modern Mixed Martial Arts.” In celebration of Lee’s life and contribution not only to the world of martial arts, but to the world in general, Canadian clothing company Roots of Fight has released the second mini-documentary in a series of mini-docs about martial artists who have helped shape the world of modern MMA . 00:25 Sidney Crosby Emotional 🥹 TOP NEWS Volkanovski Retains Title at UFC 325 🏆 Bleacher Report 23h Fights to Make After UFC 325 ➡️ Bleacher Report 16h 🚨 Volkanovski Retains UFC Title Bleacher Report 16h Players Flying Up Draft Boards Bleacher Report 19h White Sox, Red Sox Make Trade Bleacher Report 1h TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report • 9h The 8 Biggest MLB Dominoes Left to Fall Before 2026 Spring Training Biggest storylines to watch before spring training begins 📲 Bleacher Report • 1h Raheem Morris, 49ers Reportedly Agree to DC Contract After Robert Saleh Hired by Titans Bleacher Report • 16h De'Andre Hunter Reportedly Traded to Kings From Cavs in 3-Team Deal with Bulls, Updated Rosters Bleacher Report • 1d 10 Ways the NBA Would Be Different If the Luka Dončić Trade Never Happened Bleacher Report • 2h Jarrell Miller's Toupee Punched Off By Kingsley Ibeh During Boxing Fight in Viral Photos TRENDING ON B/R Bleacher Report • 9h The 8 Biggest MLB Dominoes Left to Fall Before 2026 Spring Training Biggest storylines to watch before spring training begins 📲 Bleacher Report • 1h Raheem Morris, 49ers Reportedly Agree to DC Contract After Robert Saleh Hired by Titans Bleacher Report • 16h De'Andre Hunter Reportedly Traded to Kings From Cavs in 3-Team Deal with Bulls, Updated Rosters Bleacher Report • 1d 10 Ways the NBA Would Be Different If the Luka Dončić Trade Never Happened Bleacher Report • 2h Jarrell Miller's Toupee Punched Off By Kingsley Ibeh During Boxing Fight in Viral Photos"
