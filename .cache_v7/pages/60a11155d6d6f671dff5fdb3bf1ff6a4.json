I haven't seen much in this space since Lee Spector's \"push\" more than 20 years ago ( http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html ). I did see a mention of Push in the FAQ but it would be very interesting to compare this in detail. If I get it correctly Zyme programs are evolved on the bytecode level whereas Push's stack architecture is designed to be evolvable directly at the syntactic level? A head-to-head comparison / benchmark would be super interesting. conartist6 on Nov 18, 2024 [–] Hampshire represent! I'm also quite interested in this space.
