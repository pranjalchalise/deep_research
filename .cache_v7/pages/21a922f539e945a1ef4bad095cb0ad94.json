He emphasized the collaboration despite facing persecution and challenges, asserting that AAP's leaders remained focused on governance over the past 10 years. Agencies \"They subjected us and our party to immense persecution. We were harassed and troubled. Despite all this, when we were all released from jail in August-September, we did not make the atrocities committed against us a political issue,\" said Kejriwal. New Delhi: AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday described the two transportation projects inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi as \"momentous milestones\" in Delhi's development and claimed the projects were a reality because of the joint efforts of Centre and state governments. Modi inaugurated a 13-kilometre stretch of the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System corridor from Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad to New Ashok Nagar here and laid the foundation stone for two Metro lines. Later, addressing a press conference, Kejriwal congratulated the people of Delhi and asserted that the projects were a collaboration between the city and the central governments. Taking a dig at his critics, Kejriwal said, \"These inaugurations are a reply to those who say AAP only engages in fights.\" Referring to the challenges faced by his party, he claimed AAP leaders were imprisoned and tortured but maintained their focus on governance. \"Over the past 10 years, our tenure has shown how we kept work above everything else,\" he said. The former CM went on to talk about how AAP's top leaders, including himself, Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh and Satyendra Jain were sent to jail. \"They subjected us and our party to immense persecution. We were harassed and troubled. Despite all this, when we were all released from jail in August-September, we did not make the atrocities committed against us a political issue,\" said Kejriwal.
