ABSTRACT This chapter analyzes the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement, which was led by Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party, through the lens of Gandhian pluralist spirituality. This spirituality is anchored in the objective of truth realization through nonviolent social service. The chapter investigates the relationship of the five ethical essentials in the Hindu–Jain tradition to their application in Gandhi’s attempt to realize Ruskin and Tolstoy’s socialist ideals in real-life settings. It also explores the concept of laicization inherent in the truth-realization ideal as an antidote to the problem of corruption in India.
