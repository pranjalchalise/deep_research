It depends on the field, but at least in the social/political sciences, writers can use critique in the sense of criticism just as much as criticism itself is. At least from what I already read, the only field in which the distinction above is consistently verified is philosophy. In other fields, the use of critique in the sense of detailed analysis often verifies in older texts (100+ years). Texts from the 20th/21st century often use the terms interchangeably.

The terms critic , criticize , criticism have always had a double sense in English. The base meaning is “pass judgment on”, but in popular use the words have usually meant “pass a negative judgment on”, while in academic and literary use they have tended in the opposite direction, signifying close and dispassionate analysis which may or may not issue in a formal judgment. The French version critique was adopted into English primarily as a noun, meaning an instance of criticism, a critical essay or notice; in many cases there is no evident distinction between critic(k) and critique in this sense until the 19th century. Around 1960 academics began using critique in both nominal and verbal senses more and more frequently—at a guess, as a desperate effort to drive into thick undergraduate heads the fact that the critical endeavour in literature, art, history and philosophy is not simply a matter of expressing negative opinions. If that was the intention, it failed. Today critique in popular use is just as likely to mean ‘censure’ as ‘analyze’. “Maybe we should be that way about the first gentleman also and really critique the way they look all the time, their choice of tie, or their hair style or whatever, or maybe their weight.” —Former first lady Laura Bush on CSPAN , Jan 27 2014 Yes, to hell with all of these left communists making criticisms!

I have apparently not made myself clear: there are two meanings involved here, but they distinguish not two words, but the use of both words for different audiences.

She always said to people \"I'm not criticizing you, I'm critiquing you\" In other words she wasnt trying to hurt someone with everything they did wrong, she was pointing out specifically the things they needed to work on and how to do so. Even if it sounded harsh I believe critiquing always involves some sort of advice or reasoning to help a person grow from mistakes. While critics just say there opinion on how things are wrong. Whether it's what you say, do, how you write, think etc. Share Improve this answer Follow answered Dec 11, 2018 at 14:26 Shelby Breckenridge 1 Add a comment | -1 http://scribesalley.blogspot.com/2008/08/difference-between-critique-and.html The Difference between Critique and Criticism Criticism finds fault/Critique looks at structure Criticism looks for what's lacking/Critique finds what's working Criticism condemns what it doesn't understand/Critique asks for clarification Criticism is spoken with a cruel wit and sarcastic tongue/Critique's voice is kind, honest, and objective Criticism is negative/Critique is positive (even about what isn't working) Criticism is vague and general/Critique is concrete and specific Criticism has no sense of humor/Critique insists on laughter, too Criticism looks for flaws in the writer as well as the writing/Critique addresses only what is on the page Taken from Writing Alone, Writing Together; A Guide for Writers and Writing Groups by Judy Reeves Share Improve this answer Follow answered Apr 26, 2014 at 15:46 Apple Freejeans 570 2 2 silver badges 5 5 bronze badges 4 2 This is an entirely idiolectal understanding of the terms which bears no relation to their actual use.

But Judy Reeves and her published work are quite accepted and accredited, and this was her guide to use, not meaning. Your fiction was stated quite pleasantly, though.

But Ms. Reeves describes herself as \"writer, teacher, and writing practice provocateur\", and I think this is one of her provocations, not serious criticism/critique.

She did not outline the difference in meaning (which OP requested) for a philosophical soliloquy, but for other people to use in their writing. At worst, you disagree with her, but thumbing me down on a post that has EXACT application to the question posed was improper. I gave an appropriate source and was on-topic. The OP may not be better off for my post, but you cannot argue that he is worse off for it, either.
