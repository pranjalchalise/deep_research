OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (2019-present) is a leading figure in the AI boom. By 2024, Altman had become one of the world's most renowned entrepreneurs while also serving as chairman of the clean energy companies Oklo Inc. and Helion Energy. Altman is known for his conviction that artificial general intelligence (AGI) can do anything humans can and is often compared to tech visionaries like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Formative Years On April 22, 1985, Samuel Harris Altman was born into a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Connie Gibstine, was a dermatologist, while his father, Jerry Altman, was a real estate broker. Sam Altman , the eldest of four siblings, grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. At eight, he received his first Apple Macintosh computer to learn how to code and take computer hardware apart. His education started at John Burroughs School, a private school in Ladue, Missouri. Later, in 2003, Altman enrolled at Stanford University to study computer science. He dropped out two years later at age 19, without a bachelor's degree, to work on his first startup, Loopt, a location-based social network company he co-founded. Sam Altman was a hit with Silicon Valley investors like Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital, and New Enterprise Associates, who invested more than $30 million into the idea. However, failing to acquire enough users in 2012, he sold Loopt to Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million in cash. Y Combinator (YC) In 2011, Altman became a part-time partner at startup accelerator Y Combinator (YC). Three years later, Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston, the founders of YC, asked Sam Altman to succeed Graham as president, and he accepted the offer. In 2012, Altman co-founded the venture fund Hydrazine Capital alongside his brother Jack Altman, focusing on early-stage tech investments. Under Sam Altman's leadership, Y Combinator became a premier incubator, nurturing giants like Airbnb, Instacart, and Twitch. By 2019, Altman transitioned to chairman of Y Combinator, allowing him to concentrate on OpenAI. By that time, the company had helped nearly 1,900 companies become successful. In early 2020, Sam Altman parted ways with Y Combinator amid reports of his dismissal and self-appointment as chairman. Open AI As Altman's influence in the startup world grew, he became involved in an even more ambitious project that would shape the future of artificial intelligence. In 2015, while still part of Y Combinator, Elon Musk and Peter Thiel co-founded OpenAI. The company aimed to develop friendly AI that benefited humanity and was backed by $1 billion from founders and tech giants like Microsoft . After four years of focusing primarily on research, OpenAI began to release its first products. Under Altman's leadership, in 2022, OpenAI transitioned from a non-profit to a \"capped profit\" organization and started licensing its technologies in 2020. GPT-3, released in 2020, showcased OpenAI's capabilities in natural language processing. DALL-E followed in 2021, demonstrating its ability to generate images from text. This progress led to a massive investment from Microsoft in 2023, estimated at $13 billion. OpenAI launched GPT-4 in 2023, proclaiming it \"10 times more advanced than its predecessor, GPT-3.5.\" The release of GPT-4 was a landmark event, enhancing OpenAI's reputation as a leader in AI development. This innovation was followed by further enhancements in their legacy AI model and the release of alternatives like Canvas Mini and Turbo in 2024, broadening OpenAI's offerings in AI technologies. Dismissal and return as CEO of OpenAI November 2023 brought a tumultuous time for Altman at OpenAI when the board ousted him, citing a lack of confidence in his leadership and transparency. This decision, however, met with substantial opposition from within the company. About 95 percent of OpenAI employees threatened to resign if Altman was not reinstated, highlighting the respect and admiration he commanded. This movement led to reevaluating leadership strategies and a new board featuring Bret Taylor as chair, alongside Larry Summers and Adam D'Angelo, CEO of Quora. Other Initiatives and Achievements Sam Altman's contributions span beyond AI innovation. As chairman of Helion Energy and Oklo Inc., he steers efforts towards pioneering nuclear fusion and fission technologies, reflecting his commitment to sustainable energy solutions. Helion Energy is developing a fusion reactor that could offer a limitless source of clean energy. At the same time, Oklo Inc. focuses on small modular reactors that promise more flexible and safer nuclear power options. Through his venture fund, Hydrazine Capital, co-founded with his brother, Altman has boosted startups like Airbnb and Stripe, significantly impacting technology sectors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he backed Project Covalence, enhancing the speed of clinical trials. His leadership facilitated Oklo Inc.'s successful merger with SPAC in 2024, maintaining his role as chairman. Altman's influence is recognized globally. In 2017, he received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the University of Waterloo for his support of emerging tech companies. His awards include being named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in 2023 and 2024, CEO of the Year in 2023, and featured in Businessweek's \"Best Young Entrepreneurs in Technology\" in 2008. Forbes also listed him as the top investor under 30 in 2015, underscoring his significant impact in the venture capital sphere. Sam Altman today As of 2024, Sam Altman continues to drive significant advancements in AI as the CEO of OpenAI, a role he has embraced for over five years. Under his leadership, OpenAI has flourished, reaching a staggering valuation of $300 billion following a major funding round in March 2025, led by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, placing it among the world’s most valuable private companies alongside SpaceX and ByteDance. Altman clearly articulated his vision for the future of AI in his September 2024 manifesto, \"The Intelligence Age.\" In it, he predicts the emergence of super intelligence within a few thousand days, highlighting his outlook on AI's potential to transform society. Altman, who achieved a net worth of $1.7 billion in 2025, is happily married to Oliver Mulherin, an Australian software engineer. In a notable move towards philanthropy, the couple signed the Giving Pledge in May 2024, promising to donate most of their wealth to charitable causes. Related Engineers See All Robert C.
