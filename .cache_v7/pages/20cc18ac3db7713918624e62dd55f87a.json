I bought a pair, washed it, went out crumpled like paper. I will never wear this pair of jean, such a waste of money and cotton. My older pair that was washed at the same time went out perfectly. I'm going to need to find a new brand.. September 27, 2025 Unprompted review Reply from Lee Online Store Oct 7, 2025 Dear sirs, Thank you for sharing your feedback.

Best regards, Lee Customer Care Team Updated Oct 13, 2025 Parcel never arrived, refund 1.5 month later I ordered 2 summer tops. Package was delayed 2 weeks at firtst. Then sent to wrong pickup point 30miles distance. Then cancellation was not possible. Customer needs to initiate contact al the time. After 1.5 month finally got my money back. Never received the summer tops nor had any excuse. Thanks for the late excuse Lee, but customer friendlyness does not start with an obligatory trustpilot reaction. Please really change reach out to a customer. September 21, 2025 Unprompted review Reply from Lee Online Store Oct 13, 2025 Dear sirs, Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We sincerely apologize for the delays, the inconvenience caused by the package being sent to the wrong pickup point, and the frustration you faced with the cancellation process.

May 22, 2025 Unprompted review Reply from Lee Online Store Jul 1, 2025 Dear Roel, Thank you for sharing your positive experience. It's great to hear that even when things went wrong with the shipment, our customer service stepped up and provided support and compensation. Best regards, The Lee Customer Care Team May 30, 2025 No refund and no news for 2 weeks Ordered an item on 11/5. Took them 5 days just to process my order. No email confirmation of order except shipping confirmation from Yodel on 16/5. The ordered item turned out was too big. Made the return on 19/5 and now it’s almost two weeks since I’ve returned my order. Yodel tracking shows that it was returned. No refund and AGAIN no confirmation email whatsoever. You’re never gonna know what’s going on with your order and return. Avoid at all cost.

I could not make use of my voucher due to a technical problem, after a short email conversation they solved it well. They also helped by phone later with the return art. Codes that were not clear in the return sheet. One advice to consider adjustment of the service time on the phone to most consumers shopping hours.

Within 24 hours, I'd had my first email from them asking for photos and product details and within the next 24 hours, I'd had further reply to say they had fully refunded me and given me a 20% discount code to use on my next purchase without any challenge or hassle.

The Lee Customer Care Team Feb 21, 2025 Refund I returned 2 items of clothing on two different occasions and each time I had to intervene to be refunded. I do not think Lee online shop is efficient and reliable. Thank you February 21, 2025 Unprompted review Reply from Lee Online Store May 21, 2025 Dear Marta, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We sincerely apologize for the frustrating experience you encountered with the refund process for your recent returns. We understand how inconvenient this is, and this is certainly not the efficient and reliable service we aim to provide. If this happens again in the future, and no refund has been processed within 5 business days of us receiving your return, please get in contact with our Customer Service. Best regards, The Lee Customer Care Team Dec 24, 2024 Good experience with the customer care team I like Lee jeans but I'm writing this review because the customer care team processed my issue appropriately. I reported an issue with my recently piuchased jeans (some random fraying) and after reviewing the pics they gave me a refund plus discount. Although I was expecting this I was still v happy to receive it. December 20, 2024 Unprompted review Reply from Lee Online Store Feb 12, 2025 Hi Xavier, We're so happy to hear this experience; you have brightened our day! We look forward to providing the same level each time you shop with us. Have a good day, Lee Customer Support Team Aug 23, 2024 Do not buy here! Ordered an item and got a totally different one with the same name. Does not at all resemble the one pictured on the webside. Started a refund and even it being the shop's fault, I had to pay for the return! I call that ripping people off their hard earned money! August 23, 2024 Unprompted review Advertisement Jul 22, 2024 Order from them and you'll regret losing your money You'll be lucky to receive items that even slightly resemble the pictures you saw online. Avoid them at all cost because they will provide no refund, no customer service. They also do not ship all items at once, and \"forget\" about the rest so you'll definitely lose your money there. I did my research but still fell into their traps, therefore I think all their \"good reviews\" are paid for, and the real ones hidden. I have never had a worse experience with an online clothing seller. June 1, 2024 Unprompted review Jun 25, 2024 Rude response poor customer service… Rude response poor customer service selling an item that is not what is advertised it's not the quality of the product but when your paying premium price you expect it to be correct as advertised June 25, 2024 Unprompted review Reply from Lee Online Store Aug 7, 2024 Hi Ian, Thank you for your feedback and leaving your review. I have attempted to look into your case but unfortunately I am unable to find any recent contact from your side. Please reach out to our Customer Service Team and they will be more than happy to assist you. Sorry for any inconvenience caused. Best regards, Lee Customer Care Team Jun 3, 2024 Thieves! Won't reimburse the right amount! Des voleurs ! remboursement incomplet ! (VF ci-dessous) Thieves! I bought 6 jeans at the same price, all eligible to a \"50% off of 2nd denim\" discount + an additionnal 15% welcome discount. I returned 4 of the 6 jeans, but for absolutely no reason the customer service did not reimburse me the full amount for those 4 jeans, keeping 15% of the amount they owe me and thus making me lose part of the discounts for the 2 jeans I kept (still eligible by the same discounts). They provided a calculation that is completely wrong and won't do anything about it. 6 jeans all at the same price and all with the same discounts, how hard is it to divide the total price paid by 6 and multiply the result by 4 to get the exact amount they owe their customer? Lee owes me 42,49€ and just lost a customer ! --- Des voleurs ! J'ai acheté 6 jeans tous au même prix de départ et tous en promo à \"-50% sur le 2e\" + 15% de réduction supplémentaire. J'en ai renvoyé 4, mais sans aucune raison le service client ne m'a pas remboursé le montant total correspondant à ces 4 jeans. Ils ont déduit 15% de la somme qu'ils me doivent ! Ce qui fait que j'ai perdu le bénéfices des 2 réductions pour les 2 jeans que j'ai gardés et qui restent pourtant bien éligibles aux 2 réductions. Le service client France m'a fourni un calcul complètement faux et ne veut rien savoir. Pour 6 jeans tous au même prix et avec les mêmes promotions et 4 renvoyés, c'est si dur que ça de diviser le montant total par 6 puis de multiplier le résultat par 4 pour obtenir le montant réel qu'il faut rembourser au client ?! Lee me doit 42,49€ et a perdu un client ! April 2, 2024 Unprompted review The Trustpilot Experience We're open to all Anyone can write a Trustpilot review.
