For example, Greek characters \\\\alpha, \\\\Alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\Beta, \\\\delta, \\\\Delta, \\\\epsilon . I tried enabling asciimath and using percent signs rather than dollar signs, but that just produces something differently wrong. Is the plugin broken, or is there something else I should be doing? 1 Like Upgrading Mathjax to version 4 pfaffman (Jay Pfaffman) August 11, 2025, 4:21pm 2 These work: For example, Greek characters $\\alpha, \\beta, \\delta, \\Delta, \\epsilon$. For example, Greek characters \\alpha, \\beta, \\delta, \\Delta, \\epsilon .

I’m including a screenshot of my math plugin settings below, along with a screenshot of what I put in a post and how it appears when posted… FWIW I’ve tried some other settings for the plugin, but nothing has fixed it. Am I doing something obviously wrong, or do you have any other suggestions?

Markdown shows right in preview. Moin August 11, 2025, 5:35pm 6 Does it work when you use the markdown editor instead of the rich text editor? I think @mcmcclur mentioned that math and the new rich text editor currently don’t work well together. How can i set disable Markdown &amp; Default to Rich Text used this to enforce the default Markdown editor, since the rich editor does not (yet) work well with the Discourse Math plugin. 1 Like pfaffman (Jay Pfaffman) August 11, 2025, 5:54pm 7 Not sure what I did wrong before (oh, they don’t have upper case for \\Alpha or \\Beta since “A” and “B” work), but these all seem to be working here, copied from your link with a bit of keyboard macro magic.

As you see, it’s working here. In your first example, you had double backslashes and in your second example, you’re using the visual editor (as someone else pointed out) lspector (Lee Spector) August 11, 2025, 6:33pm 8 Thanks so much everyone. It seems like the default editor was changed, which had the side effect of breaking mathjax. I no longer get the preview pane, I guess because the main pane is now supposed to be WYSIWYG, which is not something I actually want. Sadly, I don’t understand how to make this new editor go away. I see stuff at one of the links y’all provided about CSS but I don’t even know where I would put it, even if I understood it. My site is managed by discourse.org , and I don’t think I have anything local… or is there some place I can access via settings that I can put it? I’d like to banish the visual editor, get the preview pane back, and most importantly, get math formatting to work again. Is there a straightforward way for me to do this? pfaffman (Jay Pfaffman) August 11, 2025, 6:37pm 9 lspector: Is there a straightforward way for me to do this? @moin linked to it in the post before mine. Moin August 11, 2025, 6:43pm 10 You can change the Default composition mode site setting to markdown. And then if you are not using the starter plan, you can use the CSS from the post I linked in a theme component to hide the toggle in the composer. ( Customizing themes without an Edit code button ) How can i set disable Markdown &amp; Default to Rich Text Then, add a little CSS snippet to the code for that component that looks like so: .composer-toggle-switch { display: none; 1 Like lspector (Lee Spector) August 11, 2025, 7:02pm 11 I’m trying to do this but it’s not working. I created a new component with the code: .composer-toggle-switch { display: none; } I don’t know if I need to do something else to make it active, but after doing this I still get the WYSIWYG editor, I don’t see anything to toggle that off (what would that look like, and where would I find it?), and the math in all of my previous posts is still broken. I have to admit that I don’t actually know what a component is, I never do anything with CSS, etc. So I’m pretty clueless, sadly. But I would really like to get the math working on my site again. Suggestions? mcmcclur (Mark McClure) August 11, 2025, 7:24pm 12 lspector: I created a new component with the code: .composer-toggle-switch { display: none; } Assuming that you put that in the correct place and enabled the component, that should hide the switch that allows you to change back and forth from the rich editor to the Markdown editor. In particular, the switch that I’ve circled that in this image of the left side of the editor should be gone: You still need to change the Default Composition Mode in the site preferences. You should just be able to search for it. 1 Like Moin August 11, 2025, 7:47pm 13 lspector: I’m trying to do this but it’s not working. Have you done this? Moin: You can change the Default composition mode site setting to markdown. lspector (Lee Spector) August 11, 2025, 9:33pm 14 Thank you everyone for your patience on this I had previously tried to change the default composition mode but didn’t find the setting – total failure on my part to be sure, in searching the settings. Anyway, I’ve now found it, and changed it, and I’m getting the markdown editor with preview again, which is awesome. Even better, now my math works! FWIW I didn’t know what the toggle looked like or where to find it, so I didn’t know how to switch it manually. Thanks @mcmcclur especially for that screenshot. On the component, I think it is enabled, but for some reason not working, but now I’m not even sure it matters much to me. Am I right that this is just for hiding the mode toggle? I’m not sure I actually care whether or not people can toggle the mode, as long as it’s possible to make the math work, and especially since it will work in the default mode. 3 Likes mcmcclur (Mark McClure) August 11, 2025, 9:37pm 15 lspector: Am I right that this is just for hiding the mode toggle? Yes, that’s exactly correct. I described here why that matters to me but it’s arguably more natural to let the user decide in most cases. 2 Likes lspector (Lee Spector) August 11, 2025, 9:42pm 16 Thanks again to everyone here – you’ve been super helpful and I really appreciate it. 1 Like lspector (Lee Spector) August 11, 2025, 9:50pm 17 PS I figured out why the toggle wasn’t being hidden. The component was not set to apply to the correct theme. Now I can hide it, and I’ll figure out whether or not I really want to.
