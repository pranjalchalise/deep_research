Chen Biomedical Technology • Volume 12 • December 2025 View PDF View abstract View details in Scopus 1 citation CD4 + T cells play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, recognizing peptide antigens presented by MHC II molecules during infections and tumor development. Identifying immunodominant MHC II epitopess is essential for understanding CD4 + T cell responses; however, current methods such as mass spectrometry, suffer from low sensitivity and throughput, while computational algorithms show variable accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we developed EliteMHCII, a high-throughput immunopeptidome profiling platform that identifies antigen-derived MHC II epitopes and measures peptide binding affinity across 24 globally common MHC II alleles. Using EliteMHCII, we assessed the immunodominant epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein. Validation in vaccinated individuals and humanized mouse models revealed a strong correlation between high-affinity peptides and robust CD4 + T cell responses, while low-affinity peptides failed to elicit responses. Therefore, our immunopeptidome profiling platform, EliteMHCII, serves as a rapid, high throughput, feasible platform for CD4 + T cell epitope discovery at a global populational level in the context of infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy.

Fu, … H. Dong, … T. Si ACS Synthetic Biology • • Available online 12 November 2024 View abstract The success of AlphaFold in protein structure prediction highlights the power of data-driven approaches in scientific research. However, developing machine learning models to design and engineer proteins with desirable functions is hampered by limited access to high-quality data sets and experimental feedback. The Critical Assessment of Protein Engineering (CAPE) challenge addresses these issues through a student-focused competition, utilizing cloud computing and biofoundries to lower barriers to entry. CAPE serves as an open platform for community learning, where mutant data sets and design algorithms from past contestants help improve overall performance in subsequent rounds. Through two competition rounds, student participants collectively designed >1500 new mutant sequences, with the best-performing variants exhibiting catalytic activity up to 5-fold higher than the wild-type parent. We envision CAPE as a collaborative platform to engage young researchers and promote computational protein engineering. Short communication Abstract only Synergistic regulation of intermolecular interactions to control chiral structures for chiral recognition W. Chen, … H. Dong, … X. Fan Chinese Chemical Letters • Volume 34, Issue 3 • March 2023 View abstract Understanding the regulatory mechanism of self-assembly processes is a necessity to modulate nanostructures and their properties. Herein, we have studied the mechanism of self-assembly in the C3 symmetric 1,3,5-benzentricarboxylic amino acid methyl ester enantiomers (TPE) in a mixed solvent system consisting of methanol and water. The resultant chiral structure was used for chiral recognition. The formation of chiral structures from the synergistic effect of multiple noncovalent interaction forces was confirmed by various techniques. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to characterize the time evolution of TPE structure and properties in solution. The theoretical results were consistent with the experimental results. Furthermore, the chiral structure assembled by the building blocks of TPE molecules was highly stereoselective for diamine compounds.

Research article Abstract only An electrostatic-variable coarse-grained model for predicting enthalpy of vaporization, surface tension, diffusivity, conductivity, and dielectric constant of aqueous ionic liquid Y. Ge, … H. Dong, J. Ma Journal of Molecular Liquids • Volume 346 • 15 January 2022 View abstract An electrostatic-variable coarse-grained model is proposed for aqueous ILs. Inter-ion charge transfer is considered by DFT calculation of a 30-pair ILs cluster. A water-content-dependent dielectric constant handles variable polarization effect. Our model well reproduces experimental results of thermodynamics, dynamic properties. Electrostatics polarization effects are crucial in predicting various physical properties of pure or aqueous ionic liquids, which have potential applications as green solvents in many fields, such as chemical synthesis and gas separations. Here, we proposed an electrostatic-variable coarse-grained (VaCG) model to predict physical properties of water/[BMIM] + [BF 4 ] - binary mixtures and pure [BMIM] + [SCN] - by introducing a concentration or environment-dependent dielectric constant of ionic liquid, ε IL ( x ), and water, ε w ( x ), in the non-bonded electrostatic interaction term, respectively. The electrostatic polarization induced charge transfer between cation and anion pair of ionic liquid was treated by setting the fragment charges of the three coarse-grained beads, i.e., butyl and methylimidazolium units of [BMIM] + and anions ([BF 4 ] - or [SCN] - ), from the linear scaling generalized energy-based fragmentation electronic structure calculations of clusters with up to 30 cation–anion pairs. This model handles the polarization effect over the range of water mole fraction x = 0 ∼ 100 mol% with the explicit partial charges and implicit treatment of the long-ranged continuum medium without increasing the computational cost. The VaCG model has good performance in predicting thermodynamics (density, enthalpy of vaporization, surface tension), dynamic properties (diffusivity, ionic conductivity), and dielectric properties of aqueous solutions. This model is expected to be applicable to many other complicated systems with significant polarization effects. Research article Abstract only Two-dimensional Mo-based compounds for the Li-O 2 batteries: Catalytic performance and electronic structure studies X. Mu, … H. Dong, … H. Zhou Energy Storage Materials • Volume 41 • October 2021 View abstract Rechargeable Li-O 2 batteries have captured increasing attention owing to their ultra-high theoretical specific energy. However, this promising system is confronted with the large overpotential, limited discharge capacity and low cyclic life. Herein, three two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum-based compounds of MoN, MoO 3 and MoS 2 are used as cathode catalysts in Li-O 2 batteries. The catalytic performance and electronic structures of these catalysts are compared comprehensively. Electrochemical test results reveal the superior battery performance of MoN cathodes, which deliver the highest specific discharge capacity of approximately 7400 mAh g − 1 and the lowest discharge/charge overpotential of 0.19/0.72 V. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the metallic property of MoN whereas MoO 3 and MoS 2 are poor conductive. Besides, interface properties between MoN and Li 2 O 2 products as well as reaction pathways of the Li-O 2 battery with MoN cathode are also investigated detailedly by DFT calculations, explaining the excellent catalytic properties of MoN at the atomic level. The present work provides intrinsic insights into designing high-performance cathode catalysts for Li-O 2 batteries with fine-tuned morphology and electronic characteristics. Research article Open access Toward a Model for Activation of Orai Channel H. Dong, … M.L. Klein Iscience • Volume 16 • 28 June 2019 View PDF View abstract Store-operated calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels mediate a variety of cellular signaling functions. The CRAC channel pore-forming protein, Orai1, is a hexamer arranged with 3-fold symmetry. Despite its importance in moving Ca 2+ ions into cells, a detailed mechanistic understanding of Orai1 activation is lacking. Herein, a working model is proposed for the putative open state of Orai from Drosophila melanogaster (dOrai), which involves a “twist-to-open” gating mechanism. The proposed model is supported by energetic, structural, and experimental evidence. Fluorescent imaging demonstrates that each subunit on the intracellular side of the pore is inherently strongly cross-linked, which is important for coupling to STIM1, the pore activator, and graded activation of the Orai1 channel. The proposed model thus paves the way for understanding key aspects of calcium signaling at a molecular level. Mechanical coupling within the calcium channel pore is critical for its activation Molecular modeling could disclose gating mechanism of ion channels at atomic level The predicted open-state structure of the pore was further confirmed by experiments Biological Sciences; Molecular Biology; Structural Biology Research article Abstract only Reduction of isoxazoles including sulfamethoxazole by aqueous Fe II –tiron complex: Impact of structures Y. Chen, H. Dong, H. Zhang Chemical Engineering Journal • Volume 352 • 15 November 2018 View abstract Reduction of isoxazoles, such as sulfamethoxazole, by soluble Fe II –tiron complex was studied. Reduction products of the isoxazoles were mainly ring-cleavage analogs. The types of complexes formed between isoxazoles and Fe II –tiron largely determined the reaction kinetics. Electron transfer was found to be the rate-limiting step. Isoxazole (ISX) is a key moiety in a number of antibiotics and pesticides such as sulfamethoxazole. Various ISXs were found to be reduced at different rates in aqueous solution containing Fe II and tiron (a catecholate ligand), and the reduction products were identified by time-of-flight mass spectrometry to be the ring-cleavage analogs. Three types of complexes were found to likely form between ISXs and Fe II –tiron species: type I forms through 3-N and ring-O; type II forms through 5-N/O and ring-N; and type III forms through 6-O and ring-N. Calculation results indicate that electron transfer (either 1st or 2nd), not protonation or N–O bond dissociation, is most likely the rate-limiting step. Because of the much lower free energies of the complexes formed after ring cleavage than before ring cleavage, the complexation should occur either after or during ring cleavage. The solvent kinetic isotope effects for the reduction of 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole (AMX) and 3,5-dimethylisoxazole (DMX) were determined to be 1.992 ± 0.068 and 1.209 ± 0.079, respectively, indicating that a proton is likely involved in the rate-limiting step for AMX but not for DMX. Electrochemical cell experiments demonstrated that the electron transfer can be significantly facilitated by type I and type II complexation with 1:2 Fe II –tiron complex, but only to some extent with free Fe II . This study provided a promising strategy to apply a highly effective and low cost reductant for the removal of emerging contaminants from anoxic environments. Research article Abstract only THz spectra and corresponding vibrational modes of DNA base pair cocrystals and polynucleotides F. Wang, … H. Dong, … S. Li Spectrochimica Acta Part A Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy • Volume 200 • 5 July 2018 View abstract The generalized energy-based fragmentation (GEBF) approach has been applied to study the THz spectra and vibrational modes of base pair cocrystals under periodic boundary conditions (denoted as PBC-GEBF). Results of vibrational mode reveal that hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in the pairing process of base crystals, where most N H and C H bonds stretch to some extent. We also found that hydrogen bonds of a self-made A:T cocrystal completely break in a transition from liquid to the solid state, while self-made C:G cocrystal is different and easier to form a cocrystal, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and terahertz (THz) spectra. Furthermore, we have studied DNA polynucleotides (in both A and B forms) found that the vibrational modes changed a lot during the process of their forming double strand. Despite the key role played by hydrogen bonds, the key contribution originates from collective motions of the main skeleton. A comparative study of the spectra of some stranded fragments suggests that different sequences or forms have similar spectra in THz band. They distinguish from each other mainly in the low-frequency regions, especially below 1 THz. This study would make great contributions to the molecular dynamics model based DNA long-chain structure simulation in the future study. From DNA base pair cocrystals to DNA characteristic double helix fragment. PBC-GEBF method adopted by us is employed to calculate the vibrational spectra of the DNA base pair cocrystals. Some absorption peaks of base pair cocrystals were first reported here in the vicinity of 1-9 THz. Compared to A:T, the hydrogen bonds of C:G is less likely to break during their formation to cocrystal. DNA fragments with different sequences or forms have similar spectra in THz band (1-10THz). Different DNA sequences distinguish from each other mainly in Sub-THz regions (0.1-1THz). Research article Abstract only Terahertz spectra of DNA nucleobase crystals: A joint experimental and computational study F. Wang, … H. Dong, … S. Li Spectrochimica Acta Part A Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy • Volume 179 • 15 May 2017 View abstract Terahertz (THz) spectra of DNA nucleobase crystals were experimentally studied by terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and computationally studied by the generalized energy-based fragmentation approach under periodic boundary conditions (denoted as PBC-GEBF). We analyzed the vibrational spectra of solid-state DNA nucleobases and assigned the corresponding vibrational modes to the main peaks in the experimental spectra with the PBC-GEBF results. The computational results were verified to be in good accordance with the experimental data. Harmonic vibrational frequency results revealed that all the vibrational modes belong to collective vibrational modes, which involve complicated mixtures of inter- and intramolecular displacements, somewhere in the vicinity of 0.5–9 THz. From the crystal structure to the vibration spectrum and the corresponding vibration modes. PBC-GEBF method developed by us is first time employed to calculate the vibrational spectra of the DNA nucleobase crystals. Normal modes are obtained to illustrate the vibrational modes. Some absorption peaks of crystals were first reported here in the vicinity of 0.5–9 THz. All the vibrational modes of DNA nucleobase crystals belong to collective vibrational modes in THz range. Review article Abstract only Size matters in activation/inhibition of ligand-gated ion channels J. Du, H. Dong, H.X. Zhou Trends in Pharmacological Sciences • Volume 33, Issue 9 • September 2012 View abstract Cys loop, glutamate, and P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) with 5, 4, and 3 protomers, respectively. There is now growing atomic level understanding of their gating mechanisms. Although each family is unique in the architecture of the ligand-binding pocket, the pathway for motions to propagate from ligand-binding domain to transmembrane domain, and the gating motions of the transmembrane domain, there are common features among the LGICs, which are the focus of the present review. In particular, agonists and competitive antagonists apparently induce opposite motions of the binding pocket. A simple way to control the motional direction is ligand size. Agonists, usually small, induce closure of the binding pocket, leading to opening of the channel pore, whereas antagonists, usually large, induce opening of the binding pocket, thereby stabilizing the closed pore. A cross-family comparison of the gating mechanisms of the LGICs, focusing in particular on the role played by ligand size, provides new insight on channel activation/inhibition and design of pharmacological compounds. Review article Abstract only M2 protein from Influenza A: from multiple structures to biophysical and functional insights T.A. Cross, H. Dong, … H.X. Zhou Current Opinion in Virology • Volume 2, Issue 2 • April 2012 View abstract ► Characterization of M2 in lipid bilayers has revealed a native-like structure. ► The tetrameric M2 structure is a dimer of dimer conformation in the +2 charged state. ► The functionally significant amantadine and rimantadine binding sites is in the pore. ► The M2 structure from influenza A is sensitive to its membrane mimetic environment. ► A mathematical model for M2 H + transport is consistent with much conductance data. The M2 protein from influenza A is a proton channel as a tetramer, with a single transmembrane helix from each monomer lining the pore. Val27 and Trp41 form gates at either end of the pore and His37 mediates the shuttling of protons across a central barrier between the N-terminal and C-terminal aqueous pore regions. Numerous structures of this transmembrane domain and of a longer construct that includes an amphipathic helix are now in the Protein Data Bank. Many structural differences are apparent from samples obtained in a variety of membrane mimetic environments. High-resolution structural results in lipid bilayers have provided novel insights into the functional mechanism of the unique HxxxW cluster in the M2 proton channel.
