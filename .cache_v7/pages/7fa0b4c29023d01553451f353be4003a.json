I would take this opportunity to pretend to be a film critic and shower praise on one of India’s digital and modern age icons. Jitu has been a part of our favourite shows in the last decade, always managing to steal the spotlight despite being picked for supporting roles. I feel that his life is similar to Sushant’s and highlights the talent and dreams of every individual trying to succeed in the film industry. How they must succeed in real to get an opportunity at reel. https://www.filmcompanion.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Film_companion_TVF-Kota-Factory-Lead-Image-5.jpg Jitendra is the quintessential Indian, someone who looks like us and has gone through the rigours of Indian society. He succeeded at getting an admission into IIT Kharagpur for Civil Engineering, going through the Kota education system. I am certain he is no stranger to hardwork or have things come easy. Hailing from a small town Khairthal in Rajasthan, he has come a long way to stand out as a true icon of a developing India. I don’t suppose in the past people would have really imagined that a skinny, short and dark kid could have captured our minds as a hero the way Jitu Bhaiya has. He is not your conventional Indian hero, the overreaching romantic, unnecessarily tough guy or just a brooding jawline; he makes his presence effortless on screen, defining the Indian boy next door. He appears courteous and approachable, fun and relatable that after every scene you’re left waiting/wanting for more, somehow always managing to outshine with every new performance. His success has been one of the key indicators to showcase that the audience is changing, they are looking for content and talent driven work and not cinema where we are left justifying or rationalising to ourselves why do we love this nepotistic star/product in the first place. HIGHLIGHTS Moving on to talk about his performances. I have not seen all his work honestly, but the ones I have I will share my thoughts on and tell you why I love them. 1. Abhishek Tripathi in Panchayat One of the reasons why Panchayat resonated with every Indian was the characters and casting. A simple story told in a beautiful maner, Jitu Bhaiya as Abhishek Tripathi manages to successfully hold his own in the presence of veterans like Raghubir Yadav and Neena Gupta. He is central to the plot moving forward, as he struggles with his MBA aspirations and chance at a better life. Abhishek experiences the vagaries of rural India, he is struck by most situations and is ably supported by his assistant Vikas (Chandan Roy), Pradhan ji (Raghubir Yadav), Deputy Pradhan (Faisal Malik) and Manju Devi (Neena Gupta) . It is a light-hearted tale of the struggles most of our country experiences daily. Struggling with the future and its uncertainties and the small wins, we must take to keep us going. There are scenes that highlight his ability and ability to show a range of emotions with restraint; like frustration, surprise, anger, happiness, downcast and the hinted romance on meeting Rinky . The manner and expressions when he called the groom an asshole or vented his anger at the boys in the field, I think all of us have acting out at times in the exact same manner despite being mild mannered and docile otherwise purely due to our frustrations. 2. Jitu Bhaiya in Kota Factory Ranjan Raj as Meena described his performance perfectly in, ‘ Bilkul, fan ban ne layak hain woh aadmi’. I think he captured the role seamlessly as not just the perfect teacher but a true guide and mentor to his students and anyone who cared to watch. He left us thinking of our choices and thoughts in life, and this is the most powerful ability an actor can have. I thoroughly enjoyed him on screen here despite meatier roles in other shows, he was empathetic and supportive, guiding his students and the audience with their problems. Being a student of science, didn’t follow through, would have loved a similar presence in my life through those years. There is something to learn and be inspired from his monologues when he tells his students to jostle with their problems (Dhunn do), it is everything that an Ananya Pandey will never learn. The ability to persevere. 3. Aman Tripathi in Shubh Mangal Zyaada Savdhaan Okay, I am rating this above Pitchers (it’s not) but since it is his first commercial movie it deserves a special mention as he stole the spotlight from Ayushmann Khurana. I think every character in the movie was outstanding, outshining even the script whether it was the Neena Gupta-Gajraj Rao duo, Manvi Gagroo as Goggle or Manu Rishi . The acting carried the script beyond its actual depth and Jitu as the demure Aman, was perfectly balancing Ayushmanns over the top flag bearer character. His humour was dry and a hoot; he links up wonderfully with the veteran Gajraj Rao and makes the screen thoroughly enjoyable. Further, there are a few more shows that deserve a special mention and a small recap to Jitu’s characters. https://preview.redd.it/xl2abrwmava51.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c502d76542f0104b7af5637d0ce8d6ca8d8f171 Jitu in Pitchers : Jitu copes with different facets of life, his marriage with Akanksha Thakur as his wife defines modern Indian couples, who manage their professional talents and innovations with orthodoxy in their roots. An overbearing father dominates his life as an adult and decisions, and he struggles to let his talent breakout. Pathik/Gittu in Permanent Roommates : Sumeet Vyas is a legend but Jitu just pulled the entire episode to himself, as he shares his fears of intimacy and marriage. His responses and delivery leaves the audience and the cast astounded alike. Daaru pe Charcha as himself: Hilarious, to sum it up Mooh main lo bhai, Mooh Main lo . Barely Speaking with Arnub as Arjun Kejriwal: I’m sure Arvind Kejriwal would have gone back, evaluating his own choices and mannerisms after seeing himself represented so accurately. I think every dialogue by Jitu can be turned into a meme, if you don’t believe me try it. He’s a gem just in terms of range, relatability and enjoyability on screen. I end this with a few brilliant monologues/scenes of Jitu. 17 ka hai yeh bkl 1. ‘ Gunday nahi hain Entrepreneurs hain Bhenchod ’: TVF Pitchers as he tears into the 17 year old kid stealing their idea and ambitions. Damn this was gangster https://preview.redd.it/p0vyoumz9va51.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79c71fcfc6ab12b7446320f788cbaf469c01708 2. ‘ Saat saal lagte hain iss do saal ke sadme se nikalne ke liye ’: Kota Factory as the student favorite Jitu Bhaiya tries to teach a young Vaibhav to be certain of his decision to pursue IIT and be honest about his ambitions. Hardwork does pay off and people like him our true geniuses who win despite our social systems like Sushant . They have come from small towns and cities, having excelled academically they are now building their name under the sun, through sheer brilliance. It is time that the Raj, Rahul and Prems move over we got Jitu and Naveens taking over. Please do reach out to Jitu at his channels and try to tag him to this post we would love for him to share this on his twitter and other channels as they can’t manage the bullshit fan clubs made up by PR. They can hence only rely on pure talent and true love. Trivia: Jitu graduated from a Hindi medium school and also gave the IITJEE exam in Hindi He was picked for the Dramatics society at IIT-KGP by seniors during a hazing session for freshers Biswapati Sarkar , a senior asked Jitu to come to Bombay and hired him at TVF after working together at IIT-KGP’s Hindi Dramatics society. A Trailer to Pitchers Season 2 though the actual season is still not out. Jitu is 5 feet 5 inches(as per quora), relatively short I guess. BE LIKE JITU!
