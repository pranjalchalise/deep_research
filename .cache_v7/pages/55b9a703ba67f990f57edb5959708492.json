I chose Amherst! Hi everyone, i'm a high school senior and recently got into both the Amherst and Williams fly-in programs, but they're happening at the same time so I have to choose between them. I've done research and am leaning more towards Amherst, but I have a few questions about the school in general: What is The Amherst Student newspaper's reputation on campus-- is it well-known? A quality publication that students actually care about/pay attention to, at least somewhat? (i'm interested in journalism) How is the food at Valentine? Is it true that there's a prominent athlete-nonathlete divide? Like do athletic teams basically function as sororities/fraternities on campus? (follow-up to previous Q:) Is it just the varsity athletes that have that \"dominating\", frat-like reputation on campus or club sport athletes too? Is the college town nearby easily accessible? Do students regularly just go and explore little shops and stuff? For alumni: Do alumni connections extend pretty diversely throughout the US or are they mostly concentrated in MA/New England?(asking as someone from CA where just some ppl know abt Amherst) Any pros/cons about Amherst that not enough people talk about? If anyone could help answer any of these questions at all, that would be so helpful!! Thank you!! Read more Share"
