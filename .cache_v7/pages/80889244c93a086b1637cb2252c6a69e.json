Britannica Editors Last updated Dec. 13, 2025 • History Britannica AI Ask Anything Quick Summary Table of Contents Table of Contents Quick Summary Ask Anything John Smith (baptized January 6, 1580, Willoughby, Lincolnshire , England—died June 21, 1631, London) was an English explorer and early leader of the Jamestown Colony , the first permanent English settlement in North America . Smith played an equally important role as a cartographer and a prolific writer who vividly depicted the natural abundance of the New World, whetting the colonizing appetite of prospective English settlers. Smith grew up on his family’s farm and was apprenticed in his teens to a wealthy merchant. At age 16 or 17 his adventuresome spirit found an outlet on the battlefields of continental Europe, where he fought for the Netherlands in its war of independence from Spain. Having returned to England by 1599, he spent about two years reading classical military texts and studying horsemanship. He then traveled to Hungary in 1601 as a mercenary to join Austrian forces fighting the Ottoman Empire; he advanced to the rank of captain. Captured by the enemy the following year and taken to Turkey, he escaped to Russia and returned to England in 1604 or 1605. He then attached himself to a group preparing to establish an English colony in North America. When a royal charter was granted to the Virginia Company of London , Smith and about 100 other colonists led by Christopher Newport set sail on December 20, 1606. On April 26, 1607, the voyagers arrived at the Chesapeake Bay , and on May 14 they disembarked at what was to become Jamestown. The Virginia Company had named Smith to the colony’s seven-member governing council. His relationship with the colony’s other leaders was generally antagonistic , his focus being on the practical means of survival in the wilderness rather than on personal privileges and status. He traded for corn (maize) with the local Indians and began a series of river voyages that later enabled him to draw a remarkably accurate map of Virginia . While exploring the Chickahominy River in December 1607, he and his party were ambushed by members of the Powhatan empire, which dominated the region. He was ultimately taken to their emperor, Chief Powhatan , also known as Wahunsenacah. According to Smith’s account, he was about to be put to death when he was saved by the chief’s young daughter of age 10 or 11, Pocahontas , who placed herself between him and his executioners.

He conducted military training and continued to secure corn from the Indians by trade. He required greater discipline of the colonists, announcing a policy that \"he that will not worke shall not eate (except by sicknesse he be disabled).\" Colonists had previously been fed from a common storehouse whether they worked or not. Under Smith’s direction, small quantities of tar, pitch, and soap ash were made, a well was dug, houses were built, fishing was done regularly, crops were planted, and outlying forts were built. The colony bore little loss of life during his presidency, compared with the enormous suffering and mortality of the years before and after his rule. In his dealings with Native Americans, Smith’s approach differed from those of the Spanish conquistadores and later English settlers. Smith chose to keep the Powhatan empire at bay through psychology, diplomacy, and intimidation—not massacre. He believed the English could avoid bloodshed by projecting an image of strength. When Smith was injured from a fire in his powder bag in September 1609, he was forced to return to England. Still eager to explore and settle in America, Smith made contact with the Plymouth Company and sailed in 1614 to the area he named New England , carefully mapping the coast from Penobscot Bay to Cape Cod . On another exploratory voyage the following year, he was captured by pirates and returned to England after escaping three months later. In 1617 he made one final colonizing attempt, but his vessels were unable to leave port for three months for lack of winds, and he never set sail. Smith advocated English settlement of New England for the rest of his life, but he never saw North America again. His writings included detailed descriptions of Virginia and New England, books on seamanship, and a history of English colonization. Among his books were A Description of New England (1616), a counterpart to his Map of Virginia with a Description of the Country (1612); The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England, and the Summer Isles (1624); and The True Travels, Adventures, and Observations of Captain John Smith in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America (1630). The Mayflower colonists of 1620 brought his books and maps with them to Massachusetts. Smith died of an unrecorded illness midway through 1631, at age 51, in the London home of Sir Samuel Saltonstall, a friend. During the founding years of the United States in the late 18th and the early 19th century, Smith was widely regarded as a reliable observer as well as a national hero. Thomas Jefferson described him as \"honest, sensible, and well informed.\" Some historians have contended that Smith was prone to self-promotion in his writings. Yet his writings are notably generous in giving credit to others who helped the colony survive, and scholars have confirmed factual details of his autobiographical writing.

Some scholars believe he might have misunderstood the event—that it could have been an adoption ceremony rather than an intended execution—and others contend that he fabricated the incident outright. With regard to the truthfulness of Smith’s account, it has been argued that he had little reason to concoct such an episode. Because Smith was the only English eyewitness to the incident and the Powhatan witnesses left no written record, the debate over it may never be conclusively resolved.
