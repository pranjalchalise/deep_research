  "data": "Lee Health Invites the Community to Join its Healthcare Insights Panel From Dr. Larry Antonucci, Lee Health's President and Chief Executive Officer Lee Health has been our community’s major destination for healthcare for more than 105 years. We have always wanted and strived to listen to our community and respond appropriately, evolving to meet the changing healthcare needs of Southwest Florida. We are excited for a new opportunity to listen through the Healthcare Insights Panel; and we are looking for members of our community (18 years of age and older) willing to participate by providing feedback and personal insights to help Lee Health improve. Your participation in the Healthcare Insights Panel allows you to provide input on topics that are relevant to you through occasional surveys or interviews. If you choose to participate, you may be asked to: Provide feedback about your experiences and healthcare needs; Help evaluate existing programs and patient or staff materials; Share your input on new Lee Health services, programs; or Offer insight into planning for new facilities. If you decide to be a member of Lee Health’s Healthcare Insights Panel, you can expect to receive invitations to participate in online surveys about our health system every month or two. The surveys may vary in length but will generally take about 15 minutes (or less) to complete. Your responses are confidential and will not be connected with your name or other identifying information. In addition to the survey and interviews, there may be opportunities to participate in longer studies, for which members generally receive payment for service. As a member of the Healthcare Insights Panel, you will receive regular updates highlighting contributions that have helped transform healthcare delivery – something that we hope will instill significant pride in all of the panel members. The panel is managed by an expert, third-party research firm called Market Street Research. We invite you to visit their website to learn more about them – www.marketstreetresearch.com . Your voice and valuable feedback, insights and recommendations are very important to us at Lee Health. We hope you will consider helping us make healthcare even better by joining the panel. To learn more about this opportunity, go to www.LeeHealth.org and look for the blue “Healthcare Insights Panel” banner toward the middle of the website’s homepage. We want to hear from you so we can continue to evolve our health system to ensure our community receives the highest quality, compassionate, leading-edge healthcare it deserves and has come to expect from Lee Health."
