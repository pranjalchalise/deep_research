The population of BPRs from 2019 to 2020 was 1,403 by using the purposive sampling method which obtained 29 BPR samples. This study uses the MRA analysis model and Eviews. The empirical findings conclude that customer satisfaction has a significant positive effect on financial performance, while media reputation and digital banking have no impact on financial performance.
