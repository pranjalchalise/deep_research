So I was watching the Friends Per Second Podcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2cphQKh3dw and Pearce was a guest and I noticed a big amount of hate comments for that fact. There were many claims of being fraudulent, stealing stuff and generally lying. The problem for me is that I'm really unsure what exactly is true or if it's a hate train thing that got influenced by youtube content grifters. Or if there is some truth but also stuff that just gets added on even if it's not true because it's easy to do with hated individuals or truth getting exaggerated from something that doesn't really matter. I personally don't care for Pearce since her videos are not my style and I disagree to much on some stuff, but I was a bit surprised since I thought she was pretty well liked. Many comments seemed to act like that was widely known so I thought it made sense to ask here. Read more Share"
