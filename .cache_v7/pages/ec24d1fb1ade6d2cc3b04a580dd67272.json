After going through the recruiting process myself, here's my advice for what you should be dong each year to give yourself the best chance at getting recruited to play for a college team. Freshman year: Take a challenging courseload and get good grades in all of your classes. This year provides the foundation for your GPA and class rank, so make sure you get off to a good start. Work as hard as you can to improve your ranking/rating in your sport, because you will have the most time this year to focus on your sport. Start researching a few colleges you would like to play for and make a list of your top choices so that you have a goal to work towards. Don't get caught up in the recruiting process just yet, focus on improving your performance in your sport and perform well academically to give yourself the best chance in future years. Sophomore year: Continue taking a challenging courseload and get good grades in your classes. This is the year where some college coaches will begin to scout you and look at your records to see if they can recruit you. Start thinking about SAT/ACT preparation and have a game plan to do well on whichever test you choose. Expand on your college list and continue working hard towards your goals and the schools you want to get recruited at. Research and figure out which division you would like to play for. There are 3 divisions within the NCAA, each of them offer different experiences. I have compared each division below in the chart: (scroll left on the chart to see division II and division III) Division I Division II Division III Athletic scholarships are available. Please note Ivy League schools are D1, but cannot offer athletic scholarships. Some athletic scholarships are available No athletic scholarships, only academic scholarships and need-based financial aid. D1 Practices last ~20 hrs/week Practice ~16 hrs/week Practice ~12 to 14 hrs/week Much leeway is given to recruited athletes depending on the school, but still do well in your classes to make sure you can even get some academic scholarships if they allow you to stack athletic and academic scholarships. Some leeway is given to recruited athletes, but you are held to a certain standard academically. Almost no leeway is given to recruited athletes. You still must meet very high academic standards to be admitted despite being a recruited athlete. Examples include state flagship schools, Stanford, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, Georgetown, USC, Georgia Tech Examples include Point Loma, St. Edwards, Adelphi, Cal States, Young Harris, Wayne State Examples include MIT, Caltech, Pomona, Johns Hopkins, Case Western, Emory, Amherst, UChicago, Carnegie Mellon, Tufts, Middlebury Junior Year: Your junior year grades matter the most for admissions, so do your best in all of your classes and take challenging courses. Take the SAT/ACT and ask the college coaches an estimate of what score they expect. Many strong academic D3 schools such as MIT, Caltech, and Johns Hopkins will ask for a SAT score of around 1500 or higher, so prepare well. Start contacting the coaches of schools you are interested in. Division I coaches can be contacted starting June 15th or September 1st of your junior year depending on the sport. Think about which teachers you would like to ask for a letter of recommendation. Keep communicating with the coaches you are interested in and express your interest in being a part of their sports program. You can reach out to coaches through email or text if you would like. Senior year: Most coaches will ask for your academic stats in the fall to send to admissions for an \"academic pre-read,\" where an admissions officer will look at your stats and determine if you will be admitted. Continue comparing your options and coaches will invite you for a visit if they would like in the summer or fall. If a coach invites you for a visit, then it means they are interested in you. Keep doing well in your classes and retake the SAT/ACT for a higher score if needed If you are given a positive academic pre-read and a coach offers you a spot on the team, you may then commit and send your application for early decision/early action. Congrats on your commitment! Enjoy the next 4 years as a student-athlete This is just my advice on the things you should do each year to get recruited to the best schools possible. Please let me know if I should add anything. Read more Share"
