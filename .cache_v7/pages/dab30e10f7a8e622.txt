- DATE: - AUTHOR: - The LangChain Team 🐍 Performance enhancements & CI benchmarks for LangGraph Python library We've shipped a number of updates to the LangGraph Python library! These include the following: Performance Enhancements: We've made significant improvements to streamline processing and reduce overhead, enhancing overall performance while ensuring backwards compatibility. Reduced redundant calls to langchain.load.dumps for the same object and objects that don't benefit from it.Replaced JSON serialization with MsgPack using custom extension types, improving speed and efficiency. Avoided unnecessary object copies in dicts, lists, and checkpoints unless strictly required. Switched BaseChannel and all subclasses to useslots , optimizing memory usage. Code Optimization & Simplification: Our focus was on removing inefficiencies and simplifying workflows for faster execution. Eliminated the creation of new CallbackManager instances when an existing one is available.Re-implemented langchain_core.runnables.ensure_config andmerge_configs to avoid unnecessary calls.Simplified checkpoint and task ID generation using pseudo-random numbers instead of cryptographically secure bytes. CI Benchmarks & Caching Improvements: To maintain high performance, we've introduced CI benchmarks and improved caching mechanisms. Added performance benchmarks running on CI to track and maintain improvements. Cached function signature checks in RunnableCallable , reducing unnecessary lookups.Avoided dynamic ChannelWrite runnable creation in conditional edges, improving execution flow. These updates collectively enhance LangGraph’s performance and reliability, making it faster and more efficient for users.
