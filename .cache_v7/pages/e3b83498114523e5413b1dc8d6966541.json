Context can be characterized along two key dimensions: By mutability : Static context : Immutable data that doesn’t change during execution (e.g., user metadata, database connections, tools) Dynamic context : Mutable data that evolves as the application runs (e.g., conversation history, intermediate results, tool call observations) By lifetime : Runtime context : Data scoped to a single run or invocation Cross-conversation context : Data that persists across multiple conversations or sessions Runtime context refers to local context: data and dependencies your code needs to run. It does not refer to: The LLM context, which is the data passed into the LLM’s prompt. The “context window”, which is the maximum number of tokens that can be passed to the LLM. Runtime context is a form of dependency injection and can be used to optimize the LLM context. It lets to provide dependencies (like database connections, user IDs, or API clients) to your tools and nodes at runtime rather than hardcoding them. For example, you can use user metadata in the runtime context to fetch user preferences and feed them into the context window. LangGraph provides three ways to manage context, which combines the mutability and lifetime dimensions: Context type Description Mutability Lifetime Access method Static runtime context User metadata, tools, db connections passed at startup Static Single run context argument to invoke / stream Dynamic runtime context (state) Mutable data that evolves during a single run Dynamic Single run LangGraph state object Dynamic cross-conversation context (store) Persistent data shared across conversations Dynamic Cross-conversation LangGraph store ​ Static runtime context Static runtime context represents immutable data like user metadata, tools, and database connections that are passed to an application at the start of a run via the context argument to invoke / stream . This data does not change during execution. Copy @dataclass class ContextSchema : user_name: str graph.invoke( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"hi!\" }]}, context = { \"user_name\" : \"John Smith\" } ) Agent prompt Workflow node In a tool Copy from dataclasses import dataclass from langchain.agents import create_agent from langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest @dataclass class ContextSchema : user_name: str @dynamic_prompt def personalized_prompt ( request : ModelRequest) -> str : user_name = request.runtime.context.user_name return f \"You are a helpful assistant. Address the user as { user_name } .\" agent = create_agent( model = \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\" , tools = [get_weather], middleware = [personalized_prompt], context_schema = ContextSchema ) agent.invoke( { \"messages\" : [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : \"what is the weather in sf\" }]}, context = ContextSchema( user_name = \"John Smith\" ) ) See Agents for details. Copy from langgraph.runtime import Runtime def node ( state : State, runtime : Runtime[ContextSchema]): user_name = runtime.context.user_name ... See the Graph API for details. Copy from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime @tool def get_user_email ( runtime : ToolRuntime[ContextSchema]) -> str : \"\"\"Retrieve user information based on user ID.\"\"\" # simulate fetching user info from a database email = get_user_email_from_db(runtime.context.user_name) return email See the tool calling guide for details. The Runtime object can be used to access static context and other utilities like the active store and stream writer. See the Runtime documentation for details. ​ Dynamic runtime context Dynamic runtime context represents mutable data that can evolve during a single run and is managed through the LangGraph state object. This includes conversation history, intermediate results, and values derived from tools or LLM outputs. In LangGraph, the state object acts as short-term memory during a run. In an agent In a workflow Example shows how to incorporate state into an agent prompt . State can also be accessed by the agent’s tools , which can read or update the state as needed. See tool calling guide for details. Copy from langchain.agents import create_agent from langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest from langchain.agents import AgentState class CustomState ( AgentState ): user_name: str @dynamic_prompt def personalized_prompt ( request : ModelRequest) -> str : user_name = request.state.get( \"user_name\" , \"User\" ) return f \"You are a helpful assistant. User's name is { user_name } \" agent = create_agent( model = \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\" , tools = [ ... ], state_schema = CustomState, middleware = [personalized_prompt], ) agent.invoke({ \"messages\" : \"hi!\" , \"user_name\" : \"John Smith\" }) Copy from typing_extensions import TypedDict from langchain.messages import AnyMessage from langgraph.graph import StateGraph class CustomState ( TypedDict ): messages: list[AnyMessage] extra_field: int def node ( state : CustomState): messages = state[ \"messages\" ] ... return { \"extra_field\" : state[ \"extra_field\" ] + 1 } builder = StateGraph(State) builder.add_node(node) builder.set_entry_point( \"node\" ) graph = builder.compile() Turning on memory Please see the memory guide for more details on how to enable memory. This is a powerful feature that allows you to persist the agent’s state across multiple invocations. Otherwise, the state is scoped only to a single run. ​ Dynamic cross-conversation context Dynamic cross-conversation context represents persistent, mutable data that spans across multiple conversations or sessions and is managed through the LangGraph store. This includes user profiles, preferences, and historical interactions. The LangGraph store acts as long-term memory across multiple runs. This can be used to read or update persistent facts (e.g., user profiles, preferences, prior interactions). ​ See also Memory conceptual overview Short-term memory in LangChain Long-term memory in LangChain Memory in LangGraph Edit this page on GitHub or file an issue .
