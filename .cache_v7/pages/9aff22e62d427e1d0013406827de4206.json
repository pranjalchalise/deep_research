The Piedmont region of South Carolina, like many areas across the southeastern United States, is experiencing significant urbanization. Relatively undisturbed forested areas are being cleared at an alarming... View Assessing Global Water Scarcity Conference Paper Mar 2007 W. R. Dripps B. Deknight There are currently several methods used to calculate water scarcity on a per-country basis. Some of the methods consider only physical water scarcity based on per capita availability or percent of available water currently used while others include economic factors. As global population increases and water scarcity becomes a more pressing politica... View Hydrogeologic Characterization of the Bunched Arrowhead, Sagittaria Fasculata Conference Paper Mar 2007 W. R. Dripps R. Baxter The Bunched Arrowhead is an endangered plant species known only to exist in Greenville County, South Carolina and Henderson County, North Carolina. The plant requires a very specific set of hydrogeologic conditions in order to survive. Increased development across the Piedmont region has already begun to encroach on the plant’s native habitat and h... View A Comparative Analysis of Stream Response to Storm Events Among Rural, Residential, and Commercial Watersheds Within the Piedmont Region, Greenville, South Carolina Conference Paper Mar 2007 W. R. Dripps J. Holden H. Hanford The Piedmont region of South Carolina, like many areas across the southeastern United States, is experiencing significant residential and commercial development. Relatively undisturbed forested areas are being rapidly cleared and urbanized. The impact that this conversion of land cover has on stream hydrology, biology, and ecology is an area of gre... View Earth Science and the Silver Screen Conference Paper Oct 2006 W. R. Dripps As the global population continues to grow and the associated stress to the world’s environmental systems escalates, the need for better scientific literacy and understanding of these often complex environmental issues by students is becoming increasingly important. Unfortunately for many students, particularly non-science majors, personal percepti... View Nitrogen in urban streams: Possible sources, sinks, and transformations Conference Paper Oct 2006 W. R. Dripps C. Brannon Andersen Gregory P. Lewis Suresh Muthukrishnan In the piedmont of the southeastern United States, urbanization typically begins along the topographic divides between watersheds. As a result, urban areas tend to develop around the headwaters of streams, and any agricultural areas occur along downstream reaches. This pattern of urbanization is useful for understanding the impact of urbanization o... View Estimating Recharge Rates with Analytic Element Models and Parameter Estimation Article Jan 2006 W. R. Dripps Randall J Hunt Mary P. Anderson Quantifying the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge is usually a prerequisite for effective ground water flow modeling. In this study, an analytic element (AE) code (GFLOW) was used with a nonlinear parameter estimation code (UCODE) to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge using measured base flows as calibration targ... View Utilizing Soil Moisture and Water Table Data for Assessing Ground Water Recharge Conference Paper Full-text available Oct 2005 W. R. Dripps Mary P. Anderson Randall J Hunt Quantifying ground water recharge remains one of the seminal problems in hydrologic research and evaluation. Recharge varies spatially and temporally and is one of the most difficult, complex, and uncertain hydrologic parameters to quantify in the water budget. Monitoring changes in soil moisture content at multiple depths in the unsaturated zone a... View Implementation of a Daily Soil Water Balance Model for Estimating Spatial and Temporal Distributions of Aquifer Recharge Conference Paper Oct 2005 W. R. Dripps Vic Kelson A simple, daily soil-water balance model was developed to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge for watersheds in humid regions (Dripps, 2003). The model was implemented using Visual Basic within Microsoft Excel; although this software architecture worked well for the original implementation, its computational performance is in... View Using computer vision technology to evaluate the meat tenderness of grazing beef Article Full-text available Aug 2005 Yong Q Tian D.G. McCall W. R. Dripps [...] P. Gong Raw meat surface features from non-grazing animals are reported to be correlated with meat tenderness. However, meat from grazing beef may have different tenderness to that of non-grazing beef due to differences in activity and diet. The feasibility of using meat surface characteristics from grazing beef in New Zealand to estimate meat sensory tend... View Groundwater Issues Chapter Jan 2003 David P. Ahlfeld W. R. Dripps View The Use of Temperature Profiles Through Unsaturated Soils to Estimate Short-term Rates of Natural Groundwater Recharge Article May 2001 W. R. Dripps Mary P. Anderson Randall J Hunt It has long been recognized that infiltration influences the vertical subsurface temperature profile. Many researchers have used changes in the temperature profile to quantify the rate of groundwater flow in saturated systems, e.g. in wetlands and streambeds. Others have considered coupled heat and flow transport through the unsaturated zone, but w... View Modeling the Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Groundwater Recharge Across a Forested Watershed in Northern Wisconsin Article May 2001 W. R. Dripps Christopher J. Kucharik J. D. Lenters [...] Jacqui Foley The spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater recharge depends on the complex interaction of hydrologic, atmospheric, pedologic, vegetative, and geologic processes, making it one of the most difficult and uncertain hydrologic parameters to quantify, yet understanding its distribution is a basic prerequisite for effective groundwater resource... View Cross‐Well Slug Testing in Unconfined Aquifers: A Case Study from the Sleepers River Watershed, Vermont Article May 1999 Kenneth Belitz W. R. Dripps Normally, slug test measurements are limited to the well in which the water level is perturbed. Consequently, it is often difficult to obtain reliable estimates of hydraulic properties, particularly if the aquifer is anisotropic or if there is a wellbore skin. In this investigation, we use partially penetrating stress and observation wells to evalu... View Slug tests in elastic, unconfined aquifers: Incorporating the free surface Article Dec 1995 Kenneth Belitz W. R. Dripps J. E. Fairchild In this paper we evaluate slug tests in shallow, fully screened wells that completely penetrate homogeneous, anisotropic, elastic, unconfined aquifers. If the free surface is incorporated into the initial boundary value problem, the dimensionless head (HD) is a function of five parameters: dimensionless time (tD), system geometry and anisotropy (η)...
