  "data": "Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is widely used by developers in various domains, from web development to Machine Learning. However, Python has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Let's see some limitations of Python programming language. Cons of Python Programming Python is Slow at Runtime Mobile Application Development Difficulty in Using Other Languages High Memory Consumption Not used in the Enterprise Development Sector Runtime Errors Simplicity Python is Slow at Runtime Python is an interpreted language and is slow compared to C / C++ or Java . Unlike C or C++ it's not closer to hardware because Python is a high-level language. As we all know compilation and execution help to work normally, but in this case, the execution of Python takes place with the help of an interpreter instead of the compiler as we have seen that Python code is executed line by line, which causes it to slow down. Speed is a focal point for the project required by any programmer. On the other hand, it can be seen that it is fast for many web applications too. Mobile Application Development However Python is strong in desktop and server platforms, that is it is an excellent server-side language but for mobile development, Python is not a very good language which means it is a weak language for mobile development. It is very rarely used for mobile development. This is the reason very few mobile applications are built into it like Carbonnelle, which is built in Python. Difficulty in Using Other Languages The Python lovers become so accustomed to its features and its extensive libraries that they face problem in learning or working on other programming languages. High Memory Consumption For any memory intensive tasks Python is not a good choice. That is why it is not used for that purpose. Python's memory consumption is also high, due to the flexibility of the data types. Not used in Enterprise Development Sector Python is a robust programming language with minimal stress and worries. But, this language is highly insecure and can be used only at one’s own risk. There are some limitations of Python with database access. In comparison to the popular technologies like JDBC and ODBC, it is found that Python's database access layer is a bit underdeveloped and primitive. It acts as a major barrier when big enterprises look for a language that ensures smooth interaction of complex legacy data. However, the enterprises that need smooth interaction of complex legacy data, the Python database access layer is not applied. That is, it is less often applied in huge enterprises. Runtime Errors One of the major drawbacks of this language is that its design has numerous issues. Python programmers face several issues regarding the design of the language. This language requires more testing and also it has errors that only show up at runtime this is because the language is dynamically typed. Simplicity Python is a simple programming language which is also the biggest disadvantage. It can indeed be a problem. Its syntax is very simple which makes a programmer more of python person and because of which they might feel code of harder language like Java unnecessary. It concludes that with its late-binding dynamic models and extensive libraries, shifting to a new language from Python gets difficult as the user finds it difficult to adjust to its vulnerable nature and taking everything on a light note."
