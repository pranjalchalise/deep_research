Development of various energy-harvesting devices, topologies, and circuitries, aimed at creating \"zero-power\" self-sustainable standalone electronics is expected to propel market expansion. Technological advancements, industrial applications, and focus on sustainable energy solutions offer lucrative opportunities to market players. Competition among energy harvesting sensor producers is intensifying as the demand for these devices continues to grow. Several companies are entering the market, leading to a diverse range of products and technologies. Producers are striving to differentiate themselves by offering innovative features, improved efficiency, and cost-effective solutions. Global Energy Harvesting for Small Sensors Market Introduction Energy harvesting for small sensors is a technology where sensors generate their own power from the surrounding environment, eliminating the need for an external power source such as batteries or wired connections. These sensors are designed to harvest energy from the environment in various forms, such as light, heat, vibration, or radio frequency signals, and convert it into electrical energy to power their operations. Standalone energy harvesting sensors have a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, structural health monitoring , industrial process monitoring, smart agriculture, asset tracking, wearable and IoT devices, smart home automation, and transportation logistics. These sensors offer advantages such as reduced maintenance, increased deployment flexibility, and extended operational lifetime, making them ideal for low-power applications in remote or challenging environments. Increase in Demand for Energy Harvesting in IoT Devices Energy harvesting enables IoT devices to become self-sufficient in terms of power. Traditional battery-powered devices require regular battery replacements or recharging, which can be inconvenient and costly, especially for devices deployed in remote or inaccessible locations. Energy harvesting technologies, such as solar, thermal, kinetic, or electromagnetic energy harvesting, allow IoT devices to generate power from their surroundings, eliminating the need for external power sources or frequent battery replacements. Advancements in energy harvesting technologies, such as improved efficiency and miniaturization, have made it easier to integrate energy harvesting capabilities into smaller and more power-constrained IoT devices. These technological advancements have expanded the range of IoT applications that can benefit from energy harvesting, including wearable devices, wireless sensor networks, and implantable medical devices. Internet of Things (IoT) has experienced rapid growth in terms of number of connected devices, with 22 billion devices expected by the end of 2022, a significant increase from the 900 million devices recorded five years ago. Increase in Usage of Wearable Devices Improvement in the standard of living is expected to increase adoption of smart wearable devices. Integration of self-powered sensors in these devices will not only drive the overall wearable devices industry, but also enhance their cost-effectiveness Self-powered sensors play a vital role in providing the necessary energy supply for portable and wearable products, such as wearable health monitors and tracking devices. Consumers are drawn to wearable devices because they offer the convenience of monitoring their health from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need for frequent check-ups or travel. Additionally, wearable devices are utilized for tracking purposes, allowing individuals to keep tabs on various aspects of their lives. The wearable devices segment has experienced significant transformation in the past few years. Rise in utilization of wearable devices directly contributes to the expansion of the global energy harvesting for small sensors industry. Photovoltaic, Ambient RF, and Vibration to be Emerging Harvesting Options Photovoltaic, ambient RF, and vibration are the most trending types of energy harvesting. This is ascribed to easy integration. For instance, e-peas recently launched power management ICs that have an innovative buck-boost architecture that helps devices to deal with low voltages. It targets RF-harvesting applications. It can harvest energies as low as 275mV/3µW from the environment. In 2021, Wiliot, a fabless IoT company, released its Bluetooth tag for easy tracking of shipments such as food and medicine. ON Semiconductor’s RSL10 is a multi-sensor platform based on ultra-low-power solar cells. It integrates a low-profile 47µF storage capacitor onboard for energy storage. Its power consumption is just 55nW in standby mode and 10mW in Rx and Tx mode. The Northwestern and George Washington Universities have developed a wireless, battery-free, and fully implantable temporary pacemaker that dissolves when no longer needed. The pacemaker harvests energy from external near-field antennas, similar to the RFID technology. This wireless power transfer eliminates any leads that can introduce infections.
