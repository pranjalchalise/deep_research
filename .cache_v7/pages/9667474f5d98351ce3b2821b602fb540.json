POSTECH announced on the 29th that a research team led by Professor Byung-sub Kim of the Department of Electrical Engineering has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automate analog semiconductor design, a task that has traditionally relied on human intuition and experience. The research was published on October 6 of last year in 'IEEE Transactions&nbsp;on Circuits and Systems'. &nbsp; Analog semiconductor design requires engineers to manually place components according to numerous rules, a process that dictates circuit performance and stability. Attempts at automation have been hindered by the sheer complexity of the structures and the fact that design methods vary significantly from one circuit to another, making AI application difficult. Furthermore, since semiconductor design data is a core corporate asset and rarely disclosed publicly, there is a lack of data available for training AI models. &nbsp; The research team applied the concept of a 'foundation model'—a general-purpose AI model that is pre-trained on a large dataset and can perform various tasks with only a small amount of additional fine-tuning—to analog semiconductor layout design. They used a 'self-supervised learning' method, where the AI learns design rules on its own without being given correct answers by humans. &nbsp; The team trained the AI by dividing an analog layout into small pieces, masking some of them, and then tasking the AI with predicting the masked parts. From just six types of semiconductor design data, they automatically generated about 320,000 pieces of training data. By training the AI with this generated data, it learned to identify common, recurring structures and patterns in analog layouts on its own. &nbsp; After the AI learned the fundamental principles, it was fine-tuned with a small amount of additional data. As a result, the AI could perform five essential tasks for semiconductor layout design. These tasks include generating structures to electrically connect different circuit layers, designing metal wiring paths, and&nbsp;placing auxiliary patterns to enhance circuit stability.&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental results&nbsp;showed that 96.6% of the layouts generated by the AI passed both design rule checks and circuit verification. This performance was achieved using only one-eighth of the data required by conventional methods. &nbsp; This research is expected to contribute to increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the semiconductor industry by reducing the burden on design engineers and shortening development time. \"We were able to substantially expand the possibilities for automating analog semiconductor design, which had been stalled by a lack of data,\" said Professor Byung-sub Kim. &nbsp; &lt;Reference&gt; doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2025.3615646 Copyright ⓒ DongA Science.
