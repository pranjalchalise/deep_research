On paper: flawless. On site: clashes, rework, and invisible cost overruns. Where it quietly goes wrong 👇 • Design reviews done for approval, not accuracy. • Steel grades reused from old BOQs invisible tons, hidden crores. • Connection joints drawn beautifully, fabricated painfully. • Outdated fabrication flows that choke productivity. • Civil and steel teams designing in isolation, not in collaboration. 🏗️ These aren’t minor oversights they’re structural profit leaks that most PEB players overlook. At Pranjal Projects, we’ve built our foundation on engineering intelligence three generations and 45+ years of turning complex steel design into simple, seamless execution. Our strength has never been in selling steel it’s in understanding it.From design intent to fabrication flow, every bolt, beam, and connection is engineered for efficiency, precision, and longevity. 💡 Because the best EPC outcomes don’t come from cheaper steel they come from smarter design. 📎 Explore how we combine design depth with engineering discipline to save crores before the first beam is raised. 🌐 pranjalprojects.net | ✉️ info@pranjalprojects.net | 📞 +91 9810008544 #EPCProjects #InfrastructureDesign #StructuralEngineering #SteelStructures #HighRiseConstruction #BridgeEngineering #DesignOptimization #FabricationExcellence #ModernInfrastructure #EngineeringIntelligence #CivilMeetsSteel #PranjalProjects …more 8 3 Comments Like Comment Share Pranjal Projects 6,735 followers 1w Report this post Engineering That Delivers – From Boilers to Buckets, and Beyond At Pranjal Projects Pvt.

Yet, most PEB projects still get delayed. Here’s why: • No in-house design team • No understanding of where civil meets steel • No in-house erection team What follows is a blame cycle: The Developer blames the EPC → The EPC blames the Designer → The Designer blames the Fabricator → The Fabricator blames the Erector Speed is lost at the interfaces. This is where Pranjal Projects is different. We deliver end-to-end execution — • In-house design • Civil + steel integration • In-house erection • Execution through finishing One team. One accountability. No blame game.

It is a fabrication driven engineering case study. The project demanded far more than scale. It required absolute control over geometry, tolerances, sequencing, and integration while preserving architectural expression through exposed steel and composite systems. What defined the complexity: • Architecturally expressive, exposed composite steel structure • Diagonal grid systems, radial beams, and curvilinear box girders • Large-diameter hollow steel columns working with a central RCC core • Cantilevered members and circumferential steel elements • Alternate hinge and fixed joint strategy to balance expression and performance How it was engineered and fabricated: • Entire structure digitally resolved in Tekla Structures before fabrication • Fabrication drawings issued with coordinate control for every steel member • Tight tolerance fabrication to manage complex geometry and curved profiles • Pre-engineered sleeves and openings for seamless MEP integration • Composite floors using steel decking to accelerate construction timelines How execution was controlled on site: • Total Station mapping used to transfer digital coordinates to physical erection • Member-by-member verification to ensure millimetrelevel accuracy • Fabrication and erection sequencing planned to protect alignment and stability • Fire performance and durability addressed at the fabrication stage itself The attached document captures how fabrication thinking, not site correction, enables complex composite buildings to be delivered efficiently, accurately, and at architectural scale.
