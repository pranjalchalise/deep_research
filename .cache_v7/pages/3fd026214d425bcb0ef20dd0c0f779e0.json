CERN - Six Decades of Science, Innovation, Cooperation, and Inspiration DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Quigg, Chris The European Laboratory for Particle Physics, which straddles the Swiss-French border northwest of Geneva, celebrates its sixtieth birthday in 2014 CERN is the preeminent particle-physics institution in the world, currently emphasizing the study of collisions of protons and heavy nuclei at very high energies and the exploration of physics on the electroweak scale (energies where electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force merge). With brilliant accomplishments in research, innovation, and education, and a sustained history of cooperation among people from different countries and cultures, CERN ranks as one of the signal achievements of the postwar European Project. For physicists the worldmoreÂ Â» over, the laboratory is a source of pride and inspiration.Â«Â less Contextualized Magnetism in Secondary School: Learning from the LHC (CERN) ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Cid, Ramon 2005-01-01 Physics teachers in secondary schools usually mention the world's largest particle physics laboratory--CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research)--only because of the enormous size of the accelerators and detectors used there, the number of scientists involved in their activities and also the necessary international scientificâ¦ HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS: CERN Link Breathes Life Into Russian Physics. PubMed Stone, R 2000-10-13 Without fanfare, 600 Russian scientists here at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory, are playing key roles in building the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a machine that will explore fundamental questions such as why particles have mass, as well as search for exotic new particles whose existence would confirm supersymmetry, a popular theory that aims to unify the four forces of nature. In fact, even though Russia is not one of CERN's 20 member states, most top high-energy physicists in Russia are working on the LHC. Some say their work could prove the salvation of high-energy physics back home. PARTICLE PHYSICS: CERN Gives Higgs Hunters Extra Month to Collect Data. PubMed Morton, O 2000-09-22 After 11 years of banging electrons and positrons together at higher energies than any other machine in the world, CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, had decided to shut down the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP) and install a new machine, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in its 27-kilometer tunnel. In 2005, the LHC will start bashing protons together at even higher energies. But tantalizing hints of a long-sought fundamental particle have forced CERN managers to grant LEP a month's reprieve.

PubMed Seife, C 2000-07-14 Last week, particle physicists at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland announced that by smashing together matter and antimatter in four experiments, they detected an unexpected effect in the sprays of particles that ensued. The anomaly is subtle, and physicists caution that it might still be a statistical fluke. If confirmed, however, it could mark the long-sought discovery of a whole zoo of new particles--and the end of a long-standing model of particle physics. LHC@Home: a BOINC-based volunteer computing infrastructure for physics studies at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Barranco, Javier; Cai, Yunhai; Cameron, David; Crouch, Matthew; Maria, Riccardo De; Field, Laurence; Giovannozzi, Massimo; Hermes, Pascal; HÃ¸imyr, Nils; Kaltchev, Dobrin; Karastathis, Nikos; Luzzi, Cinzia; Maclean, Ewen; McIntosh, Eric; Mereghetti, Alessio; Molson, James; Nosochkov, Yuri; Pieloni, Tatiana; Reid, Ivan D.; Rivkin, Lenny; Segal, Ben; Sjobak, Kyrre; Skands, Peter; Tambasco, Claudia; Veken, Frederik Van der; Zacharov, Igor 2017-12-01 The LHC@Home BOINC project has provided computing capacity for numerical simulations to researchers at CERN since 2004, and has since 2011 been expanded with a wider range of applications. The traditional CERN accelerator physics simulation code SixTrack enjoys continuing volunteers support, and thanks to virtualisation a number of applications from the LHC experiment collaborations and particle theory groups have joined the consolidated LHC@Home BOINC project. This paper addresses the challenges related to traditional and virtualized applications in the BOINC environment, and how volunteer computing has been integrated into the overall computing strategy of the laboratory through the consolidated LHC@Home service. Thanks to the computing power provided by volunteers joining LHC@Home, numerous accelerator beam physics studies have been carried out, yielding an improved understanding of charged particle dynamics in the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its future upgrades. The main results are highlighted in this paper. CERN: A European laboratory for a global project NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Voss, RÃ¼diger 2015-06-01 In the most important shift of paradigm of its membership rules in 60 years, CERN in 2010 introduced a policy of âGeographical Enlargementâ which for the first time opened the door for membership of non-European States in the Organization. This short article reviews briefly the history of CERN's membership rules, discusses the rationale behind the new policy, its relationship with the emerging global roadmap of particle physics, and gives a short overview of the status of the enlargement process. A possible biomedical facility at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). PubMed Dosanjh, M; Jones, B; Myers, S 2013-05-01 A well-attended meeting, called \"Brainstorming discussion for a possible biomedical facility at CERN\", was held by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics on 25 June 2012. This was concerned with adapting an existing, but little used, 78-m circumference CERN synchrotron to deliver a wide range of ion species, preferably from protons to at least neon ions, with beam specifications that match existing clinical facilities. The potential extensive research portfolio discussed included beam ballistics in humanoid phantoms, advanced dosimetry, remote imaging techniques and technical developments in beam delivery, including gantry design. In addition, a modern laboratory for biomedical characterisation of these beams would allow important radiobiological studies, such as relative biological effectiveness, in a dedicated facility with standardisation of experimental conditions and biological end points. A control photon and electron beam would be required nearby for relative biological effectiveness comparisons. Research beam time availability would far exceed that at other facilities throughout the world. This would allow more rapid progress in several biomedical areas, such as in charged hadron therapy of cancer, radioisotope production and radioprotection. The ethos of CERN, in terms of open access, peer-reviewed projects and governance has been so successful for High Energy Physics that application of the same to biomedicine would attract high-quality research, with possible contributions from Europe and beyond, along with potential new funding streams.

As in previous years, this meeting gathered more than 70 participants in the early years of their scientific careers. This issue contains the proceedings of the workshop. As in the past, the Hot Quarks workshop offered a unique atmosphere for a lively discussion and interpretation of the current measurements from high energy nuclear collisions. Recent results and upgrades at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Brookhaven's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) were presented. Measurements from the proton-led run at the CERN-LHC were shown for the first time at this meeting. Recent theoretical developments were also extensively discussed, as well as the proposals for future facilities such as the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at Darmstadt, the Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven, and the LHeC. The conference's goal to provide a platform for young researchers to learn and foster their interactions was successfully met.

Radiation protection challenges in the management of radioactive waste from high-energy accelerators. PubMed Ulrici, Luisa; Algoet, Yvon; Bruno, Luca; Magistris, Matteo 2015-04-01 The European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) has operated high-energy accelerators for fundamental physics research for nearly 60 y. The side-product of this activity is the radioactive waste, which is mainly generated as a result of preventive and corrective maintenance, upgrading activities and the dismantling of experiments or accelerator facilities. Prior to treatment and disposal, it is common practice to temporarily store radioactive waste on CERN's premises and it is a legal requirement that these storage facilities are safe and secure. Waste treatment typically includes sorting, segregation, volume and size reduction and packaging, which will depend on the type of component, its chemical composition, residual activity and possible surface contamination. At CERN, these activities are performed in a dedicated waste treatment centre under the supervision of the Radiation Protection Group. This paper gives an overview of the radiation protection challenges in the conception of a temporary storage and treatment centre for radioactive waste in an accelerator facility, based on the experience gained at CERN. The CERN approach consists of the classification of waste items into 'families' with similar radiological and physical-chemical properties. This classification allows the use of specific, family-dependent techniques for radiological characterisation and treatment, which are simultaneously efficient and compliant with best practices in radiation protection. The storage was planned on the basis of radiological and other possible hazards such as toxicity, pollution and fire load. Examples are given of technical choices for the treatment and radiological characterisation of selected waste families, which could be of interest to other accelerator facilities. Â© The Author 2014.

CERN's approach to public outreach NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Landua, Rolf 2016-03-01 CERN's communication goes beyond publishing scientific results. Education and outreach are equally important ways of communicating with the general public, and in particular with the young generation. Over the last decade, CERN has significantly increased its efforts to accommodate the very large interest of the general public (about 300,000 visit requests per year), by ramping up its capacity for guided tours from 25,000 to more than 100,000 visitors per year, by creating six new of state-of-the-art exhibitions on-site, by building and operating a modern physics laboratory for school teachers and students, and by showing several traveling exhibitions in about 10 countries per year. The offer for school teachers has also been expanded, to 35-40 weeks of teacher courses with more than 1000 participants from more than 50 countries per year. The talk will give an overview about these and related activities. Princeton University High Energy Physics Research DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Marlow, Daniel R. This is the Final Report on research conducted by the Princeton Elementary Particles group over the approximately three-year period from May 1, 2012 to April 30, 2015. The goal of our research is to investigate the fundamental constituents of matter, their fields, and their interactions; to understand the properties of space and time; and to study the profound relationships between cosmology and particle physics. During the funding period covered by this report, the group has been organized into a subgroup concentrating on the theory of particles, strings, and cosmology; and four subgroups performing major experiments at laboratories around the world: CERN, Daya Bay, Gran Sasso as well as detector R\\\\&D on the Princeton campus. Highlights in of this research include the discovery of the Higgs Boson at CERN and the measurement ofmoreÂ Â» $$\\\\sin^22\\\\theta_{13}$$ by the Daya Bay experiment.

Recent advances in photolithography and micro processing techniques have enabled the transition from Multi Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs) and Drift Chambers to a new family of gaseous detectors refer to as Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs). MPGDs combine the basic gas amplification principle with micro-structure printed circuits to provide detectors with excellent spatial and time resolution, high rate capability, low material budget and high radiation tolerance. Gas Electron Multiplier (GEMs) is a well-established MPGD technology invented by F. Sauli at CERN in 1997 and deployed various high energy physics (HEP) and nuclear NP experiment for tracking systems of current and future NP experiments. GEM detector combines an exceptional high rate capability (1 MHz / mm2) and robustness against harsh radiation environment with excellent position and timing resolution performances. Recent breakthroughs over the past decade have allowed the possibility for large area GEMs, making them cost effective and high-performance detector candidates to play pivotal role in current and future particle physics experiments. After a brief introduction of the basic principle of GEM technology, I will give a brief overview of the GEM detectors used in particle physics experiments over the past decades and especially in the NP community at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). I will follow by a review of state of the art of the new GEM development for the next generation of colliders such as Electron Ion Collider (EIC) or High Luminosity LHC and future Nuclear Physics experiments. I will conclude with a presentation of the CERN-based RD51 collaboration established in 2008 and its major achievements regarding technological developments and applications of MPGDs. PREFACE: Hot Quarks 2014: Workshop for young scientists on the physics of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 2015-05-01 The 6th edition of the Workshop for Young Scientists on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions (Hot Quarks 2014) was held in Las Negras, Spain from 21-28 September 2014. Following the traditions of the conference, this meeting gathered more than 70 participants in the first years of their scientific careers. The present issue contains the proceedings of this workshop. As in the past, the Hot Quarks workshop offered a unique atmosphere for a lively discussion and interpretation of the current measurements from high energy nuclear collisions. Recent results and upgrades at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Brookhaven's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) were presented. Recent theoretical developments were also extensively discussed as well as the perspectives for future facilities such as the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at Darmstadt and the Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven. The conference's goal to provide a platform for young researchers to learn and foster their interactions was successfully met.

F.; Deveney, E. F.; Jones, N. L.; Vane, C. R.; Datz, S.; Knudsen, H.; GrafstrÃ¶m, P.; Schuch, R. 1997-04-01 Recent atomic physics studies involving ultrarelativistic Pb ions required solid target positioners, scintillators, and a sophisticated data acquisition and control system placed in a remote location at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron near Geneva, Switzerland. The apparatus, installed in a high-radiation zone underground, had to (i) function for months, (ii) automatically respond to failures such as power outages and particle-induced computer upsets, and (iii) communicate with the outside world via a telephone line. The heart of the apparatus developed was an Apple Macintosh-based CAMAC system that answered the telephone and interpreted and executed remote control commands that (i) sensed and set targets, (ii) controlled voltages and discriminator levels for scintillators, (iii) modified data acquisition hardware logic, (iv) reported control information, and (v) automatically synchronized data acquisition to the CERN spill cycle via a modem signal and transmitted experimental data to a remote computer. No problems were experienced using intercontinental telephone connections at 1200 baud. Our successful \"virtual laboratory\" approach that uses off-the-shelf electronics is generally adaptable to more conventional bench-type experiments. How hadron collider experiments contributed to the development of QCD: from hard-scattering to the perfect liquid DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Tannenbaum, M. J. A revolution in elementary particle physics occurred during the period from the ICHEP1968 to the ICHEP1982 with the advent of the parton model from discoveries in Deeply Inelastic electron-proton Scattering at SLAC, neutrino experiments, hard-scattering observed in p+p collisions at the CERN ISR, the development of QCD, the discovery of the J/Î¨ at BNL and SLAC and the clear observation of high transverse momentum jets at the CERN SPSmoreÂ Â» $$\\\\bar{p}$$ + p collider. These and other discoveries in this period led to the acceptance of QCD as the theory of the strong interactions. The desire to understand nuclear physics at high density such as in neutron stars led to the application of QCD to this problem and to the prediction of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in nuclei at high energy density and temperatures. This eventually led to the construction of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL to observe superdense nuclear matter in the laboratory. This article discusses how experimental methods and results which confirmed QCD at the first hadron collider, the CERN ISR, played an important role in experiments at the first heavy ion collider, RHIC, leading to the discovery of the QGP as a perfect liquid as well as discoveries at RHIC and the LHC which continue to the present day.Â«Â less How hadron collider experiments contributed to the development of QCD: from hard-scattering to the perfect liquid DOE PAGES Tannenbaum, M.

Beam experiments with the Grenoble test electron cyclotron resonance ion source at iThemba LABS DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Thomae, R., E-mail: rthomae@tlabs.ac.za; Conradie, J.; Fourie, D. 2016-02-15 At iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator Based Sciences (iThemba LABS) an electron cyclotron ion source was installed and commissioned. This source is a copy of the Grenoble Test Source (GTS) for the production of highly charged ions. The source is similar to the GTS-LHC at CERN and named GTS2. A collaboration between the Accelerators and Beam Physics Group of CERN and the Accelerator and Engineering Department of iThemba LABS was proposed in which the development of high intensity argon and xenon beams is envisaged. In this paper, we present beam experiments with the GTS2 at iThemba LABS, in which the resultsmoreÂ Â» of continuous wave and afterglow operation of xenon ion beams with oxygen as supporting gases are presented.Â«Â less Dissecting the Science of \"Angels and Demons\" or Antimatter and Other Matters (Vernon W.

In the past year, CERN Cloud Infrastructure has seen a constant increase in nodes, virtual machines, users and projects. This paper will present what has been done in order to make the CERN cloud infrastructure scale out. CERN welcomes new members NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 2017-08-01 Lithuania is on course to become an associate member of CERN, pending final approval by the Lithuanian parliament. Associate membership will allow representatives of the Baltic nation to take part in meetings of the CERN Council, which oversees the Geneva-based physics lab. Answering GauguinÃ¢ÂÂs Questions: Where Are We Coming From, Where Are We Going, and What Are We? ScienceCinema Ellis, John [CERN 2017-12-09 The knowledge of matter revealed by the current reigning theory of particle physics, the so-called Standard Model, still leaves open many basic questions. What is the origin of the matter in the Universe? How does its mass originate? What is the nature of the dark matter that fills the Universe? Are there additional dimensions of space? The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, where high-energy experiments have now started, will take physics into a new realm of energy and time, and will address these physics analogues of Gauguin's questions. The answers will set the stage for possible future experiments beyond the scope of the LHC. Quark-Gluon Soup -- The Perfectly Liquid Phase of QCD NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Heinz, Ulrich 2015-03-01 At temperatures above about 150 MeV and energy densities exceeding 500 MeV/fm3, quarks and gluons exist in the form of a plasma of free color charges that is about 1000 times hotter and a billion times denser than any other plasma ever created in the laboratory. This quark-gluon plasma (QGP) turns out to be strongly coupled, flowing like a liquid. About 35 years ago, the nuclear physics community started a program of relativistic heavy-ion collisions with the goal of producing and studying QGP under controlled laboratory conditions. This article recounts the story of its successful creation in collider experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CERN and the subsequent discovery of its almost perfectly liquid nature, and reports on the recent quantitatively precise determination of its thermodynamic and transport properties.

CERN-derived analysis of lunar radiation backgrounds NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Wilson, Thomas L.; Svoboda, Robert 1993-01-01 The Moon produces radiation which background-limits scientific experiments there. Early analyses of these backgrounds have either failed to take into consideration the effect of charm in particle physics (because they pre-dated its discovery), or have used branching ratios which are no longer strictly valid (due to new accelerator data). We are presently investigating an analytical program for deriving muon and neutrino spectra generated by the Moon, converting an existing CERN computer program known as GEANT which does the same for the Earth. In so doing, this will (1) determine an accurate prompt neutrino spectrum produced by the lunar surface; (2) determine the lunar subsurface particle flux; (3) determine the consequence of charm production physics upon the lunar background radiation environment; and (4) provide an analytical tool for the NASA astrophysics community with which to begin an assessment of the Moon as a scientific laboratory versus its particle radiation environment. This will be done on a recurring basis with the latest experimental results of the particle data groups at Earth-based high-energy accelerators, in particular with the latest branching ratios for charmed meson decay. This will be accomplished for the first time as a full 3-dimensional simulation. Experimental Nuclear Physics Activity in Italy NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Chiavassa, E.; de Marco, N. 2003-04-01 The experimental Nuclear Physics activity of the Italian researchers is briefly reviewed. The experiments, that are financially supported by the INFN, are done in strict collaboration by more than 500 INFN and University researchers. The experiments cover all the most important field of the modern Nuclear Physics with probes extremely different in energy and interactions. Researches are done in all the four National Laboratories of the INFN even if there is a deeper involvement of the two national laboratories expressly dedicated to Nuclear Physics: the LNL (Laboratorio Nazionale di Legnaro) and LNS (Laboratorio Nazionale del Sud) where nuclear spectroscopy and reaction dynamics are investigated. All the activities with electromagnetic probes develops in abroad laboratories as TJNAF, DESY, MAMI, ESFR and are dedicated to the studies of the spin physics and of the nucleon resonance; hypernuclear and kaon physics is investigated at LNF. A strong community of researchers work in the relativistic and ultra-relativistic heavy ions field in particular at CERN with the SPS Pb beam and in the construction of the ALICE detector for heavy-ion physics at the LHC collider. Experiments of astrophysical interest are done with ions of very low energy; in particular the LUNA accelerator facility at LNGS (Laboratorio Nazionale del Gran Sasso) succeeded measuring cross section at solar energies, below or near the solar Gamow peak. Interdisciplinary researches on anti-hydrogen atom spectroscopy and on measurements of neutron cross sections of interest for ADS development are also supported.

ALICE detector in construction phase NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Peryt, Wiktor S. 2005-09-01 ALICE1 collaboration, which prepares one of the biggest physics experiments in the history, came into production phase of its detector. The experiment will start at LHC2 at CERN in 2007/2008. In the meantime about 1000 people from ~70 institutions are involved in this enterprise. ALICE detector consists of many sub-detectors, designed and manufactured in many laboratories and commercial firms, located mainly in Europe, but also in U.S., India, China and Korea. To assure appropriate working environment for such a specific task, strictly related to tests of particular components, measurements and assembly procedures Detector Construction Database system has been designed and implemented at CERN and at some labs involved in these activities. In this paper special attention is paid to this topic not only due to fact of innovative approach to the problem. Another reason is the group of young computer scientists (mainly students) from the Warsaw University of Technology, leaded by the author, has designed and developed the system for the whole experiment3. Another very interesting subject is the Data Acquisition System which has to fulfill very hard requirements concerning speed and high bandwidth. Required technical performance is achieved thanks to using PCI bus (usually in previous high energy physics experiments VME standard has been used) and optical links. Very general overview of the whole detector and physics goals of ALICE experiment will also be given. Elementary Particle Physics and High Energy Phenomena: Final Report for FY2010-13 DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Cumalat, John P.; de Alwis, Senarath P.; DeGrand, Thomas A. 2013-06-27 The work under this grant consists of experimental, theoretical, and phenomenological research on the fundamental properties of high energy subnuclear particles. The work is conducted at the University of Colorado, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC), Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and other facilities, employing neutrino-beam experiments, test beams of various particles, and proton-proton collider experiments. It emphasizes mass generation and symmetry-breaking, neutrino oscillations, bottom particle production and decay, detector development, supergravity, supersymmetry, superstrings, quantum chromodynamics, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, cosmology, phase transitions,moreÂ Â» lattice gauge theory, and anomaly-free theories. The goals are to improve our understanding of the basic building blocks of matter and their interactions. Data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN have revealed new interactions responsible for particle mass, and perhaps will lead to a more unified picture of the forces among elementary material constituents. To this end our research includes searches for manifestations of theories such as supersymmetry and new gauge bosons, as well as the production and decay of heavy-flavored quarks. Our current work at J-PARC, and future work at new facilities currently under conceptual design, investigate the specifics of how the neutrinos change flavor. The research is integrated with the training of students at all university levels, benefiting both the manpower and intellectual base for future technologies.Â«Â less NÂ° 15-2000: ESA, CERN and ESO launch \"Physics on Stage\" NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 2000-03-01 But how much do the citizens of Europe really know about physics? Here is a unique opportunity to learn more about this elusive subject! Beginning in February 2000, three major European research establishments [1] are organising a unique Europe-wide programme to raise the public awareness of physics and related sciences. \"Physics on Stage\" is launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), with support from the European Union (EU). Other partners include the European Physical Society (EPS) and the European Association for Astronomy Education (EAAE). This exciting programme is part of the European Week for Science and Technology and will culminate in a Science Festival during November 6-11, 2000, at CERN, Geneva. Why \"Physics on Stage\"? The primary goal of \"Physics on Stage\" is to counteract the current decline in interest and knowledge of physics among Europe's citizens by means of a series of highly visible promotional activities. It will bring together leading scientists and educators, government bodies and the media, to confront the diminishing attraction of physics to young people and to develop strategies to reverse this trend. The objective in the short term is to infuse excitement and to provide new educational materials. In the longer term, \"Physics on Stage\" will generate new developments by enabling experts throughout Europe to meet, exchange and innovate. \"Physics on Stage\" in 22 European Countries. \"Physics on Stage\" has been initiated in 22 European countries [2]. In each country, a dedicated National Steering Committee (NSC) is being formed which will be responsible for their own national programme. A list of contact addresses is attached below. \"Physics on Stage\" is based on a series of high-profile physics-related activities that will inform the European public in general, and European high school physics teachers and media representatives in particular, about innovative ways to convey information about physics. It will stress the intimate connection of this natural science with our daily lives. It will be accompanied by a broad media debate on these subjects. This effort is undertaken in the context of a progressive decline in physics literacy amongst the European population at all levels and ages. Fewer and fewer young people are attracted towards careers in core sciences and technologies - this could potentially lead to a crisis in European technology in the coming decades unless action is taken now. Too few people possess the basic knowledge that is necessary to understand even common physical phenomena. And not enough are able to form their own substantiated opinions about them. What will happen during \"Physics on Stage\"? During the first phase of \"Physics on Stage\", from now until October 2000, the individual national steering committees (NSC) will survey the situation in their respective countries. The NSCs will collaborate with national media to identify new and exciting educational approaches to physics. These may involve demonstrations, interactive experiments, video and CD-Rom presentations, web applications, virtual reality, theatre performances, etc. Nationally run competitions will select some of the best and most convincing new ideas for presentations and educational materials which will receive development support from \"Physics on Stage\". The project will culminate in November 2000, with approximately 400 delegates converging on CERN, in Geneva, for the \"Physics on Stage\" conference. The conference will enable the national competition winners, science teachers, science communicators, publishers, top scientists and high-level representatives of the ministries and European organisations to brainstorm solutions to bolster physics' popularity. The programme will also include spectacular demonstrations of educational tools; the best will be disseminated over the national TV networks and other media to the European public. Why ESA, CERN, and ESO? As Europe's principal organisations in physics research (particle physics, space and astronomy), the three recognised their mutual responsibility to address the issue with the launch of a new initiative and the creative use of their own research to attract the attention of the general public and teachers alike. About the \"European Science and Technology Week\" The objective of the \"European Science and Technology Week\" is to improve the public's knowledge and understanding of science and technology - including the associated benefits for society as a whole. The week focuses on the European dimension of research, such as pan-European scientific and technological co-operation. The rationale for holding the Week has its roots in the importance of the role of science and technology in modern societies and the need therefore, to ensure that the public recognises its significance in our lives. The Week is a framework for special TV programmes, exhibitions, contests, conferences, electronic networking, and other science related activities to promote the public understanding of science and technology. The Week was launched in 1993, on the initiative of the European Commission. Raising public awareness of science and technology is now the subject of a clearly defined action within the Human Potential Programme of the Fifth Framework Programme. Notes [1] The same press release is published also by CERN and ESO. [2] The 22 countries are the member countries of at least one of the participating organisations or the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. Statements by the Directors General of ESA, CERN, and ESO Antonio RodotÃ (ESA): \"Space has become an integral part of every day life. The immense technological development that has led to this achievement has taken place and might be taken for granted. But now is the time to follow up and form the future on this basis, a future that has to be made by the youth and has to give its benefits to the youth. The European Space Agency is dedicated to support the youth in its development to become a space generation. Many activities have been done and are taking place, and many more are planned for the future. Teachers and educational institutions and organisations form a key role in this development. ESA is enthusiastic about co-operating with ESO, CERN and the European Union to create an opportunity to receive ideas from the educational society and will perform a dedicated effort in finding ways to support the realisation of those ideas.\" Luciano Maiani (CERN): \"Science is a critical resource for mankind and, among natural sciences, physics will continue to play a crucial role, well into the next century. The young people of Europe deserve the best possible physics teaching. An enormous resource of first class teachers, teaching materials and innovative thinking exists in our Countries. The \"Physics on Stage\" project will bring these together to generate a new interest in physics education which will be to the long term benefit of children all over Europe. CERN is delighted to take part in this collaboration between the European Community and the continent's three leading physics research organisations.\" Catherine Cesarsky (ESO): \"Astronomy and Astrophysics are at the very heart of modern physics. As vibrant research disciplines they use the most advanced technology available to humanity to explore Cosmos. It is also a science of extreme conditions - the largest distances, the longest periods of time, the highest temperatures, the strongest electrical and magnetic fields, the highest and lowest densities and the most extreme energies. Cosmos is indeed the greatest physics laboratory. For years, ESO - Europe's Astronomy Organisation - has been engaged in communicating the outcome of the exciting research programmes carried out at the ESO observatories to a wide audience and in particular to Europe's youth. I warmly welcome the broad international collaboration within \"Physics on Stage\". I am confident that working together with the European Union and our sister organisations ESA and CERN, as well as teachers' organisations and dedicated individuals in all member countries, this innovative education programme will make a most important contribution towards raising the interest in fundamental research in Europe.\" About ESA, CERN, and ESO The European Space Agency (ESA) is an international/intergovernmental organisation made of 15 member states: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

OPERA - First Beam Results DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Nakamura, M. 2008-02-21 OPERA is a long base-line neutrino oscillation experiment to detect tau-neutrino appearance and to prove that the origin of the atmospheric muon neutrino deficit observed by Kamiokande is the neutrino oscillation. A Hybrid emulsion detector, of which weight is about 1.3 kton, has been installed in Gran Sasso laboratory. New muon neutrino beam line, CNGS, has been constructed at CERN to send neutrinos to Gran Sasso, 730 km apart from CERN. In 2006, first neutrinos were sent from CERN to LNGS and were detected by the OPERA detector successfully as planned.

Software Aspects of IEEE Floating-Point Computations for Numerical Applications in High Energy Physics ScienceCinema Arnold, Jeffrey 2018-05-14 Floating-point computations are at the heart of much of the computing done in high energy physics. The correctness, speed and accuracy of these computations are of paramount importance. The lack of any of these characteristics can mean the difference between new, exciting physics and an embarrassing correction. This talk will examine practical aspects of IEEE 754-2008 floating-point arithmetic as encountered in HEP applications. After describing the basic features of IEEE floating-point arithmetic, the presentation will cover: common hardware implementations (SSE, x87) techniques for improving the accuracy of summation, multiplication and data interchange compiler options for gcc and icc affecting floating-point operations hazards to be avoided. About the speaker: Jeffrey M Arnold is a Senior Software Engineer in the Intel Compiler and Languages group at Intel Corporation. He has been part of the Digital->Compaq->Intel compiler organization for nearly 20 years; part of that time, he worked on both low- and high-level math libraries. Prior to that, he was in the VMS Engineering organization at Digital Equipment Corporation. In the late 1980s, Jeff spent 2ÃÂ½ years at CERN as part of the CERN/Digital Joint Project. In 2008, he returned to CERN to spent 10 weeks working with CERN/openlab. Since that time, he has returned to CERN multiple times to teach at openlab workshops and consult with various LHC experiments.

HST at CERN an Amazing Adventure NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Restivo, Evelyn 2009-04-01 The High School Teacher Program (HST) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland was initiated in 1998 by a group of scientists, as a multicultural international program designed to introduce high school physics teachers to high-energy physics. The goal of the program is to provide experiences and materials that will help teachers lead their students to a better understanding of the physical world. Interacting with physics teachers from around the world leads to new approaches for dealing with educational issues that all teachers encounter. The program includes a variety of tours, a series of lectures and classroom activities about the physics expected from the Large Hadron Collider.

Physics Division 2018-01-12 Summer Lecture Series 2007: Michael Barnett of Berkeley Lab's Physics Division discusses the ATLAS Experiment at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics' (CERN) Large Hadron Collider. The collider will explore the aftermath of collisions at the highest energy ever produced in the lab, and will recreate the conditions of the universe a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. The ATLAS detector is half the size of the Notre Dame Cathedral and required 2000 physicists and engineers from 35 countries for its construction. Its goals are to examine mini-black holes, identify dark matter, understand antimatter, search for extra dimensions of space, and learn about the fundamental forces that have shaped the universe since the beginning of time and will determine its fate. New directions in the CernVM file system NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Blomer, Jakob; Buncic, Predrag; Ganis, Gerardo; Hardi, Nikola; Meusel, Rene; Popescu, Radu 2017-10-01 The CernVM File System today is commonly used to host and distribute application software stacks. In addition to this core task, recent developments expand the scope of the file system into two new areas. Firstly, CernVM-FS emerges as a good match for container engines to distribute the container image contents. Compared to native container image distribution (e.g. through the âDocker registryâ), CernVM-FS massively reduces the network traffic for image distribution. This has been shown, for instance, by a prototype integration of CernVM-FS into Mesos developed by Mesosphere, Inc. We present a path for a smooth integration of CernVM-FS and Docker. Secondly, CernVM-FS recently raised new interest as an option for the distribution of experiment conditions data. Here, the focus is on improved versioning capabilities of CernVM-FS that allows to link the conditions data of a run period to the state of a CernVM-FS repository. Lastly, CernVM-FS has been extended to provide a name space for physics data for the LIGO and CMS collaborations. Searching through a data namespace is often done by a central, experiment specific database service. A name space on CernVM-FS can particularly benefit from an existing, scalable infrastructure and from the POSIX file system interface. CERN, ESA and ESO Launch \"Physics On Stage\" NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 2000-03-01 Physics is everywhere . The laws of physics govern the Universe, the Sun, the Earth and even our own lives. In today's rapidly developing society, we are becoming increasingly dependent on high technology - computers, transport, and communication are just some of the key areas that are the result of discoveries by scientists working in physics. But how much do the citizens of Europe really know about physics? Here is a unique opportunity to learn more about this elusive subject! [Go to Physics On Stage Website] Beginning in February 2000, three major European research organisations are organising a unique Europe-wide programme to raise the public awareness of physics and related sciences. \"Physics on Stage\" is launched by the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) , the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) , with support from the European Union. Other partners are the European Physical Society (EPS) and the European Association for Astronomy Education (EAAE). This exciting programme is part of the European Week for Science and Technology and will culminate in a Science Festival during November 6-11, 2000, on the CERN premises at the French-Swiss border near Geneva. Why \"Physics on Stage\"? The primary goal of \"Physics on Stage\" is to counteract the current decline in interest and knowledge about physics among Europe's citizens by means of a series of highly visible promotional activities. It will bring together leading scientists and educators, government bodies and the media, to confront the diminishing attraction of physics to young people and to develop strategies to reverse this trend. The objective in the short term is to infuse excitement and to provide new educational materials. In the longer term, \"Physics on Stage\" will generate new developments by enabling experts throughout Europe to meet, exchange and innovate. \"Physics on Stage\" in 22 European Countries \"Physics on Stage\" has been initiated in 22 European countries [2]. In each of these, a dedicated National Steering Committee is being formed which will be responsible for its own national programme. A list of contact addresses is attached below. \"Physics on Stage\" is based on a series of high-profile physics-related activities that will inform the European public in general and European high school physics teachers and media representatives in particular about innovative ways to convey information about physics. It will stress the intimate connection of this natural science with our daily lives. It will be accompanied by a broad media debate on these subjects. This effort is undertaken in the context of a progressive decline of physics literacy amongst the European population at all levels. Fewer and fewer young people are attracted towards careers in core sciences and technologies - this could potentially lead to a crisis in European technology in the coming decades unless action is taken now. Too few people possess the basic knowledge that is necessary to understand even common physical phenomena. And not enough are able to form their own substantiated opinions about them. What will happen during \"Physics on Stage\"? During the first phase of \"Physics on Stage\" , from now until October 2000, the individual National Steering Committees (NSCs) will survey the situation in their respective countries. The NSCs will collaborate with national media to identify new and exciting educational approaches to physics. These may involve demonstrations, interactive experiments, video and CD-Rom presentations, Web applications, virtual reality, theatre performances, etc. Nationally run competitions will select some of the best and most convincing new ideas for presentations and educational materials which will receive development support from \"Physics on Stage\" . The project will culminate in November 2000, with approximately 400 delegates converging on CERN, in Geneva, for the Physics on Stage Festival . During this event, the national competion winners, science teachers, science communicators, publishers, top scientists and high-level representatives of the ministries and European organisations will brainstorm future solutions to bolster physics' popularity. The programme will also include spectacular demonstrations of new educational tools; the best will be disseminated over the national TV networks and other media to the European public. Why CERN, ESA and ESO? As Europe's principal organisations in physics research (particle physics, space and astronomy), the three recognised their mutual responsibility to address the issue through the creation of a new initiative and the creative use of their own research to attract the public and teachers alike. About the \"European Science and Technology Week\" [Go to EWST Website] The objective of the European Science and Technology Week is to improve the public's knowledge and understanding of science and technology - including the associated benefits for society as a whole. The Week focuses on the European dimension of research, such as pan-European scientific and technological co-operation. The rationale for holding the Week has its roots in the importance of the role of science and technology in modern societies and the need, therefore, to ensure that the public recognises its significance in our lives. The Week is a framework for special TV programmes, exhibitions, contests, conferences, electronic networking, and other science related activities to promote the public understanding of science and technology. The Week was launched in 1993, on the initiative of the European Commission. Raising public awareness of science and technology is now the subject of a clearly defined action within the Human Potential Programme of the Fifth Framework Programme. Notes [1] This is a joint Press Release by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) , the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO).

Statements by the Directors General of CERN, ESA and ESO Luciano Maiani (CERN) : \"Science is a critical resource for mankind and, among natural sciences, physics will continue to play a crucial role, well into the next century. The young people of Europe deserve the best possible physics teaching. An enormous resource of first class teachers, teaching materials and innovative thinking exists in our countries. The \"Physics on Stage\" project will bring these together to generate a new interest in physics education which will be to the long term benefit of children all over Europe. CERN is delighted to take part in this collaboration between the European Community and the continent's three leading physics research organizations.\" Antonio RodotÃ (ESA) : \"Space has become an integral part of every day life. The immense technological development that has led to this achievement has taken place and might be taken for granted. But now is the time to follow up and form the future on this basis, a future that has to made by the youth and has to give its benefits to the youth. The European Space Agency is dedicated to support the youth in its development to become a space generation. Many activities have been done and are taking place, and many more are planned for the future. Teachers and educational institutions and organisations form a key role in this development. ESA is enthusiastic about co-operating with ESO and CERN to create an opportunity to receiving ideas from the educational society and will perform a dedicated effort in finding ways to support the realisation of those ideas.\" Catherine Cesarsky (ESO) : \"Astronomy and Astrophysics are at the very heart of modern physics. As vibrant research disciplines they use the most advanced technology available to humanity to explore Cosmos. It is also a science of extreme conditions - the largest distances, the longest periods of time, the highest temperatures, the strongest electrical and magnetic fields, the highest and lowest densities and the most extreme energies. Cosmos is indeed the greatest physics laboratory. For years, ESO - Europe's Astronomy Organisation - has been engaged in communicating the outcome of the exciting research programmes carried out at the ESO observatories to a wide audience and in particular to Europe's youth. I warmly welcome the broad international collaboration within \"Physics on Stage\". I am confident that working together with the European Union and our sister organisations ESA and CERN, as well as teachers' organisations and dedicated individuals in all member countries, this innovative education programme will make a most important contribution towards raising the interest in fundamental research in Europe.\" About CERN, ESA and ESO CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research , has its headquarters in Geneva.

This information is a living material, evolving in time, following specific lifecycles. It has to reach the next generations of engineers so they understand how their predecessors designed, crafted, operated and maintained the most complex machines ever built. This is the role of CERN EDMS. The Engineering and Equipment Data Management Service has served the High Energy Physics Community for over 15 years. It is CERN's official PLM (Product Lifecycle Management), supporting engineering communities in their collaborations inside and outside the laboratory. EDMS is integrated with the CAD (Computer-aided Design) and CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management) systems used at CERN providing tools for engineers who work in different domains and who are not PLM specialists. Over the years, human collaborations and machines grew in size and complexity. So did EDMS: it is currently home to more than 2 million files and documents, and has over 6 thousand active users. In April 2014 we released a new major version of EDMS, featuring a complete makeover of the web interface, improved responsiveness and enhanced functionality. Following the results of user surveys and building upon feedback received from key users group, we brought what we think is a system that is more attractive and makes it easy to perform complex tasks. In this paper we will describe the main functions and the architecture of EDMS. We will discuss the available integration options, which enable further evolution and automation of engineering data management. We will also present our plans for the future development of EDMS.

The NA62 experiment at CERN SPS aims to collect and analyse O(1013) kaon decays before the CERN long-shutdown 2 (in 2018). This will allow to measure the branching ratio to a level of 10% accuracy. The experimental apparatus has been commissioned during a first run in autumn 2014. Space Radiation Effects Laboratory NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) 1969-01-01 The SREL User's Handbook is designed to provide information needed by those who plan experiments involving the accelerators at this laboratory. Thus the Handbook will contain information on the properties of the machines, the beam parameters, the facilities and services provided for experimenters, etc. This information will be brought up to date as new equipment is added and modifications accomplished. This Handbook is influenced by the many excellent models prepared at other accelerator laboratories. In particular, the CERN Synchrocyclotron User's Handbook (November 1967) is closely followed in some sections, since the SREL Synchrocyclotron is a duplicate of the CERN machine. We wish to thank Dr. E. G. Michaelis for permission to draw so heavily on his work, particularly in Section II of this Handbook. We hope that the Handbook will prove useful, and will welcome suggestions and criticism. Physics in the Spotlight NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 2000-10-01 CERN, ESA and ESO Put Physics On Stage [1] Summary Can you imagine how much physics is in a simple match of ping-pong, in throwing a boomerang, or in a musical concert? Physics is all around us and governs our lives. The World-Wide Web and mobile communication are only two examples of technologies that have rapidly found their way from science into the everyday life. [Go to Physics On Stage Website at CERN] But who is going to maintain these technologies and develop new ones in the future? Probably not young Europeans, as recent surveys show a frightening decline of interest in physics and technology among Europe's citizens, especially schoolchildren. Fewer and fewer young people enrol in physics courses at university. The project \"Physics on Stage\" tackles this problem head on. An international festival of 400 physics educators from 22 European countries [2] gather at CERN in Geneva from 6 to 10 November to show how fascinating and entertaining physics can be . In a week-long event innovative methods of teaching physics and demonstrations of the fun that lies in physics are presented in a fair, in 10 spectacular performances, and presentations. Workshops on 14 key themes will give the delegates - teachers, professors, artists and other physics educators - the chance to discuss and come up with solutions for the worrying situation of disenchantment with Science in Europe. The European Science and Technology Week 2000 \"Physics on Stage\" is a joint project organised by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) , the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) , Europe's leading physics research organisations. This is the first time that these three organisations have worked together in such close collaboration to catalyse a change in attitude towards science and technology education. Physics on Stage is funded in part by the European Commission and happens as an event in the European Science and Technology Week 2000, an initiative of the EC to raise public awareness of science and technology. Other partners are the European Physical Society (EPS) and the European Association for Astronomy Education (EAAE). European Commissioner Busquin to Visit Physics On Stage On Thursday, November 9, Philippe Busquin , Commissioner for Research, European Commission, Prof. Luciano Maiani , Director-General of CERN, Antonio Rodota , Director-General of ESA, Dr. Catherine Cesarsky , Director-General of ESO, and Dr. Achilleas Mitsos , Director-General of the Research DG in the European Commission, will participate in the activities of the Physics on Stage Festival. On this occasion, Commissioner Busquin will address conference delegates and the Media on the importance of Science and of innovative science and technology education. The Festival Each of the more than 400 delegates of the festival has been selected during the course of the year by committees in each of the 22 countries for outstanding projects promoting science. For example, a group of Irish physics teachers and their students will give a concert on instruments made exclusively of plumbing material, explaining the physics of sound at the same time. A professional theatre company from Switzerland stages a play on antimatter. Or two young Germans invite spectators to their interactive physics show where they juggle, eat fire and perform stunning physics experiments on stage. The colourful centrepiece of this week is the Physics Fair. Every country has its own stands where delegates show their projects, programmes or experiments and gain inspiration from the exhibits from other countries. Physics on Stage is a unique event. Nothing like it has ever happened in terms of international exchange, international collaboration and state of the art science and technology education methods. The Nobel prizewinners of 2030 are at school today. What ideas can Europe's teachers put forward to boost their interest in science? An invitation to the media We invite journalists to take part in this both politically and visually interesting event. We expect many useful results from this exchange of experience, there will a large choice of potential interview partners and of course uncountable images and impressions.

Physics Division progress report, January 1, 1984-September 30, 1986 DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Keller, W.E. 1987-10-01 This report provides brief accounts of significant progress in development activities and research results achieved by Physics Division personnel during the period January 1, 1984, through September 31, 1986. These efforts are representative of the three main areas of experimental research and development in which the Physics Division serves Los Alamos National Laboratory's and the Nation's needs in defense and basic sciences: (1) defense physics, including the development of diagnostic methods for weapons tests, weapon-related high-energy-density physics, and programs supporting the Strategic Defense Initiative; (2) laser physics and applications, especially to high-density plasmas; and (3) fundamental research in nuclear andmoreÂ Â» particle physics, condensed-matter physics, and biophysics. Throughout the report, emphasis is placed on the design, construction, and application of a variety of advanced, often unique, instruments and instrument systems that maintain the Division's position at the leading edge of research and development in the specific fields germane to its mission. A sampling of experimental systems of particular interest would include the relativistic electron-beam accelerator and its applications to high-energy-density plasmas; pulsed-power facilities; directed energy weapon devices such as free-electron lasers and neutral-particle-beam accelerators; high-intensity ultraviolet and x-ray beam lines at the National Synchrotron Light Source (at Brookhaven National Laboratory); the Aurora KrF ultraviolet laser system for projected use as an inertial fusion driver; antiproton physics facility at CERN; and several beam developments at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility for studying nuclear, condensed-matter, and biological physics, highlighted by progress in establishing the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center.Â«Â less The ALICE Pixel Detector NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mercado-Perez, Jorge 2002-07-01 The present document is a brief summary of the performed activities during the 2001 Summer Student Programme at CERN under the Scientific Summer at Foreign Laboratories Program organized by the Particles and Fields Division of the Mexican Physical Society (Sociedad Mexicana de Fisica).

CERN and 60 years of science for peace DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Heuer, Rolf-Dieter, E-mail: Rolf.Heuer@cern.ch 2015-02-24 This paper presents CERN as it celebrates its 60{sup th} Anniversary since its founding. The presentation first discusses the mission of CERN and its role as an inter-governmental Organization. The paper also reviews aspects of the particle physics research programme, looking at both current and future accelerator-based facilities at the high-energy and intensity frontiers. Finally, the paper considers issues beyond fundamental research, such as capacity-building and the interface between Art and Science. CERN goes iconic NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 2017-06-01 There are more than 1800 emoji that can be sent and received in text messages and e-mails. Now, the CERN particle-physics lab near Geneva has got in on the act and released its own collection of 35 images that can be used by anyone with an Apple device. \"Infinitos\" NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 1994-04-01 On Friday, 22 April 1994, a new science exhibition ``Infinitos\", arranged jointly by Lisboa'94, CERN and ESO, will open at the Museu de Electricidade on the waterfront of Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. In a series of spectacular displays, it illustrates man's current understanding of how the Universe works - from the tiniest structures of matter to the most far flung galaxies. On this day, it will be inaugurated by the President of Lisboa'94, Prof. Vitor Constancio, the Portuguese Science Minister, Prof. L. Valente de Oliveira, Prof. C. Llewellyn Smith, Director General of CERN [2] and Dr. P. Creola, President of ESO Council. This exhibition is part of a rich cultural programme taking place at Lisbon during 1994 in the frame of ``Lisboa 94 - European City of Culture\", after which it will travel to major cities around Europe. The frontiers of our knowledge push into inner space - the structure of the smallest components of matter - and into outer space - the dramatic phenomena of distant galaxies. Two of Europe's leading science organisations are playing a crucial role in this great human adventure. The European Laboratory for Particle Physics, CERN, operates the mighty accelerators and colliding beam machines to penetrate deep into matter and recreate the conditions which prevailed in the Universe a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang. The European Southern Observatory, ESO, operates the largest optical observatory in the world with a range of advanced telescopes searching the sky to study the evolution and content of our Universe. The ``Infinitos'' exhibition uses many modern exhibition techniques, including sophisticated audio-visual presentations and interactive video programmes. Visitors enter through a gallery of portraits of the most celebrated scientists from the 16th to 20th centuries and an exhibition of art inspired by scientific research. After passing a cosmic ray detector showing the streams of particles which pour down constantly from outer space, visitors continue into a central area where they are confronted with the essential questions of astro- and particle physics, f.inst. ``What is the Universe made of?'', ``How was the Universe created?'', ``What is in the sky?'', ``What is Dark Matter?'', ``Where does the stuff in our bodies come from?'', and ``Are we alone in the Universe?'' A central theme of this display is ``What we don't know''. In the second part of the exhibition visitors are shown the instruments and techniques used in today's big science research which will help to provide the answers. There are special displays on Europe's future large research projects such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, which will bring protons into head-on collision at higher energies (14 TeV) than ever before to allow scientists to penetrate still further into the structure of matter and recreate the conditions prevailing in the Universe just 10-12 seconds after the \"Big Bang\" when the temperature was 10^16 degrees. Another highlight is a large interactive model of ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), the world's most ambitious optical telescope project, now under construction. The telescope's unequalled potential for exciting astronomical observations at the outer reaches of the Universe is clearly explained. Special emphasis is given to the contribution of Portuguese research institutes to the work of CERN and ESO, and particle physicists and astronomers from Portugal will be present at the exhibition to talk to visitors about their work. This exhibition will remain open until 12 June 1994 and will be a major attraction, also to the many tourists visiting this year's European City of Culture. 1.

OBITUARY: Maurice Jacob (1933 2007) NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Quercigh, Emanuele; Å Ã¡ndor, Ladislav 2008-04-01 Maurice Jacob passed away on 2 May 2007. With his death, we have lost one of the founding fathers of the ultra-relativistic heavy ion programme. His interest in high-energy nuclear physics started in 1981 when alpha alpha collisions could first be studied in the CERN ISR. An enthusiastic supporter of ion beam experiments at CERN, Maurice was at the origin of the 1982 Quark Matter meeting in Bielefeld [1] which brought together more than 100 participants from both sides of the Atlantic, showing a good enthusiastic constituency for such research. There were twice as many the following year at Brookhaven. Finally in the mid-eighties, a heavy ion programme was approved both at CERN and at Brookhaven involving as many nuclear as particle physicists. It was the start of a fruitful interdisciplinary collaboration which is nowadays continuing both at RHIC and at LHC. Maurice followed actively the development of this field, reporting at a number of conferences and meetings (Les Arcs, Bielefeld, Beijing, Brookhaven, Lenox, Singapore, Taormina,...). This activity culminated in 2000, when Maurice, together with Ulrich Heinz, summarized the main results of the CERN SPS heavy-ion experiments and the evidence was obtained for a new state of matter [2]. Maurice was a brilliant theoretical physicist. His many contributions have been summarized in a recent article in the CERN Courier by two leading CERN theorists, John Ellis and Andre Martin [3]. The following is an excerpt from their article: `He began his research career at Saclay and, while still a PhD student, he continued brilliantly during a stay at Brookhaven. It was there in 1959 that Maurice, together with Giancarlo Wick, developed the helicity amplitude formalism that is the basis of many modern theoretical calculations. Maurice obtained his PhD in 1961 and, after a stay at Caltech, returned to Saclay. A second American foray was to SLAC, where he and Sam Berman made the crucial observation that the point-like structures (partons) seen in deep-inelastic scattering implied the existence of high-transverse-momentum processes in proton proton collisions, as the ISR at CERN subsequently discovered. In 1967 Maurice joined CERN, where he remained, apart from influential visits to Yale, Fermilab and elsewhere, until his retirement in 1998. He became one of the most respected international experts on the phenomenology of strong interactions, including diffraction, scaling, high-transverse-momentum processes and the formation of quark gluon plasma. In particular, he pioneered the studies of inclusive hadron-production processes, including scaling and its violations. Also, working with Ron Horgan, he made detailed predictions for the production of jets at CERN's proton antiproton collider. The UA2 and UA1 experiments subsequently discovered these. He was also interested in electron positron colliders, making pioneering calculations, together with Tai Wu, of radiation in high-energy collisions. Maurice was one of the scientific pillars of CERN, working closely with experimental colleagues in predicting and interpreting results from successive CERN colliders. He was indefatigable in organizing regular meetings on ISR physics, bringing together theorists and experimentalists to debate the meaning of new results and propose new measurements. He was one of the strongest advocates of Carlo Rubbia's proposal for a proton antiproton collider at CERN, and was influential in preparing and advertising its physics. In 1978 he organized the Les Houches workshop that brought the LEP project to the attention of the wider European particle physics community. He also organized the ECFA workshop at Lausanne in 1984 that made the first exploration of the possible physics of the LHC. It is a tragedy that Maurice has not lived to enjoy data from the LHC.'

The 2010 edition of the school is supported and organized by the CERN Theory Divison, and will take place from Monday January 25 to Friday January 29, at CERN. As its predecessors, this school is meant primarily for training of doctoral students and young postdoctoral researchers in recent developments in theoretical high-energy physics and string theory. The programme of the school will consist of five series of pedagogical lectures, complemented by tutorial discussion sessions in the afternoons. Previous schools in this series were organized in 2005 at SISSA in Trieste, and in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 at CERN, Geneva. « 2 3 4 5 6 » « 3 4 5 6 7 » In AppreciationThe Depth and Breadth of John Bell's Physics NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Jackiw, Roman; Shimony, Abner This essay surveys the work of John Stewart Bell, one of the great physicists of the twentieth century. Section 1 is a brief biography, tracing his career from working-class origins and undergraduate training in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to research in accelerator and nuclear physics in the British national laboratories at Harwell and Malvern, to his profound research on elementary particle physics as a member of the Theory Group at CERN and his equally profound ``hobby'' of investigating the foundations of quantum mechanics. Section 2 concerns this hobby, which began in his discontent with Bohr's and Heisenberg's analyses of the measurement process. He was attracted to the program of hidden variables interpretations, but he revolutionized the foundations of quantum mechanics by a powerful negative result: that no hidden variables theory that is ``local'' (in a clear and well-motivated sense) can agree with all the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics regarding well-separated systems. He further deepened the foundations of quantum mechanics by penetrating conceptual analyses of results concerning measurement theory of von Neumann, de Broglie and Bohm, Gleason, Jauch and Piron, Everett, and Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber. Bell's work in particle theory (Section 3) began with a proof of the CPT theorem in his doctoral dissertation, followed by investigations of the phenomenology of CP-violating experiments. At CERN Bell investigated the commutation relations in current algebras from various standpoints. The failure of current algebra combined with partially conserved current algebra to permit the experimentally observed decay of the neutral pi-meson into two photons stimulated the discovery by Bell and Jackiw of anomalous or quantal symmetry breaking, which has numerous implications for elementary particle phenomena. Other late investigations of Bell on elementary particle physics were bound states in quantum chromodynamics (in collaboration with Bertlmann) and estimates for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (in collaboration with de Rafael). Section 4 concerns accelerations, starting at Harwell with the algebra of strong focusing and the stability of orbits in linear accelerators and synchrotrons. At CERN he continued to contribute to accelerator physics, and with his wife Mary Bell he wrote on electron cooling and Beamstrahlung. A spectacular late achievement in accelerator physics was the demonstration (in collaboration with Leinaas) that the effective black-body radiation seen by an accelerated observer in an electromagnetic vacuum - the ``Unruh effect''- had already been observed experimentally in the partial depolarization of electrons traversing circular orbits. Experience with procuring, deploying and maintaining hardware at remote co-location centre NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) BÃ¤rring, O.; Bonfillou, E.; Clement, B.; Coelho Dos Santos, M.; Dore, V.; Gentit, A.; Grossir, A.; Salter, W.; Valsan, L.; Xafi, A. 2014-05-01 In May 2012 CERN signed a contract with the Wigner Data Centre in Budapest for an extension to CERN's central computing facility beyond its current boundaries set by electrical power and cooling available for computing. The centre is operated as a remote co-location site providing rack-space, electrical power and cooling for server, storage and networking equipment acquired by CERN. The contract includes a 'remote-hands' services for physical handling of hardware (rack mounting, cabling, pushing power buttons, ...) and maintenance repairs (swapping disks, memory modules, ...). However, only CERN personnel have network and console access to the equipment for system administration. This report gives an insight to adaptations of hardware architecture, procurement and delivery procedures undertaken enabling remote physical handling of the hardware. We will also describe tools and procedures developed for automating the registration, burn-in testing, acceptance and maintenance of the equipment as well as an independent but important change to the IT assets management (ITAM) developed in parallel as part of the CERN IT Agile Infrastructure project. Finally, we will report on experience from the first large delivery of 400 servers and 80 SAS JBOD expansion units (24 drive bays) to Wigner in March 2013.

Cryogenic Control System Migration and Developments towards the UNICOS CERN Standard at INFN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Modanese, Paolo; Calore, Andrea; Contran, Tiziano; Friso, Alessandro; Pengo, Marco; Canella, Stefania; Burioli, Sergio; Gallese, Benedetto; Inglese, Vitaliano; Pezzetti, Marco; Pengo, Ruggero The cryogenic control systems at Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (LNL) are undergoing an important and radical modernization, allowing all the plants controls and supervision systems to be renewed in a homogeneous way towards the CERN-UNICOS standard. Before the UNICOS migration project started there were as many as 7 different types of PLC and 7 different types of SCADA, each one requiring its own particular programming language. In these conditions, even a simple modification and/or integration on the program or on the supervision, required the intervention of a system integrator company, specialized in its specific control system. Furthermore it implied that the operators have to be trained to learn the different types of control systems. The CERN-UNICOS invented for LHC [1] has been chosen due to its reliability and planned to run and be maintained for decades on. The complete migration is part of an agreement between CERN and INFN. PREFACE: Lectures from the CERN Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories, CERN, 9-13 February 2009 Lectures from the CERN Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories, CERN, 9-13 February 2009 NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Uranga, A. M. 2009-11-01 This special section is devoted to the proceedings of the conference `Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories', which took place at CERN, the European Centre for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzerland 9-13 February 2009. This event is part of a yearly series of scientific schools, which represents a well established tradition. Previous events have been held at SISSA, in Trieste, Italy, in February 2005 and at CERN in January 2006, January 2007 and January 2008, and were funded by the European Mobility Research and Training Network `Constituents, Fundamental Forces and Symmetries of the Universe'. The next event will take place again at CERN, in January 2010. The school was primarily meant for young doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers working in the area of string theory. It consisted of several general lectures of four hours each, whose notes are published in this special section, and six working group discussion sessions, focused on specific topics of the network research program. It was well attended by over 200 participants. The topics of the lectures were chosen to provide an introduction to some of the areas of recent progress, and to the open problems, in string theory. One of the most active areas in string theory in recent years has been the AdS/CFT or gauge/gravity correspondence, which proposes the complete equivalence of string theory on (asymptotically) anti de Sitter spacetimes with certain quantum (gauge) field theories. The duality has recently been applied to understanding the hydrodynamical properties of a hot plasma in gauge theories (like the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions at the RHIC experiment at Brookhaven, and soon at the LHC at CERN) in terms of a dual gravitational AdS theory in the presence of a black hole. These developments were reviewed in the lecture notes by M Rangamani. In addition, the AdS/CFT duality has been proposed as a tool to study interesting physical properties in other physical systems described by quantum field theory, for instance in the context of a condensed matter system. The lectures by S Hartnoll provided an introduction to this recent development with an emphasis on the dual holographic description of superconductivity. Finally, ideas inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence are yielding deep insights into fundamental questions of quantum gravity, like the entropy of black holes and its interpretation in terms of microstates. The lectures by S Mathur reviewed the black hole entropy and information paradox, and the proposal for its resolution in terms of `fuzzball' microstates. Further sets of lectures, not included in this special section, by F Zwirner and V Mukhanov, covered phenomenological aspects of high energy physics beyond the Standard Model and of cosmology. The coming experimental data in these two fields are expected to foster new developments in connecting string theory to the real world. The conference was financially supported by CERN and partially by the Arnold Sommerfeld Center for Theoretical Physics of the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich. It is a great pleasure for us to warmly thank the Theory Unit of CERN for its very kind hospitality and for the high quality of the assistance and the infrastructures that it has provided.

In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol formation by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleation involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day atmosphere.

More \"Hands-On\" Particle Physics: Learning with ATLAS at CERN ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Long, Lynne 2011-01-01 This article introduces teachers and students to a new portal of resources called Learning with ATLAS at CERN (http://learningwithatlas-portal.eu/), which has been developed by a European consortium of academic researchers and schools' liaison and outreach providers from countries across Europe. It includes the use of some of the mind-bogglingâ¦ The FLUKA Code: An Overview NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Ballarini, F.; Battistoni, G.; Campanella, M.; Carboni, M.; Cerutti, F.; Empl, A.; Fasso, A.; Ferrari, A.; Gadioli, E.; Garzelli, M. V.; 2006-01-01 FLUKA is a multipurpose Monte Carlo code which can transport a variety of particles over a wide energy range in complex geometries. The code is a joint project of INFN and CERN: part of its development is also supported by the University of Houston and NASA. FLUKA is successfully applied in several fields, including but not only, particle physics, cosmic ray physics, dosimetry, radioprotection, hadron therapy, space radiation, accelerator design and neutronics. The code is the standard tool used at CERN for dosimetry, radioprotection and beam-machine interaction studies. Here we give a glimpse into the code physics models with a particular emphasis to the hadronic and nuclear sector. The trigger system for K0â2 Ï0 decays of the NA48 experiment at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mikulec, I. 1998-02-01 A fully pipelined 40 MHz \"dead-time-free\" trigger system for neutral K0 decays for the NA48 experiment at CERN is described. The NA48 experiment studies CP-violation using the high intensity beam of the CERN SPS accelerator. The trigger system sums, digitises, filters and processes signals from 13â340 channels of the liquid krypton electro-magnetic calorimeter. In 1996 the calorimeter and part of the trigger electronics were installed and tested. In 1997 the system was completed and prepared to be used in the first NA48 physics data taking period.

Progress report on nuclear spectroscopic studies DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Bingham, C.R.; Guidry, M.W.; Riedinger, L.L. 1994-02-18 The Nuclear Physics group at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) is involved in several aspects of heavy-ion physics including both nuclear structure and reaction mechanisms. While the main emphasis is on experimental problems, the authors have maintained a strong collaboration with several theorists in order to best pursue the physics of their measurements. During the last year they have had several experiments at the ATLAS at Argonne National Laboratory, the GAMMASPHERE at the LBL 88 Cyclotron, and with the NORDBALL at the Niels Bohr Institute Tandem. Also, they continue to be very active in the WA93/98 collaboration studying ultra-relativisticmoreÂ Â» heavy ion physics utilizing the SPS accelerator at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland and in the PHENIX Collaboration at the RHIC accelerator under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory. During the last year their experimental work has been in three broad areas: (1) the structure of nuclei at high angular momentum, (2) the structure of nuclei far from stability, and (3) ultra-relativistic heavy-ion physics. The results of studies in these particular areas are described in this document. These studies concentrate on the structure of nuclear matter in extreme conditions of rotational motion, imbalance of neutrons and protons, or very high temperature and density. Another area of research is heavy-ion-induced transfer reactions, which utilize the transfer of nucleons to states with high angular momentum to learn about their structure and to understand the transfer of particles, energy, and angular momentum in collisions between heavy ions.Â«Â less Strange Particles and Heavy Ion Physics DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Bassalleck, Bernd; Fields, Douglas This very long-running grant has supported many experiments in nuclear and particle physics by a group from the University of New Mexico. The gamut of these experiments runs from many aspects of Strangeness Nuclear Physics, to rare Kaon decays, to searches for exotic Hadrons such as Pentaquark or H-Dibaryon, and finally to Spin Physics within the PHENIX collaboration at RHIC. These experiments were performed at a number of laboratories worldwide: first and foremost at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL), but also at CERN, KEK, and most recently at J-PARC. In this Final Technical Report we summarize progress and achievements for thismoreÂ Â» award since our last Progress Report, i.e. for the period of fall 2013 until the awardâs termination on November 30, 2015. The report consists of two parts, representing our two most recent experimental efforts, participation in the Nucleon Spin Physics program of the PHENIX experiment at RHIC, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at BNL â Task 1, led by Douglas Fields; and participation in several Strangeness Nuclear Physics experiments at J-PARC, the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Center in Tokai-mura, Japan â Task 2, led by Bernd Bassalleck.Â«Â less Hangout with CERN: a direct conversation with the public NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Rao, Achintya; Goldfarb, Steven; Kahle, Kate 2016-04-01 Hangout with CERN refers to a weekly, half-hour-long, topical webcast hosted at CERN. The aim of the programme is threefold: (i) to provide a virtual tour of various locations and facilities at CERN, (ii) to discuss the latest scientific results from the laboratory, and, most importantly, (iii) to engage in conversation with the public and answer their questions. For each ;episode;, scientists gather around webcam-enabled computers at CERN and partner institutes/universities, connecting to one another using the Google+ social network's ;Hangouts; tool. The show is structured as a conversation mediated by a host, usually a scientist, and viewers can ask questions to the experts in real time through a Twitter hashtag or YouTube comments. The history of Hangout with CERN can be traced back to ICHEP 2012, where several physicists crowded in front of a laptop connected to Google+, using a ;Hangout On Air; webcast to explain to the world the importance of the discovery of the Higgs-like boson, announced just two days before at the same conference. Hangout with CERN has also drawn inspiration from two existing outreach endeavours: (i) ATLAS Virtual Visits, which connected remote visitors with scientists in the ATLAS Control Room via video conference, and (ii) the Large Hangout Collider, in which CMS scientists gave underground tours via Hangouts to groups of schools and members of the public around the world. In this paper, we discuss the role of Hangout with CERN as a bi-directional outreach medium and an opportunity to train scientists in effective communication. Status and Roadmap of CernVM NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Berzano, D.; Blomer, J.; Buncic, P.; Charalampidis, I.; Ganis, G.; Meusel, R. 2015-12-01 Cloud resources nowadays contribute an essential share of resources for computing in high-energy physics. Such resources can be either provided by private or public IaaS clouds (e.g. OpenStack, Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine) or by volunteers computers (e.g. LHC@Home 2.0). In any case, experiments need to prepare a virtual machine image that provides the execution environment for the physics application at hand. The CernVM virtual machine since version 3 is a minimal and versatile virtual machine image capable of booting different operating systems. The virtual machine image is less than 20 megabyte in size. The actual operating system is delivered on demand by the CernVM File System. CernVM 3 has matured from a prototype to a production environment. It is used, for instance, to run LHC applications in the cloud, to tune event generators using a network of volunteer computers, and as a container for the historic Scientific Linux 5 and Scientific Linux 4 based software environments in the course of long-term data preservation efforts of the ALICE, CMS, and ALEPH experiments. We present experience and lessons learned from the use of CernVM at scale. We also provide an outlook on the upcoming developments. These developments include adding support for Scientific Linux 7, the use of container virtualization, such as provided by Docker, and the streamlining of virtual machine contextualization towards the cloud-init industry standard. A free-jet Hg target operating in a high magnetic field intersecting a high-power proton beam NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Graves, Van; Spampinato, Philip; Gabriel, Tony; Kirk, Harold; Simos, Nicholas; Tsang, Thomas; McDonald, Kirk; Peter Titus; Fabich, Adrian; Haseroth, Helmut; Lettry, Jacques 2006-06-01 A proof-of-principal experiment to investigate the interaction of a proton beam, high magnetic field, and high-Z target is planned to take place at CERN in early 2007. This experiment is part of the Muon Collider Collaboration, with participants from Brookhaven National Laboratory, Princeton University, Massachusetts Institute Of Technology, European Organization for Nuclear Research-CERN, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. An unconstrained mercury jet target system that interacts with a high power (1 MW) proton beam in a high magnetic field (15 T) is being designed. The Hg jet diameter is 1-cm with a velocity up to 20 m/s. A laser optical diagnostic system will be incorporated into the target design to permit observation of the dispersal of the jet resulting from interaction with a 24 GeV proton beam with up to 20Ã1012 ppp. The target system includes instruments for sensing mercury vapor, temperature, flow rate, and sump tank level, and the means to position the jet relative to the magnetic axis of a solenoid and the proton beam. The design considerations for the system include all issues dealing with safely handling approximately 23 l of Hg, transporting the target system and the mercury to CERN, decommissioning the experiment, and returning the mildly activated equipment and Hg to the US.

Comparison of electromagnetic and hadronic models generated using Geant 4 with antiproton dose measured in CERN. PubMed Tavakoli, Mohammad Bagher; Reiazi, Reza; Mohammadi, Mohammad Mehdi; Jabbari, Keyvan 2015-01-01 After proposing the idea of antiproton cancer treatment in 1984 many experiments were launched to investigate different aspects of physical and radiobiological properties of antiproton, which came from its annihilation reactions. One of these experiments has been done at the European Organization for Nuclear Research known as CERN using the antiproton decelerator. The ultimate goal of this experiment was to assess the dosimetric and radiobiological properties of beams of antiprotons in order to estimate the suitability of antiprotons for radiotherapy. One difficulty on this way was the unavailability of antiproton beam in CERN for a long time, so the verification of Monte Carlo codes to simulate antiproton depth dose could be useful. Among available simulation codes, Geant4 provides acceptable flexibility and extensibility, which progressively lead to the development of novel Geant4 applications in research domains, especially modeling the biological effects of ionizing radiation at the sub-cellular scale. In this study, the depth dose corresponding to CERN antiproton beam energy by Geant4 recruiting all the standard physics lists currently available and benchmarked for other use cases were calculated. Overall, none of the standard physics lists was able to draw the antiproton percentage depth dose. Although, with some models our results were promising, the Bragg peak level remained as the point of concern for our study. It is concluded that the Bertini model with high precision neutron tracking (QGSP_BERT_HP) is the best to match the experimental data though it is also the slowest model to simulate events among the physics lists. CERN@school: demonstrating physics with the Timepix detector NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Whyntie, T.; Bithray, H.; Cook, J.; Coupe, A.; Eddy, D.; Fickling, R. L.; McKenna, J.; Parker, B.; Paul, A.; Shearer, N. 2015-10-01 This article shows how the Timepix hybrid silicon pixel detector, developed by the Medipix2 Collaboration, can be used by students and teachers alike to demonstrate some key aspects of any well-rounded physics curriculum with CERN@school. After an overview of the programme, the detector's capabilities for measuring and visualising ionising radiation are examined. The classification of clusters - groups of adjacent pixels - is discussed with respect to identifying the different types of particles. Three demonstration experiments - background radiation measurements, radiation profiles and the attenuation of radiation - are described; these can used as part of lessons or as inspiration for independent research projects. Results for exemplar data-sets are presented for reference, as well as details of ongoing research projects inspired by these experiments. Interested readers are encouraged to join the CERN@school Collaboration and so contribute to achieving the programme's aim of inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers. DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) None The CERN Winter School on Supergravity, Strings, and Gauge Theory is the analytic continuation of the yearly training school of the former EC-RTN string network Constituents, Fundamental Forces and Symmetries of the Universe. The 2010 edition of the school is supported and organized by the CERN Theory Divison, and will take place from Monday January 25 to Friday January 29, at CERN. As its predecessors, this school is meant primarily for training of doctoral students and young postdoctoral researchers in recent developments in theoretical high-energy physics and string theory. The programme of the school will consist of five series ofmoreÂ Â» pedagogical lectures, complemented by tutorial discussion sessions in the afternoons. Previous schools in this series were organized in 2005 at SISSA in Trieste, and in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 at CERN, Geneva.Â«Â less PREFACE: High Energy Particle Physics Workshop (HEPPW2015) NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cornell, Alan S.; Mellado, B. 2015-10-01 The motivation for this workshop began with the discovery of the Higgs boson three years ago, and the realisation that many problems remain in particle physics, such as why there is more matter than anti-matter, better determining the still poorly measured parameters of the strong force, explaining possible sources for dark matter, naturalness etc. While the newly discovered Higgs boson seems to be compatible with the Standard Model, current experimental accuracy is far from providing a definitive statement with regards to the nature of this new particle. There is a lot of room for physics beyond the Standard Model to emerge in the exploration of the Higgs boson. Recent measurements in high-energy heavy ion collisions at the LHC have shed light on the complex dynamics that govern high-density quark-gluon interactions. An array of results from the ALICE collaboration have been highlighted in a recent issue of CERN courier. The physics program of high-energy heavy ion collisions promises to further unveil the intricacies of high-density quark-gluon plasma physics. The great topicality of high energy physics research has also seen a rapid increase in the number of researchers in South Africa pursuing such studies, both experimentally through the ATLAS and ALICE colliders at CERN, and theoretically. Young researchers and graduate students largely populate these research groups, with little experience in presenting their work, and few support structures (to their knowledge) to share experiences with. Whilst many schools and workshops have sought to educate these students on the theories and tools they will need to pursue their research, few have provided them with a platform to present their work. As such, this workshop discussed the various projects being pursued by graduate students and young researchers in South Africa, enabling them to develop networks for future collaboration and discussion. The workshop took place at the iThemba Laboratories - North facility, in Gauteng, from the 11th to the 13th of February 2015, where excellent conference facilities with outdoors and indoor tea areas for discussions and interactions were provided, along with a state-of-the-art remote access to the conference venue such that those who were unable to attend the workshop in person could also be present. The laboratory is located next door to the Wits Professional Development Hub (on the corner of Jan Smuts Avenue and Empire Road), which provided the catering for this workshop. A morning plenary session, followed 15+10 minute presentations, was the format across our three days. The topics covered being in high-energy theory and phenomenology (heavy ions, pp, ep, ee collisions), ATLAS physics and ALICE physics. The workshop website is http://hep.wits.ac.za/HEPPW2015.php Lectures from the European RTN Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Fields, CERN, 15 19 January 2007 NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Derendinger, J.-P.; Scrucca, C. A.; Uranga, A. 2007-11-01 This special issue is devoted to the proceedings of the conference 'Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories', which took place at CERN, the European Centre for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzerland, from the 15 to the 19 of January 2007. This event was organized in the framework of the European Mobility Research and Training Network entitled 'Constituents, Fundamental Forces and Symmetries of the Universe'. It is part of a yearly series of scientific schools, which represents what is by now a well established tradition. The previous conferences have been held at SISSA, in Trieste, Italy, in February 2005 and at CERN in January 2006. The next will again take place at CERN, in January 2008. The school was primarily meant for young doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers working in the area of string theory. It consisted of several general lectures of four hours each, the notes of which are published in the present proceedings, and seven working group discussion sessions, focused on specific topics of the network research program. It was attended by approximatively 250 participants. The topics of the lectures were chosen to provide an introduction to some of the areas of recent progress, and to the open problems, in string theory. String theory is a compelling candidate for a theory of all interactions. A basic challenge in this field is therefore to explore the connection of string theory models and the laws of physics in different realms, like high-energy particle physics, early cosmology, or physics of strongly coupled gauge theories. Concerning the exploration of string theory compactifications leading to realistic models of particle physics, one of the main obstacles in this direction is the proper understanding of supersymmetry breaking. The lecture notes by Nathan Seiberg review the realization of spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in field theory, including recent developments via the use of meta-stable long-lived vacua. It is possible that such an understanding proves crucial in the realization of supersymmetry breaking in string theory. A second long-standing obstacle, which is being tackled with recent techniques, is moduli stabilization, namely the removal of unwanted massless scalar fields from string models. The present status of this problem, and its prospects of solution via the introduction of general sets of fluxes in the compactification space, were covered in the lectures by Brian Wecht. Application of these ideas to connect string theory to particle physics will require a good understanding of the experimental situation at the forthcoming collider LHC at CERN, and the detection tools for signals of new physics, as reviewed in the lectures by Joe Lykken (not covered in the present issue). Along a different line, the role of moduli fields in string theory is expected to provide a natural explanation of models of inflation, and thus of the origin of the cosmological evolution of our universe. The lecture notes by Cliff Burgess provide a review of big bang cosmology, inflation, and its possible explanation in terms of string theory constructions, including some of the most recent results in the field (these notes also appear in the proceedings of two other schools held in the same period). A surprising recent application of string theory is the description, via the ideas of holography and duality between string theories and gauge theories, of physical properties of quantum chromodynamics at high temperature. Indeed experimental data on the physical properties of the quark gluon plasma, produced in heavy ion collision at the RHIC experiment in Brookhaven (and soon at the LHC at CERN) can be recovered, at a semi-quantitative level, from computations in a string theory dual of the system. These applications are reviewed in the lectures by David Mateos. The conference was financially supported by the European Commission under contract MRTN-CT-2004-005104 and by CERN. It was jointly organized by the Physics Institute of the University of NeuchÃ¢tel and the Theory Unit of the Physics Division of CERN. It is a great pleasure for us to warmly thank the Theory Unit of CERN for its very kind hospitality and for the high quality of the assistance and the infrastructures that it has provided. We also acknowledge helpful administrative assistance from the Physics Institute of the University of NeuchÃ¢tel. A special acknowledgement also goes to Denis Frank, for his very valuable help in preparing the conference web pages.

Preparation of a primary argon beam for the CERN fixed target physics. PubMed KÃ¼chler, D; O'Neil, M; Scrivens, R; Thomae, R 2014-02-01 The fixed target experiment NA61 in the North Area of the Super Proton Synchrotron is studying phase transitions in strongly interacting matter. Up to now they used the primary beams available from the CERN accelerator complex (protons and lead ions) or fragmented beams created from the primary lead ion beam. To explore a wider range of energies and densities a request was made to provide primary argon and xenon beams. This paper describes the results of the setting up and 10 week test run of the Ar(11+) beam from the 14.5 GHz ECR ion source and the linear accelerator (Linac3) at CERN. Quantum Optics, Diffraction Theory, and Elementary Particle Physics ScienceCinema Glauber, Roy 2018-05-22 Physical optics has expanded greatly in recent years. Though it remains part of the ancestry of elementary particle physics, there are once again lessons to be learned from it. I shall discuss several of these, including some that have emerged at CERN and Brookhaven. Design, construction and tests of a 3 GHz proton linac booster (LIBO) for cancer therapy NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Berra, Paolo 2007-12-01 In the last ten years the use of proton beams in radiation therapy has become a clinical tool for treatment of deep-seated tumours. LIBO is a RF compact and low cost proton linear accelerator (SCL type) for hadrontherapy. It is conceived by TERA Foundation as a 3 GHz Linac Booster, to be mounted downstream of an existing cyclotron in order to boost the energy of the proton beam up to 200 MeV, needed for deep treatment (~25 cm) in the human body. With this solution it is possible to transform a low energy commercial cyclotron, normally used for eye melanoma therapy, isotope production and nuclear physics research, into an accelerator for deep-seated tumours. A prototype module of LIBO has been built and successfully tested with full RF power at CERN and with proton beam at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (LNS) in Catania, within an international collaboration between TERA Foundation, CERN, the Universities and INFN groups of Milan and Naples. The mid-term aim of the project is the technology transfer of the accumulated know-how to a consortium of companies and to bring this novel medical tool to hospitals. The design, construction and tests of the LIBO prototype are described in detail. Protocols for Scholarly Communication NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Pepe, A.; Yeomans, J. 2007-10-01 CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, has operated an institutional preprint repository for more than 10 years. The repository contains over 850,000 records of which more than 450,000 are full-text OA preprints, mostly in the field of particle physics, and it is integrated with the library's holdings of books, conference proceedings, journals and other grey literature. In order to encourage effective propagation and open access to scholarly material, CERN is implementing a range of innovative library services into its document repository: automatic keywording, reference extraction, collaborative management tools and bibliometric tools. Some of these services, such as user reviewing and automatic metadata extraction, could make up an interesting testbed for future publishing solutions and certainly provide an exciting environment for e-science possibilities. The future protocol for scientific communication should guide authors naturally towards OA publication, and CERN wants to help reach a full open access publishing environment for the particle physics community and related sciences in the next few years. From Particle Physics to Medical Applications NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Dosanjh, Manjit 2017-06-01 CERN is the world's largest particle physics research laboratory. Since it was established in 1954, it has made an outstanding contribution to our understanding of the fundamental particles and their interactions, and also to the technologies needed to analyse their properties and behaviour. The experimental challenges have pushed the performance of particle accelerators and detectors to the limits of our technical capabilities, and these groundbreaking technologies can also have a significant impact in applications beyond particle physics. In particular, the detectors developed for particle physics have led to improved techniques for medical imaging, while accelerator technologies lie at the heart of the irradiation methods that are widely used for treating cancer. Indeed, many important diagnostic and therapeutic techniques used by healthcare professionals are based either on basic physics principles or the technologies developed to carry out physics research. Ever since the discovery of x-rays by Roentgen in 1895, physics has been instrumental in the development of technologies in the biomedical domain, including the use of ionizing radiation for medical imaging and therapy. Some key examples that are explored in detail in this book include scanners based on positron emission tomography, as well as radiation therapy for cancer treatment. Even the collaborative model of particle physics is proving to be effective in catalysing multidisciplinary research for medical applications, ensuring that pioneering physics research is exploited for the benefit of all.

It recorded the first physics data with hadron beams in 2009 and with ion beams (secondary 7Be beams) in 2011. NA61/SHINE has greatly profited from the long development of the CERN proton and ion sources and the accelerator chain as well as the H2 beamline of the CERN North Area. The latter has recently been modified to also serve as a fragment separator as needed to produce the Be beams for NA61/SHINE. Numerous components of the NA61/SHINE set-up were inherited from its predecessors, in particular, the last one, the NA49 experiment. Important new detectors and upgrades of the legacy equipment were introduced by the NA61/SHINE Collaboration. This paper describes the state of the NA61/SHINE facility â the beams and the detector system â before the CERN Long Shutdown I, which started in March 2013.

These resources are shared between the four LHC VOs and a number of national and international VOs from high energy physics and other sciences. CernVM-FS has been deployed at GridKa to supplement the existing NFS-based system to access VO software on the worker nodes. It provides a solution tailored to the requirement of the LHC VOs. We will focus on the first operational experiences and the monitoring of CernVM-FS on the worker nodes and the squid caches. Pixel detectors for use in retina neurophysiology studies NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cunningham, W.; Mathieson, K.; Horn, M.; Melone, J.; McEwan, F. A.; Blue, A.; O'Shea, V.; Smith, K. M.; Litke, A.; Chichilnisky, E. J.; Rahman, M. 2003-08-01 One area of major inter-disciplinary co-operation is between the particle physics and bio-medical communities. The type of large detector arrays and fast electronics developed in laboratories like CERN are becoming used for a wide range of medical and biological experiments. In the present work fabrication technology developed for producing semiconductor radiation detectors has been applied to produce arrays which have been used in neuro-physiological experiments on retinal tissue. We have exploited UVIII, a low molecular weight resist, that has permitted large area electron beam lithography. This allows the resolution to go below that of conventional photolithography and hence the production of densely packed Ë500 electrode arrays with feature sizes down to below 2 Î¼m. The neural signals from significant areas of the retina may thus be captured. Lattice QCD at finite temperature and density from Taylor expansion NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Steinbrecher, Patrick 2017-01-01 In the first part, I present an overview of recent Lattice QCD simulations at finite temperature and density. In particular, we discuss fluctuations of conserved charges: baryon number, electric charge and strangeness. These can be obtained from Taylor expanding the QCD pressure as a function of corresponding chemical potentials. Our simulations were performed using quark masses corresponding to physical pion mass of about 140 MeV and allow a direct comparison to experimental data from ultra-relativistic heavy ion beams at hadron colliders such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In the second part, we discuss computational challenges for current and future exascale Lattice simulations with a focus on new silicon developments from Intel and NVIDIA.

UK Curriculum: Assessment of Science Learning 14-19 Forthcoming Events Recent results in relativistic heavy ion collisions: from 'a new state of matter' to 'the perfect fluid' NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Tannenbaum, M. J. 2006-07-01 Experimental physics with relativistic heavy ions dates from 1992 when a beam of 197Au of energy greater than 10 A GeV/c first became available at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) soon followed in 1994 by a 208Pb beam of 158A GeV/c at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research). Previous pioneering measurements at the Berkeley Bevalac (Gutbrod et al 1989 Rep. Prog. Phys. 52 1267-132) in the late 1970s and early 1980s were at much lower bombarding energies (<~1A GeV/c) where nuclear breakup rather than particle production is the dominant inelastic process in A+A collisions. More recently, starting in 2000, the relativistic heavy ion collider at BNL has produced head-on collisions of two 100 A GeV beams of fully stripped Au ions, corresponding to nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass (cm) energy, \\\\sqrt{s_NN}=200\\\\,GeV , total cm energy 200 A GeV. The objective of this research program is to produce nuclear matter with extreme density and temperature, possibly resulting in a state of matter where the quarks and gluons normally confined inside individual nucleons (r < 1 fm) are free to act over distances an order of magnitude larger. Progress from the period 1992 to the present will be reviewed, with reference to previous results from light ion and proton-proton collisions where appropriate. Emphasis will be placed on the measurements which formed the basis for the announcements by the two major laboratories: 'A new state of matter', by CERN on Febraury 10 2000 and 'The perfect fluid' by BNL on April 19 2005. Common HEP UNIX Environment NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Taddei, Arnaud After it had been decided to design a common user environment for UNIX platforms among HEP laboratories, a joint project between DESY and CERN had been started. The project consists in 2 phases: 1. Provide a common user environment at shell level, 2. Provide a common user environment at graphical level (X11). Phase 1 is in production at DESY and at CERN as well as at PISA and RAL. It has been developed around the scripts originally designed at DESY Zeuthen improved and extended with a 2 months project at CERN with a contribution from DESY Hamburg. It consists of a set of files which are customizing the environment for the 6 main shells (sh, csh, ksh, bash, tcsh, zsh) on the main platforms (AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, SunOS, Solaris 2, OSF/1, ULTRIX, etc.) and it is divided at several \"sociological\" levels: HEP, site, machine, cluster, group of users and user with some levels which are optional. The second phase is under design and a first proposal has been published. A first version of the phase 2 exists already for AIX and Solaris, and it should be available for all other platforms, by the time of the conference. This is a major collective work between several HEP laboratories involved in the HEPiX-scripts and HEPiX-X11 working-groups.

Lead ions and Coulombâs Law at the LHC (CERN) NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cid-Vidal, Xabier; Cid, Ramon 2018-03-01 Although for most of the time the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN collides protons, for around one month every year lead ions are collided, to expand the diversity of the LHC research programme. Furthermore, in an effort not originally foreseen, proton-lead collisions are also taking place, with results of high interest to the physics community. All the large experiments of the LHC have now joined the heavy-ion programme, including the LHCb experiment, which was not at first expected to be part of it. The aim of this article is to introduce a few simple physical calculations relating to some electrical phenomena that occur when lead-ion bunches are running in the LHC, using Coulombâs Law, to be taken to the secondary school classroom to help students understand some important physical concepts.

That meeting turned out to be a wonderful opportunity I would never have otherwise had. During the meeting I met Michael Tuts, a physicist who was working on project ATLAS at CERN. Afterwards, I walked with him out of the Senate office building to Union Station and, in parting, he gave me his card and told me that if I were in Geneva that he could help me get a tour of CERN and the LHC. Underground neutrino detectors for particle and astroparticle Science: The Giant Liquid Argon Charge Imaging ExpeRiment (GLACIER) NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Rubbia, AndrÃ© 2009-06-01 The current focus of the CERN program is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), however, CERN is engaged in long baseline neutrino physics with the CNGS project and supports T2K as recognized CERN RE13, and for good reasons: a number of observed phenomena in high-energy physics and cosmology lack their resolution within the Standard Model of particle physics; these puzzles include the origin of neutrino masses, CP-violation in the leptonic sector, and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. They will only partially be addressed at LHC. A positive measurement of sin2 2Î¸13 > 0.01 would certainly give a tremendous boost to neutrino physics by opening the possibility to study CP violation in the lepton sector and the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy with upgraded conventional super-beams. These experiments (so called 'Phase II') require, in addition to an upgraded beam power, next generation very massive neutrino detectors with excellent energy resolution and high detection efficiency in a wide neutrino energy range, to cover 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima, and excellent particle identification and p0 background suppression. Two generations of large water Cherenkov detectors at Kamioka (Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande) have been extremely successful. And there are good reasons to consider a third generation water Cherenkov detector with an order of magnitude larger mass than Super-Kamiokande for both non-accelerator (proton decay, supernovae,...) and accelerator-based physics. On the other hand, a very massive underground liquid Argon detector of about 100 kton could represent a credible alternative for the precision measurements of 'Phase II' and aim at significantly new results in neutrino astroparticle and non-accelerator-based particle physics (e.g. proton decay).

WalcherÂ«Â less CERN@school: bringing CERN into the classroom NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Whyntie, T.; Cook, J.; Coupe, A.; Fickling, R. L.; Parker, B.; Shearer, N. 2016-04-01 CERN@school brings technology from CERN into the classroom to aid with the teaching of particle physics. It also aims to inspire the next generation of physicists and engineers by giving participants the opportunity to be part of a national collaboration of students, teachers and academics, analysing data obtained from detectors based on the ground and in space to make new, curiosity-driven discoveries at school. CERN@school is based around the Timepix hybrid silicon pixel detector developed by the Medipix 2 Collaboration, which features a 300 Î¼m thick silicon sensor bump-bonded to a Timepix readout ASIC. This defines a 256-by-256 grid of pixels with a pitch of 55 Î¼m, the data from which can be used to visualise ionising radiation in a very accessible way. Broadly speaking, CERN@school consists of a web portal that allows access to data collected by the Langton Ultimate Cosmic ray Intensity Detector (LUCID) experiment in space and the student-operated Timepix detectors on the ground; a number of Timepix detector kits for ground-based experiments, to be made available to schools for both teaching and research purposes; and educational resources for teachers to use with LUCID data and detector kits in the classroom. By providing access to cutting-edge research equipment, raw data from ground and space-based experiments, CERN@school hopes to provide the foundation for a programme that meets the many of the aims and objectives of CERN and the project's supporting academic and industrial partners. The work presented here provides an update on the status of the programme as supported by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851.

Joining the 1200 participants at the GenÃ¨ve200 celebrations were staff from the CERN particle-physics lab, which is located on the outskirts of Geneva, who paraded a superconducting dipole magnet - similar to the thousands used in the Large Hadron Collider - through the city's narrow streets on a 20 m lorry. « 5 6 7 8 9 » « 6 7 8 9 10 » O8.10A MODEL FOR RESEARCH INITIATIVES FOR RARE CANCERS: THE COLLABORATIVE EPENDYMOMA RESEARCH NETWORK (CERN) PubMed Central Armstrong, T.S.; Aldape, K.; Gajjar, A.; Haynes, C.; Hirakawa, D.; Gilbertson, R.; Gilbert, M.R. 2014-01-01 Ependymoma represents less than 5% of adult central nervous system (CNS) tumors and a higher percentage of pediatric CNS tumors, but it remains an orphan disease. The majority of the laboratory-based research and clinical trials have been conducted in the pediatric setting, a reflection of the relative incidence and funding opportunities. CERN, created in 2006, was designed to establish a collaborative effort between laboratory and clinical research and pediatric and adult investigators. The organization of CERN is based on integration and collaboration among five projects. Project 1 contains the clinical trials network encompassing both adult and pediatric centers. This group has completed 2 clinical trials with more underway. Project 2 is focused on molecular classification of human ependymoma tumor tissues and also contains the tumor repository which has now collected over 600 fully clinically annotated CNS ependymomas from adults and children. Project 3 is focused on drug discovery utilizing robust laboratory models of ependymoma to perform high throughput screening of drug libraries, then taking promising agents through extensive preclinical testing including monitoring of drug delivery to tumor using state of the art microdialysis. Project 4 contains the basic research efforts evaluating the molecular pathogenesis of ependymoma and has successfully translated these findings by generating the first mouse models of ependymoma that are employed in preclinical drug development in Project 3. Project 5 studies patient outcomes, including the incorporation of these measures in the clinical trials. This project also contains an online Ependymoma Outcomes survey, collecting data on the consequences of the disease and its treatment. These projects have been highly successful and collaborative. For example, the serial measurement of symptom burden (Project 5) has greatly contributed to the evaluation of treatment efficacy of a clinical trial (Project 1) and investigators from Project 2 are evaluating potential predictive markers from tumor tissue from the same clinical trial. Results from genomic and molecular discoveries generated by Project 4 were evaluated using the clinical material from the Tumor Registry (Project 2). Agents identified from the high throughput screening in Project 3 are being used to create novel clinical trials (Project 1). As a complimentary effort, CERN's community outreach efforts provide a major gateway to patients, families, caregivers and healthcare providers, contributing to greater awareness of ependymoma, and supporting clinical trial accrual in Project 1. In summary, CERN has successfully created a collaborative, multi-national integrated effort combining pediatric- and adult-focused investigators spanning from basic science to patient outcomes measures. This research paradigm may be an effective approach for other rare cancers.

This decay is strongly suppressed in the Standard Model. On the other hand its branching ratio is calculated with high accuracy. NA62 is designed to measure the K+ âÏ+ Î½ Î½ â¾ decay rate with an uncertainty better than 10%. The measurement can serve as a probe to some new physics phenomena, which can alter the decay rate. The NA62 experiment has been successfully launched in October 2014. The theory framework as well as the NA62 detector and the preliminary results are reviewed in this article. Federated data storage and management infrastructure NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zarochentsev, A.; Kiryanov, A.; Klimentov, A.; Krasnopevtsev, D.; Hristov, P. 2016-10-01 The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)â operating at the international CERN Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, is leading Big Data driven scientific explorations. Experiments at the LHC explore the fundamental nature of matter and the basic forces that shape our universe. Computing models for the High Luminosity LHC era anticipate a growth of storage needs of at least orders of magnitude; it will require new approaches in data storage organization and data handling. In our project we address the fundamental problem of designing of architecture to integrate a distributed heterogeneous disk resources for LHC experiments and other data- intensive science applications and to provide access to data from heterogeneous computing facilities. We have prototyped a federated storage for Russian T1 and T2 centers located in Moscow, St.-Petersburg and Gatchina, as well as Russian / CERN federation. We have conducted extensive tests of underlying network infrastructure and storage endpoints with synthetic performance measurement tools as well as with HENP-specific workloads, including the ones running on supercomputing platform, cloud computing and Grid for ALICE and ATLAS experiments. We will present our current accomplishments with running LHC data analysis remotely and locally to demonstrate our ability to efficiently use federated data storage experiment wide within National Academic facilities for High Energy and Nuclear Physics as well as for other data-intensive science applications, such as bio-informatics. 40th Anniversary of the First Proton-Proton Collisions in the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) ScienceCinema None 2018-06-20 Welcome, Luigi di Lella and Rolf Heuer-Design and Construction of the ISR, Kurt Hubner-Physics at small angles, Ugo Amaldi (TERA Foundation)-The Impact of the ISR on Accelerator Physics and Technology, Philip J.

S. Antihydrogenâthe antimatter equivalent of the hydrogen atomâis of fundamental interest as a test bed for universal symmetriesâsuch as CPT and the Weak Equivalence Principle for gravitation. Invariance under CPT requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Antimatter is of course intriguing because of the observed baryon asymmetry in the universeâcurrently unexplained by the Standard Model. At the CERN Antiproton Decelerator (AD) [ 1], several groups have been working diligently since 1999 to produce, trap, and study the structure and behaviour of the antihydrogen atom. One of the main thrusts of the AD experimental program is to apply precision techniques from atomic physics to the study of antimatter. Such experiments complement the high-energy searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. Antihydrogen is the only atom of antimatter to be produced in the laboratory. This is not so unfortunate, as its matter equivalent, hydrogen, is one of the most well-understood and accurately measured systems in all of physics. It is thus very compelling to undertake experimental examinations of the structure of antihydrogen. As experimental spectroscopy of antihydrogen has yet to begin in earnest, I will give here a brief introduction to some of the ion and atom trap developments necessary for synthesizing and trapping antihydrogen, so that it can be studied.

This is a collaborative effort by BNL and CERN teams with a common goal to study an EBIS with electron beam current up to 10 A, current density up to 10,000 A/cm{sup 2} and energy more than 50 keV. Intensive and pure beams of heavy highly charged ions with mass-to-charge ratio < 4.5 are requested by many heavy ion research facilities including NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL and HIE-ISOLDE at CERN. With a multiampere electron gun, themoreÂ Â» EBIS should be capable of delivering highly charged ions for both RHIC facility applications at BNL and for ISOLDE experiments at CERN. Details of the electron gun simulations and design, and the Test EBIS electrostatic and magnetostatic structures with the new electron gun are presented. The experimental results of the electron beam transmission are given.Â«Â less PREFACE: SPIN2010 - Preface for Conference Proceedings NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) StrÃ¶her, Hans; Rathmann, Frank 2011-03-01 SPIN2010, the 19th International Spin Physics Symposium, took place between 27 September and 2 October, 2010 on the campus of Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich GmbH (FZJ) in JÃ¼lich, Germany. The scientific program of this Symposium included many topics related to spin phenomena in particle and nuclear physics as well as those in related fields. The International Spin Physics Symposium series has combined the High Energy Spin Symposia and the Nuclear Polarization Conferences since 2000. The most recent two Symposia were held in Virginia, USA (October 2008) and in Kyoto, Japan (October 2006). The meeting was opened by the chairman of the Board of Management of JÃ¼lich Forschungszentrum, Professor Achim Bachem, who cordially welcomed the participants from all over the world and gave a brief introduction to the Center and the research conducted there. The scientific program consisted of plenary sessions and parallel sessions and included the following topics: Fundamental symmetries and spin Spin structure of hadrons Spin physics beyond the Standard Model Spin in hadronic reactions Spin physics with photons and leptons Spin physics in nuclear reactions and nuclei Acceleration, storage, and polarimetry of polarized beams Polarized ion and lepton sources and targets Future facilities and experiments Medical and technological applications of spin physics The 6-day symposium had about 300 participants. In total 35 plenary talks (including 3 summaries of other spin physics meetings) and 163 contributed talks were given. The contents of many of these can be found in the present contributions, arranged according to the above topics and the time sequence. In addition, a public lecture on \"Drall in der Quantenwelt\", presented by H O Meyer (Bloomington) was received very well. Participants had the option to visit the Cooler synchrotron COSY at the Nuclear Physics Institute (IKP) and the 9.4 T MRT-PET hybrid scanner at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM), two unique facilities at FZJ, and many made the most of the opportunity. We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, USA), Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich (FZJ), the International Union of Pure And Applied Physics (IUPAP), Thomas Jefferson Laboratory (JLab, USA), Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM, Germany) and the Virtual Institute on Spin and Strong QCD (VI-QCD) of the Helmholtz Association (HGF). We would also like to thank the local people from IKP and other institutions of FZJ for their contributions and help - without them we would not have been able to organize this great meeting. The current proceedings comprise written contributions of many of the presentations during SPIN2010; however, due to the recent incident in Japan, a number of our colleagues from there were unfortunately not able to deliver their write-ups in due time. This volume was edited by Ralf Gebel, Christoph Hanhart, Andro Kacharava, Andreas Lehrach, Bernd Lorentz, Nikolai N Nikolaev, Andreas Nogga, Frank Rathmann, and Hans StrÃ¶her. The next symposium - SPIN2012 - will be held at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna (Russia) in 2012. We are looking forward to meeting you there.

This paper presents the hardware and software facilities of Science Operation Center (SOC) at CERN. Data Production is built around production server - a scalable distributed service which links together a set of different programming modules for science data transformation and reconstruction. The server has the capacity to manage 1000 paralleled job producers, i.e. up to 32K logical processors. Monitoring and management tool with Production GUI is also described. The ISOLDE LEGOÂ® robot: building interest in frontier research NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Elias Cocolios, Thomas; Lynch, Kara M.; Nichols, Emma 2017-07-01 An outreach programme centred around nuclear physics making use of a LEGOÂ® MindstormÂ® kit is presented. It consists of a presentation given by trained undergraduate students as science ambassadors followed by a workshop where the target audience programs the LEGOÂ® MindstormÂ® robots to familiarise themselves with the concepts in an interactive and exciting way. This programme has been coupled with the CERN-ISOLDE 50th anniversary and the launch of the CERN-MEDICIS facility in Geneva, Switzerland. The modular aspect of the programme readily allows its application to other topics. Commissioning results of CERN HIE-ISOLDE and INFN ALPI cryogenic control systems NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Inglese, V.; Pezzetti, M.; Calore, A.; Modanese, P.; Pengo, R. 2017-02-01 The cryogenic systems of both accelerators, namely HIE ISOLDE (High Intensity and Energy Isotope Separator On Line DEvice) at CERN and ALPI (Acceleratore Lineare Per Ioni) at LNL, have been refurbished. HIE ISOLDE is a major upgrade of the existing ISOLDE facilities, which required the construction of a superconducting linear accelerator consisting of six cryomodules, each containing five superconductive RF cavities and superconducting solenoids. The ALPI linear accelerator, similar to HIE ISOLDE, is located at Legnaro National Laboratories (LNL) and became operational in the early 90âs. It is composed of 74 superconducting RF cavities, assembled inside 22 cryostats. The new control systems are equipped with PLC, developed on the CERN UNICOS framework, which include Schneider and Siemens PLCs and various fieldbuses (Profibus DP and PA, WorldFIP). The control systems were developed in synergy between CERN and LNL in order to build, effectively and with an optimized use of resources, control systems allowing to enhance ease of operation, maintainability, and long-term availability. This paper describes (i) the cryogenic systems, with special focus on the design of the control systems hardware and software, (ii) the strategy adopted in order to achieve a synergic approach, and (iii) the commissioning results after the cool-down to 4.5 K of the cryomodules. Air liquide 1.8 K refrigeration units for CERN LHC project NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Hilbert, BenoÃ®t; Gistau-Baguer, Guy M.; Caillaud, AurÃ©lie 2002-05-01 The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be CERN's next research instrument for high energy physics. This 27 km long circular accelerator will make intensive use of superconducting magnets, operated below 2.0 K. It will thus require high capacity refrigeration below 2.0 K [1, 2]. Coupled to a refrigerator providing 18 kW equivalent at 4.5 K [3], these systems will be able to absorb a cryogenic power of 2.4 kW at 1.8 K in nominal conditions. Air Liquide has designed one Cold Compressor System (CCS) pre-series for CERN-preceding 3 more of them (among 8 in total located around the machine). These systems, making use of cryogenic centrifugal compressors in a series arrangement coupled to room temperature screw compressors, are presented. Key components characteristics will be given. Wolfgang Kummer at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Schopper, Herwig Wolfgang Kummer was not only a great theorist but also a man with a noble spirit and extensive education, based on a fascinating long-term Austrian cultural tradition. As an experimentalist I am not sufficiently knowledgeable to evaluate his contributions to theoretical physics - this will certainly be done by more competent scientists. Nevertheless I admired him for not only being attached to fundamental and abstract problems like quantum field theory, quantum gravity or black holes, but for his interest in down to earth questions like electron-proton scattering or the toponium mass. I got to know Wolfgang Kummer very well and appreciate his human qualities during his long attachment to CERN, in particular when he served as president of the CERN Council, the highest decision taking authority of this international research centre, from 1985 to 1987 falling into my term as Director-Generalâ¦ \"Physics on Stage\" Festival Video Now Available NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 2001-01-01 ESO Video Clip 01/01 is issued on the web in conjunction with the release of an 18-min documentary video from the Science Festival of the \"Physics On Stage\" programme. This unique event took place during November 6-11, 2000, on the CERN premises at the French-Swiss border near Geneva, and formed part of the European Science and Technology Week 2000, an initiative by the European Commission to raise the public awareness of science in Europe. Physics On Stage and the Science Festival were jointly organised by CERN, ESA and ESO, in collaboration with the European Physical Society (EPS) and the European Association for Astronomy Education (EAAE) and national organisations in about 25 European countries. During this final phase of the yearlong Physics On Stage programme, more than 500 physics teachers, government officials and media representatives gathered at CERN to discuss different aspects of physics education. The meeting was particular timely in view of the current decline of interest in physics and technology by Europe's citizens, especially schoolchildren. It included spectacular demonstrations of new educational materials and methods. An 18-min video is now available that documents this event. It conveys the great enthusiasm of the many participants who spent an extremely fruitful week, meeting and exchanging information with colleagues from all over the continent. It shows the various types of activities that took place, from the central \"fair\" with national and organisational booths to the exciting performances and other dramatic presentations. Based of the outcome of 13 workshops that focussed on different subject matters, a series of very useful recommendations was passed at the final session. The Science Festival was also visited by several high-ranking officials, including the European Commissioner for Research, Phillipe Busquin. Full reports from the Festival will soon become available from the International Steering Committee..More information is available on the \"Physics on Stage\" webpages at CERN , ESA and ESO ). Note also the brief account published in the December 2000 issue of the ESO Messenger. The present video clip is available in four versions: two MPEG files and two streamer-versions of different sizes; the latter require RealPlayer software. Video Clip 01/01 may be freely reproduced.

C.; Vamosi, S.; Vladymyrov, M.; Widmann, E.; Yzombard, P.; Zimmer, C.; Zmeskal, J.; Zurlo, N. 2017-04-01 The characteristics of low energy antiproton annihilations on nuclei (e.g. hadronization and product multiplicities) are not well known, and Monte Carlo simulation packages that use different models provide different descriptions of the annihilation events. In this study, we measured the particle multiplicities resulting from antiproton annihilations on nuclei. The results were compared with predictions obtained using different models in the simulation tools GEANT4 and FLUKA. For this study, we exposed thin targets (Cu, Ag and Au) to a very low energy antiproton beam from CERN's Antiproton Decelerator, exploiting the secondary beamline available in the AEgIS experimental zone. The antiproton annihilation products were detected using emulsion films developed at the Laboratory of High Energy Physics in Bern, where they were analysed at the automatic microscope facility. The fragment multiplicity measured in this study is in good agreement with results obtained with FLUKA simulations for both minimally and heavily ionizing particles. Cryogenic mount for mirror and piezoelectric actuator for an optical cavity. PubMed Oliveira, A N; Moreira, L S; Sacramento, R L; Kosulic, L; Brasil, V B; Wolff, W; Cesar, C L 2017-06-01 We present the development of a mount that accommodates a mirror and a piezoelectric actuator with emphasis on physical needs for low temperature operation. The design uses a monolithic construction with flexure features that allow it to steadily hold the mirror and the piezoelectric actuator without glue and accommodate differential thermal contraction. The mount is small and lightweight, adding little heat capacity and inertia. It provides a pre-loading of the piezoelectric actuator as well as a good thermal connection to the mirror and a thermal short across the piezoelectric actuator. The performance of the assemblies has been tested by thermally cycling from room temperature down to 3 K more than a dozen times and over one hundred times to 77 K, without showing any derating. Such mounts are proposed for the cryogenic optical enhancement cavities of the ALPHA experiment at CERN for laser spectroscopy of antihydrogen and for hydrogen spectroscopy in our laboratory at UFRJ. Latest results of OPERA NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Meregaglia, A.; Opera Collaboration 2017-04-01 OPERA is a long baseline neutrino experiment which took data between 2008 and 2012 having for goal the observation of the Î½Î¼ âÎ½Ï transition in appearance mode i.e. detecting the Ï lepton. The detector was located in the underground Gran Sasso laboratory, 730 km away from the CNGS neutrino beam production at CERN. The collaboration observed 5 Î½Ï candidates which, considering the very low expected background of 0.25 events, allowed for a discovery claim of neutrino oscillation in appearance mode at the level of 5.1 Ï. Additional analyses were performed aiming at the possible observation of the Î½Î¼ âÎ½e transition, and at the search for anomalies related to the possible existence of a sterile neutrino. In this paper, after a short introduction describing the detector, the different results are presented on both oscillation channels including standard 3 flavour scenario and possible new physics. An efficient, modular and simple tape archiving solution for LHC Run-3 NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Murray, S.; Bahyl, V.; Cancio, G.; Cano, E.; Kotlyar, V.; Kruse, D. F.; Leduc, J. 2017-10-01 The IT Storage group at CERN develops the software responsible for archiving to tape the custodial copy of the physics data generated by the LHC experiments. Physics run 3 will start in 2021 and will introduce two major challenges for which the tape archive software must be evolved. Firstly the software will need to make more efficient use of tape drives in order to sustain the predicted data rate of 150 petabytes per year as opposed to the current 50 petabytes per year. Secondly the software will need to be seamlessly integrated with EOS, which has become the de facto disk storage system provided by the IT Storage group for physics data. The tape storage software for LHC physics run 3 is code named CTA (the CERN Tape Archive). This paper describes how CTA will introduce a pre-emptive drive scheduler to use tape drives more efficiently, will encapsulate all tape software into a single module that will sit behind one or more EOS systems, and will be simpler by dropping support for obsolete backwards compatibility. PREFACE: XVth International Conference on Calorimetry in High Energy Physics (CALOR2012) NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Akchurin, Nural 2012-12-01 The XVth International Conference on Calorimetry in High Energy Physics, CALOR2012, was held in Santa Fe, New Mexico from 4-8 June 2012. The series of conferences on calorimetry started in 1990 at Fermilab, and they have been the premier event for calorimeter aficionados, a trend that CALOR2012 upheld. This year, several presentations focused on the status of the major calorimeter systems, especially at the LHC. Discussions on new and developing techniques in calorimetry took a full day. Excellent updates on uses of calorimeters or about ideas that are deeply rooted in particle physics calorimetry in astrophysics and neutrino physics were followed by talks on algorithms and special triggers that rely on calorimeters. Finally, discussions of promising current developments and ongoing R&D work for future calorimeters capped the conference. The field of calorimetry is alive and well, as evidenced by the more than 100 attendees and the excellent quality of over 80 presentations. You will find the written contributions in this volume. The presentations can be found at calor2012.ttu.edu. The first day of the conference was dedicated to the LHC. In two invited talks, Guillaume Unal (CERN) and Tommaso Tabarelli de Fatis (Universita' & INFN Milano Bicocca) discussed the critical role electromagnetic calorimeters play in the hunt for the Standard Model Higgs boson in ATLAS and CMS, respectively. The enhanced sensitivity for light Higgs in the two-gamma decay channel renders electromagnetic calorimeters indispensible. Much of the higher mass region was already excluded for the SM Higgs by the time of this conference, and after less than a month, on 4 July, CERN announced the discovery of a new boson at 125 GeV, a particle that seems consistent with the Higgs particle so far. Once again, without the electromagnetic calorimeters, this would not have been possible. Professor Geoffrey West from the Santa Fe Institute gave the keynote address. His talk, 'Universal Scaling Laws from Cells to Cities - a Physicist's Search for Quantitative, Unified Theories of Biological and Social Structure and Dynamics,' inspired many interesting questions from the audience both after the talk and throughout the week during informal conversations. Calorimetry is extremely diverse: many different techniques may be employed in building the detector and also in extracting information from it. The topics of the Calorimeter Techniques sessions included high-rate liquid argon calorimeters, SiPM sensors, highly granular digital calorimeters, new crystals, and beam test and simulation results. In these pages, you will find exciting and sometimes contradicting points of view expressed, for example about fully sampling hadronic calorimeters. A rare astronomical event, the Venus transit, coincided with the second day of the conference. The participants enjoyed viewing Venus' trail across the sun with a solar telescope (H-alpha line at 656 nm). In Santa Fe, the interior ingress was at 16:23:04 and reached center at 19:27:04. The last transit occurred in 2004, and the next one will happen in 2117. In 1627, Johannes Kepler published data about the planetary orbits that predicted that Venus would pass directly between earth and the sun in 1631. Unfortunately Kepler died in 1630 and apparently nobody recorded the 1631 transit. The first recorded observation of a transit was in 1638, which Kepler had not predicted. Later, Jeremiah Horracks, an English astronomer, realized Kepler had made an error in his calculations. It was not until the Venus transit observations of 1769 that scientists measured the distance from the earth to the sun to be 95 million miles (actually 93 million miles or 149.7 million kilometers) based on the 1716 triangulation suggestion from Edmund Halley (of comet fame). It's interesting to remember that before the 18th century, one of the most vexing scientific puzzles, not unlike today's Higgs boson quest, was 'How far away is the Sun?' Although natural media such as Mediterranean water (ANTARES), Arctic ice (ARA, ARIANNA, ANITA, and others) or Utah air (TA) would hardly be choice absorbers in accelerator-based experiments, they are nevertheless successfully exploited in searches for new phenomena, as discussed by the members of these collaborations in several talks. Philippe Bruel (LLR, Ecole Polytechnique) gave an overview of the gamma-ray sky above 20 MeV using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the role of the hodoscopic array of CsI(Tl) calorimeter in an invited talk. In a second invited presentation, Sylvie Rosier-Lees (LAPP-Annecy) described the ECAL design (Pb/scintillating fiber sandwich) of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) that has been operating in the International Space Station since May 2011 and has collected over 15 billion events. The environs of Santa Fe have long been considered sacred by the first nation Americans and have been a source of inspiration for generations of artists, writers, and scientists. Robert Oppenheimer's love of this area played no small role in establishing what is now the nearby Los Alamos National Laboratory during the Second World War. On the third conference day, some participants visited the lab after an awe-inspiring trip to the Bandelier National Monument, where beautiful canyons and mesas show evidence of a human presence for over 11,000 years. Petroglyphs, dwellings carved into the soft rock cliffs, and standing masonry walls in the park mark the early days of a culture that still persists in surrounding communities. We are grateful to the International Advisory Committee for allowing us the opportunity to hold this Conference in these enchanted lands. In addition to making advances in calorimeter design, hardware, and front-end electronics, we in particle physics increasingly find ourselves inventing new algorithms to reconstruct physics objects that use the detector information to its maximum capacity. Several presentations provided details of the reconstruction and trigger of jets, missing transverse energy, electrons, photons, and taus. Pile-up, anomalous signals, and noise mitigation techniques were also discussed in the conference. On the last day, several future R&D initiatives were presented: highly granular CALICE with different technology options and plans for the dual-readout DREAM projects were the main topics. Although these approaches are quite different conceptually, future experiments will certainly benefit from their innovations. Concluding remarks by the chair of the organizing committee, Nural Akchurin (TTU), summarized the highlights of the conference and invited proposals to host the CALOR2014 conference in Europe, as the conference venue rotates between the Americas, Europe, and Asia every two years. We strived hard to keep the cost of this conference as low as possible without sacrificing the scientific mission. I am delighted to report that we were able to provide support for six junior colleagues to participate in this conference. I am also grateful to the institutions, industrial partners, and agencies that provided the support that made a lot possible: Texas Tech University, the University of New Mexico, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the US Department of Energy, CAEN, and the Wiener Plein & Baus, Corp. I also would like to thank the session conveners who organized sessions and reviewed the papers. The members of the local organizing committee were instrumental to the success of this conference: their experience and attention to detail were invaluable. Most of all, I extend my appreciation to the conference participants and to all my other colleagues who continue to enrich the field of calorimetry through their hard work and creativity. The future is bright.

PubMed Dippel, Anne 2017-12-01 This article looks at how games and play contribute to the big data-driven production of knowledge in High-Energy Physics, with aÂ particular focus on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), where the author has been conducting anthropological fieldwork since 2014. The ludic (playful) aspect of knowledge production is analyzed here in three different dimensions: the Symbolic, the Ontological, and the Epistemic. The first one points towards CERN as place where aÂ cosmological game of probability is played with the help of Monte-Carlo simulations. The second one can be seen in the agonistic infrastructures of competing experimental collaborations. The third dimension unfolds in ludic platforms, such as online Challenges and citizen science games, which contribute to the development of machine learning algorithms, whose function is necessary in order to process the huge amount of data gathered from experimental events. Following Clifford Geertz, CERN itself is characterized as aÂ site of deep play, aÂ concept that contributes to understanding wider social and cultural orders through the analysis of ludic collective phenomena. The article also engages with Peter Galison's idea of the trading zone, proposing to comprehend it in the age of big data as aÂ Playground. Thus the author hopes to contribute to aÂ wider discussion in the historiographical and social study of science and technology, as well as in cultural anthropology, by recognizing the ludic in science as aÂ central element of understanding collaborative knowledge production. Helix Nebula and CERN: A Symbiotic approach to exploiting commercial clouds NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Barreiro Megino, Fernando H.; Jones, Robert; Kucharczyk, Katarzyna; Medrano Llamas, RamÃ³n; van der Ster, Daniel 2014-06-01 The recent paradigm shift toward cloud computing in IT, and general interest in \"Big Data\" in particular, have demonstrated that the computing requirements of HEP are no longer globally unique. Indeed, the CERN IT department and LHC experiments have already made significant R&D investments in delivering and exploiting cloud computing resources. While a number of technical evaluations of interesting commercial offerings from global IT enterprises have been performed by various physics labs, further technical, security, sociological, and legal issues need to be address before their large-scale adoption by the research community can be envisaged. Helix Nebula - the Science Cloud is an initiative that explores these questions by joining the forces of three European research institutes (CERN, ESA and EMBL) with leading European commercial IT enterprises. The goals of Helix Nebula are to establish a cloud platform federating multiple commercial cloud providers, along with new business models, which can sustain the cloud marketplace for years to come. This contribution will summarize the participation of CERN in Helix Nebula. We will explain CERN's flagship use-case and the model used to integrate several cloud providers with an LHC experiment's workload management system. During the first proof of concept, this project contributed over 40.000 CPU-days of Monte Carlo production throughput to the ATLAS experiment with marginal manpower required. CERN's experience, together with that of ESA and EMBL, is providing a great insight into the cloud computing industry and highlighted several challenges that are being tackled in order to ease the export of the scientific workloads to the cloud environments.

Optical fibres are widely used at CERN, both in surface areas (e.g. for inter-building IT networks) and in the accelerator complex underground (e.g. for cryogenics, vacuum, safety systems). Optical fibres in the accelerator are exposed to mixed radiation fields (mainly composed of protons, pions, neutrons and other hadrons, gamma rays and electrons), with dose rates depending on the particular installation zone, and with radiation levels often significantly higher than those encountered in space. In the LHC and its injector chain radiation levels range from relatively low annual doses of a few Gy up to hundreds of kGy. Optical fibres suffer from Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA, expressed in dB per unit length) that affect light transmission and which depends on the irradiation conditions (e.g. dose rate, total dose, temperature). In the CERN accelerator complex, the failure of an optical link can affect the proper functionality of control or monitoring systems and induce the interruption of the accelerator operation. The qualification of optical fibres for installation in critical radiation areas is therefore crucial. Thus, all optical fibre types installed in radiation areas at CERN are subject to laboratory irradiation tests, in order to evaluate their RIA at different total dose and dose rates. This allows the selection of the appropriate optical fibre type (conventional or radiation resistant) compliant with the requirements of each installation. Irradiation tests are performed in collaboration with Fraunhofer INT (irradiation facilities and expert team in Euskirchen, Germany). Conventional off-the-shelf optical fibres can be installed for optical links exposed to low radiation levels (i.e. annual dose typically below few kGy). Nevertheless, the conventional optical fibres must be carefully qualified as a spread in RIA of factor 10 is observed among optical fibres of different types and dopants. In higher radiation areas, special radiation resistant optical fibres are installed. For total dose above 1 kGy, the RIA of these special optical fibres is at least 10 times lower than the conventional optical fibres RIA at same irradiation conditions. 2400 km of these special radiation resistant optical fibres were recently procured at CERN. As part of this procurement process, a quality assurance plan including the irradiation testing of all 65 produced batches was set up. This presentation will review the selection process of the appropriate optical fibre types to be installed in the radiation environment of CERN. The methodology for choosing the irradiation parameters for the laboratory tests will be discussed together with an overview of the RIA of different optical fibre types under several irradiation conditions. Possibilities For The LAGUNA Projects At The FrÃ©jus Site NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mosca, Luigi 2010-11-01 The present laboratory (LSM) at the FrÃ©jus site and the project of a first extension of it, mainly aimed at the next generation of dark matter and double beta decay experiments, are briefly reviewed. Then the main characteristics of the LAGUNA cooperation and Design Study network are summarized. Seven underground sites in Europe are considered in LAGUNA and are under study as candidates for the installation of Megaton scale detectors using three different techniques: a liquid Argon TPC (GLACIER), a liquid scintillator detector (LENA) and a Water Cerenkov (MEMPHYS), all mainly aimed at investigation of proton decay and properties of neutrinos from SuperNovae and other astrophysical sources as well as from accelerators (Super-beams and/or Beta-beams from CERN). One of the seven sites is located at FrÃ©jus, near the present LSM laboratory, and the results of its feasibility study are presented and discussed. Then the physics potential of a MEMPHYS detector installed in this site are emphasized both for non-accelerator and for neutrino beam based configurations. The MEMPHYNO prototype with its R&D programme is presented. Finally a possible schedule is sketched. Offering Global Collaboration Services beyond CERN and HEP NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Fernandes, J.; Ferreira, P.; Baron, T. 2015-12-01 The CERN IT department has built over the years a performant and integrated ecosystem of collaboration tools, from videoconference and webcast services to event management software. These services have been designed and evolved in very close collaboration with the various communities surrounding the laboratory and have been massively adopted by CERN users. To cope with this very heavy usage, global infrastructures have been deployed which take full advantage of CERN's international and global nature. If these services and tools are instrumental in enabling the worldwide collaboration which generates major HEP breakthroughs, they would certainly also benefit other sectors of science in which globalization has already taken place. Some of these services are driven by commercial software (Vidyo or Wowza for example), some others have been developed internally and have already been made available to the world as Open Source Software in line with CERN's spirit and mission. Indico for example is now installed in 100+ institutes worldwide. But providing the software is often not enough and institutes, collaborations and project teams do not always possess the expertise, or human or material resources that are needed to set up and maintain such services. Regional and national institutions have to answer needs, which are growingly global and often contradict their operational capabilities or organizational mandate and so are looking at existing worldwide service offers such as CERN's. We believe that the accumulated experience obtained through the operation of a large scale worldwide collaboration service combined with CERN's global network and its recently- deployed Agile Infrastructure would allow the Organization to set up and operate collaborative services, such as Indico and Vidyo, at a much larger scale and on behalf of worldwide research and education institutions and thus answer these pressing demands while optimizing resources at a global level. Such services would be built over a robust and massively scalable Indico server to which the concept of communities would be added, and which would then serve as a hub for accessing other collaboration services such as Vidyo, on the same simple and successful model currently in place for CERN users. This talk will describe this vision, its benefits and the steps that have already been taken to make it come to life. A facility to search for hidden particles at the CERN SPS: the SHiP physics case.

The SHiP (search for hidden particles) experiment is intended to hunt for new physics in the largely unexplored domain of very weakly interacting particles with masses below the Fermi scale, inaccessible to the LHC experiments, and to study tau neutrino physics. The same proton beam setup can be used later to look for decays of tau-leptons with lepton flavour number non-conservation, [Formula: see text] and to search for weakly-interacting sub-GeV dark matter candidates. We discuss the evidence for physics beyond the standard model and describe interactions between new particles and four different portals-scalars, vectors, fermions or axion-like particles. We discuss motivations for different models, manifesting themselves via these interactions, and how they can be probed with the SHiP experiment and present several case studies. The prospects to search for relatively light SUSY and composite particles at SHiP are also discussed. We demonstrate that the SHiP experiment has a unique potential to discover new physics and can directly probe a number of solutions of beyond the standard model puzzles, such as neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry of the Universe, dark matter, and inflation. Evaluation results of xTCA equipment for HEP experiments at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Di Cosmo, M.; Bobillier, V.; Haas, S.; Joos, M.; Mico, S.; Vasey, F.; Vichoudis, P. 2013-12-01 The MicroTCA and AdvancedTCA industry standards are candidate modular electronic platforms for the upgrade of the current generation of high energy physics experiments. The PH-ESE group at CERN launched in 2011 the xTCA evaluation project with the aim of performing technical evaluations and eventually providing support for commercially available components. Different devices from different vendors have been acquired, evaluated and interoperability tests have been performed. This paper presents the test procedures and facilities that have been developed and focuses on the evaluation results including electrical, thermal and interoperability aspects. « 7 8 9 10 11 » « 8 9 10 11 12 » EDITORIAL: Lectures from the European RTN Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories, CERN, 21 25 January 2008 NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Derendinger, J.-P.; Orlando, D.; Uranga, A. 2008-11-01 This special issue is devoted to the proceedings of the conference 'RTN Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories', which took place at CERN, the European Centre for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzerland, on the 21 25 January 2008. This event was organized in the framework of the European Mobility Research and Training Network entitled 'Constituents, Fundamental Forces and Symmetries of the Universe'. It is part of a yearly series of scientific schools, which represents what is by now a well established tradition. The previous ones have been held at SISSA, in Trieste, Italy, in February 2005 and at CERN in January 2006. The next one will again take place at CERN, in February 2009. The school was primarily meant for young doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers working in the area of string theory. It consisted of several general lectures of four hours each, whose notes are published in the present proceedings, and five working group discussion sessions, focused on specific topics of the network research program. It was attended by approximatively 250 participants. The topics of the lectures were chosen to provide an introduction to some of the areas of recent progress, and to the open problems, in string theory. One of the most active areas in string theory in recent years is the AdS/CFT or gauge/gravity correspondence, which proposes the complete equivalence of string theory on (asymptotically) anti-de Sitter spacetimes with gauge theories. The duality relates the weak coupling regime of one system to the strongly coupled regime of the other, and is therefore very non-trivial to test beyond the supersymmetry-protected BPS sector. One of the key ideas to quantitatively match several quantities on both sides is the use of integrability, both in the gauge theory and the string side. The lecture notes by Nick Dorey provide a pedagogical introduction to the fascinating topic of integrability in AdS/CFT. On the string theory side, progress has been limited by the difficulties of quantizing the worldsheet theory in the presence of RR backgrounds. There is increasing hope that these difficulties can be overcome, using the pure spinor formulation of string theory. The lectures by Yaron Oz overview the present status of this proposal. The gauge/gravity correspondence is already leading to important insights into questions of quantum gravity, like the entropy of black holes and its interpretation in terms of microstates. These questions can be addressed in string theory, for certain classes of supersymmetric black holes. The lectures by Vijay Balasubramanian, Jan de Boer, Sheer El-Showk and Ilies Messamah review recent progress in this direction. Throughout the years, formal developments in string theory have systematically led to improved understanding on how it may relate to nature. In this respect, the lectures by Henning Samtleben describe how the formal developments on gauged supergravities can be used to describe compactification vacua in string theory, and their implications for moduli stabilization and supersymmetry breaking. Indeed, softly broken supersymmetry is one of the leading proposals to describe particle physics at the TeV energy range, as described in the lectures by Gian Giudice (not covered in this issue). This connection with TeV scale physics is most appropriate and timely, given that this energy range will shortly become experimentally accessible in the LHC at CERN. The conference was financially supported by the European Commission under contract MRTN-CT-2004-005104 and by CERN. It was jointly organized by the Physics Institute of the University of NeuchÃ¢tel and the Theory Unit of the Physics Division of CERN. It is a great pleasure for us to warmly thank the Theory Unit of CERN for its very kind hospitality and for the high quality of the assistance and the infrastructure that it has provided. We also acknowledge helpful administrative assistance from the Physics Institute of the University of NeuchÃ¢tel. Special thanks also go to Denis Frank, for his very valuable help in preparing the conference web pages.

The latest test has seen particle physics grid sites in the UK exchanging data at high Laser resonance ionization spectroscopy on lutetium for the MEDICIS project NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Gadelshin, V.; Cocolios, T.; Fedoseev, V.; Heinke, R.; Kieck, T.; Marsh, B.; Naubereit, P.; Rothe, S.; Stora, T.; Studer, D.; Van Duppen, P.; Wendt, K. 2017-11-01 The MEDICIS-PROMED Innovative Training Network under the Horizon 2020 EU program aims to establish a network of early stage researchers, involving scientific exchange and active cooperation between leading European research institutions, universities, hospitals, and industry. Primary scientific goal is the purpose of providing and testing novel radioisotopes for nuclear medical imaging and radionuclide therapy. Within a closely linked project at CERN, a dedicated electromagnetic mass separator system is presently under installation for production of innovative radiopharmaceutical isotopes at the new CERN-MEDICIS laboratory, directly adjacent to the existing CERN-ISOLDE radioactive ion beam facility. It is planned to implement a resonance ionization laser ion source (RILIS) to ensure high efficiency and unrivaled purity in the production of radioactive ions. To provide a highly efficient ionization process, identification and characterization of a specific multi-step laser ionization scheme for each individual element with isotopes of interest is required. The element lutetium is of primary relevance, and therefore was considered as first candidate. Three two-step excitation schemes for lutetium atoms are presented in this work, and spectroscopic results are compared with data of other authors. Techniques for hazard analysis and their use at CERN. PubMed Nuttall, C; SchÃ¶nbacher, H 2001-01-01 CERN, The European Organisation for Nuclear Research is situated near Geneva and has its accelerators and experimental facilities astride the Swiss and French frontiers attracting physicists from all over the world to this unique laboratory. The main accelerator is situated in a 27 km underground ring and the experiments take place in huge underground caverns in order to detect the fragments resulting from the collision of subatomic particles at speeds approaching that of light. These detectors contain many hundreds of tons of flammable materials, mainly plastics in cables and structural components, flammable gases in the detectors themselves, and cryogenic fluids such as helium and argon. The experiments consume high amounts of electrical power, thus the dangers involved have necessitated the use of analytical techniques to identify the hazards and quantify the risks to personnel and the infrastructure. The techniques described in the paper have been developed in the process industries where they have been to be of great value. They have been successfully applied to CERN industrial and experimental installations and, in some cases, have been instrumental in changing the philosophy of the experimentalists and their detectors. Raymond Stora's obituary NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Becchi, C. 2015-10-01 On Monday, July 20, 2015 Raymond Stora passed away; although he was seriously ill, his death was unexpected, the result of a sudden heart attack. Raymond was born on September 18, 1930. He had been sick for many months, yet continued to go to CERN where he was able to discuss the problems in physics and mathematics that interested him. In fact, his last publication (recorded on SPIRES) carries the date of December 2014, just before he contracted pneumonia, which dramatically reduced his mobility and hence the possibility of going to CERN. Still, this last project revived Raymond's interest in algebraic curves, and he spent a large part of his last months at home reading papers and books on this subject. In 2013, despite the large amount of time that his various therapies required, Raymond made a fundamental contribution to a difficult problem on renormalization in configuration space based on the subtle technical properties of homogeneous distributions. His knowledge of physics and, in particular, of quantum field theory, as well as of many fields of mathematics was so well known that many members of and visitors to CERN frequently asked Raymond for advice and assistance, which he gave with great enthusiasm and in the most gracious way. Ivan Todorov, commenting on Raymond's death, noted that we must remember Raymond's remarkable qualities, which were both human and scientific. Internet end-to-end performance monitoring for the High Energy Nuclear and Particle Physics community DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Matthews, W. 2000-02-22 Modern High Energy Nuclear and Particle Physics (HENP) experiments at Laboratories around the world present a significant challenge to wide area networks. Petabytes (1015) or exabytes (1018) of data will be generated during the lifetime of the experiment. Much of this data will be distributed via the Internet to the experiment's collaborators at Universities and Institutes throughout the world for analysis. In order to assess the feasibility of the computing goals of these and future experiments, the HENP networking community is actively monitoring performance across a large part of the Internet used by its collaborators. Since 1995, the pingER projectmoreÂ Â» has been collecting data on ping packet loss and round trip times. In January 2000, there are 28 monitoring sites in 15 countries gathering data on over 2,000 end-to-end pairs. HENP labs such as SLAC, Fermi Lab and CERN are using Advanced Network's Surveyor project and monitoring performance from one-way delay of UDP packets. More recently several HENP sites have become involved with NLANR's active measurement program (AMP). In addition SLAC and CERN are part of the RIPE test-traffic project and SLAC is home for a NIMI machine. The large End-to-end performance monitoring infrastructure allows the HENP networking community to chart long term trends and closely examine short term glitches across a wide range of networks and connections. The different methodologies provide opportunities to compare results based on different protocols and statistical samples. Understanding agreement and discrepancies between results provides particular insight into the nature of the network. This paper will highlight the practical side of monitoring by reviewing the special needs of High Energy Nuclear and Particle Physics experiments and provide an overview of the experience of measuring performance across a large number of interconnected networks throughout the world with various methodologies. In particular, results from each project will be compared and disagreement will be analyzed. The goal is to address issues for improving understanding for gathering and analysis of accurate monitoring data, but the outlook for the computing goals of HENP will also be examined.Â«Â less Experimental High Energy Physics Research DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Hohlmann, Marcus This final report summarizes activities of the Florida Tech High Energy Physics group supported by DOE under grant #DE-SC0008024 during the period June 2012 â March 2015. We focused on one of the main HEP research thrusts at the Energy Frontier by participating in the CMS experiment. We were exploiting the tremendous physics opportunities at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and prepared for physics at its planned extension, the High-Luminosity LHC. The effort comprised a physics component with analysis of data from the first LHC run and contributions to the CMS Phase-2 upgrades in the muon endcap system (EMU) formoreÂ Â» the High-Luminosity LHC. The emphasis of our hardware work was the development of large-area Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) for the CMS forward muon upgrade. We built a production and testing site for such detectors at Florida Tech to complement future chamber production at CERN. The first full-scale CMS GE1/1 chamber prototype ever built outside of CERN was constructed at Florida Tech in summer 2013. We conducted two beam tests with GEM prototype chambers at CERN in 2012 and at FNAL in 2013 and reported the results at conferences and in publications. Principal Investigator Hohlmann served as chair of the collaboration board of the CMS GEM collaboration and as co-coordinator of the GEM detector working group. He edited and authored sections of the detector chapter of the Technical Design Report (TDR) for the GEM muon upgrade, which was approved by the LHCC and the CERN Research Board in 2015. During the course of the TDR approval process, the GEM project was also established as an official subsystem of the muon system by the CMS muon institution board. On the physics side, graduate student Kalakhety performed a Z' search in the dimuon channel with the 2011 and 2012 CMS datasets that utilized 20.6 fbâ»Â¹ of p-p collisions at âs = 8 TeV. For the dimuon channel alone, the 95% CL lower limits obtained on the mass of a Z' resonance are 2770 GeV for a Z' with the same standard-model couplings as the Z boson. Our student team operated a Tier-3 cluster on the Open Science Grid (OSG) to support local CMS physics analysis and remote OSG activity. As a service to the HEP community, Hohlmann participated in the Snowmass effort over the course of 2013. Specifically, he acted as a liaison for gaseous detectors between the Instrumentation Frontier and the Energy Frontier and contributed to five papers and reports submitted to the summer study.Â«Â less UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS PROGRAM DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Rutherfoord, John P.; Johns, Kenneth A.; Shupe, Michael A. 2013-07-29 The High Energy Physics Group at the University of Arizona has conducted forefront research in elementary particle physics. Our theorists have developed new ideas in lattice QCD, SUSY phenomenology, string theory phenomenology, extra spatial dimensions, dark matter, and neutrino astrophysics. The experimentalists produced significant physics results on the ATLAS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider and on the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron. In addition, the experimentalists were leaders in detector development and construction, and on service roles in these experiments. Towards a Future Linear Collider and The Linear Collider Studies at CERN ScienceCinema Heuer, Rolf-Dieter 2018-06-15 During the week 18-22 October, more than 400 physicists will meet at CERN and in the CICG (International Conference Centre Geneva) to review the global progress towards a future linear collider.

Evaluation of the Huawei UDS cloud storage system for CERN specific data NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zotes Resines, M.; Heikkila, S. S.; Duellmann, D.; Adde, G.; Toebbicke, R.; Hughes, J.; Wang, L. 2014-06-01 Cloud storage is an emerging architecture aiming to provide increased scalability and access performance, compared to more traditional solutions. CERN is evaluating this promise using Huawei UDS and OpenStack SWIFT storage deployments, focusing on the needs of high-energy physics. Both deployed setups implement S3, one of the protocols that are emerging as a standard in the cloud storage market. A set of client machines is used to generate I/O load patterns to evaluate the storage system performance. The presented read and write test results indicate scalability both in metadata and data perspectives. Futher the Huawei UDS cloud storage is shown to be able to recover from a major failure of losing 16 disks. Both cloud storages are finally demonstrated to function as back-end storage systems to a filesystem, which is used to deliver high energy physics software.

NEWS: A trip to CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ellison, A. D. 2000-07-01 Two years ago John Kinchin and myself were lucky enough to attend the Goldsmith's particle physics course. As well as many interesting lectures and activities, this course included a visit to CERN. To most physics teachers CERN is Mecca, a hallowed place where gods manipulate and manufacture matter. The experience of being there was even better. Alison Wright was an enthusiastic and very knowledgeable host who ensured the visit went smoothly and we all learned a lot. While we were there, John and I discussed the possibility of bringing a party of A-level students to see real physics in action. In February of this year we managed it. 33 students from two schools, Boston Grammar School and Northampton School for Boys, and four staff left England and caught the 2Ã am ferry to France. Many hours and a few `short cuts' later we arrived at our hotel in St Genis, not far from CERN. The first day was spent sight-seeing in Lausanne and Geneva. The Olympic museum in Lausanne is well worth a visit. Unfortunately, the famous fountain in Geneva was turned off, but then you can't have everything. The following morning we turned up at CERN late due to the coach's brakes being iced up! We were met once again by Alison Wright who forgave us and introduced the visit by giving an excellent talk on CERN, its background and its reason for existing. At this point we met another member of our Goldsmith's course and his students so we joined forces once again. We then piled back into the coach to re-cross the border and visit ALEPH. ALEPH is a monster of a detector 150Ã m below ground. We divided into four groups, each with a very able and knowledgeable guide, and toured the site. The size and scale of the detector are awesome and the students were suitably impressed. We repeated the speed of sound experiment of two years ago at the bottom of a 150Ã m concrete shaft (320 mÃ s-1), posed for a group photo in front of the detector (figureÃ 1) and returned to the main site for lunch in the canteen. Over lunch we mixed with physicists of many different nationalities and backgrounds. Figure 1 Figure 1. In the afternoon we visited Microcosm, the CERN visitors centre, and the LEP control room and also the SPS. Here the students learned new applications for much of the physics of standing waves and resonance that they had been taught in the classroom. Later that night, we visited a bowling alley where momentum and collision theory were put into practice. The following morning we returned to CERN and visited the large magnet testing facility. Here again physics was brought to life. We saw superconducting magnets being assembled and tested and the students gained a real appreciation of the problems and principles involved. The afternoon was rounded off by a visit to a science museum in Geneva - well worth a visit, as some of us still use some of the apparatus on display. Friday was our last full day so we visited Chamonix in the northern Alps. In the morning, we ascended the Aiguille de Midi - by cable car. Twenty minutes and 3842Ã m later we emerged into 50Ã kmÃ h-1 winds and -10Ã ÃÂ°C temperature, not counting the -10Ã ÃÂ°C wind chill factor. A crisp packet provided an unusual demonstration of the effects of air pressure (figureÃ 2). Figure 2 Figure 2. The views from the summit were very spectacular though a few people experienced mild altitude sickness. That afternoon the party went to the Mer de Glace. Being inside a 3Ã million year-old structure moving down a mountain at 3Ã cm per day was an interesting experience, as was a tot of whisky with 3Ã million year-old water. Once again the local scenery was very photogenic and the click and whirr of cameras was a constant background noise. Saturday morning saw an early start for the long drive home. Most students - and some staff - took the opportunity to catch up on their sleep. Thanks are due to many people without whom the trip would never have taken place. Anne Craige, Stuart Williams, Christine Sutton and Andrew Morrison of PPARC, but most especially Alison Wright of CERN and John Kinchin of Boston Grammar School who did all the hard work and organization. The week gave students a unique chance to see the principles of physics being applied in many different ways and I am sure this has reinforced their knowledge and understanding. Some students also took the opportunity to practise their language skills. The only remaining question is: what next? I'll have to think about it in the summer when I have some slack time. Hmm, SLAC, that gives me an idea....

DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Peskin, Michael E.; /SLAC New arguments based on astrophysical phenomena constrain the possibility that dangerous black holes will be produced at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. On 8 August, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN injected its first beams, beginning an experimental program that will produce proton-proton collisions at an energy of 14 TeV. Particle physicists are waiting expectantly. The reason is that the Standard Model of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions, despite its many successes, is clearly incomplete. Theory says that the holes in the model should be filled by new physics in the energy region that will be studied by themoreÂ Â» LHC. Some candidate theories are simple quick fixes, but the most interesting ones involve new concepts of spacetime waiting to be discovered. Look up the LHC on Wikipedia, however, and you will find considerable space devoted to safety concerns. At the LHC, we will probe energies beyond those explored at any previous accelerator, and we hope to create particles that have never been observed. Couldn't we, then, create particles that would actually be dangerous, for example, ones that would eat normal matter and eventually turn the earth into a blob of unpleasantness? It is morbid fun to speculate about such things, and candidates for such dangerous particles have been suggested. These suggestions have been analyzed in an article in Reviews of Modern Physics by Jaffe, Busza, Wilczek, and Sandweiss and excluded on the basis of constraints from observation and from the known laws of physics. These conclusions have been upheld by subsequent studies conducted at CERN.Â«Â less [The CERN and the megascience]. PubMed Aguilar Peris, JosÃ© 2006-01-01 In this work we analyse the biggest particle accelerator in the world: the LHC (Large Hadron Collider). The ring shaped tunnel is 27 km long and it is buried over 110 meters underground, straddling the border betwen France and Switzerland at the CERN laboratory near Geneva. Its mission is to recreate the conditions that existed shortly after the Big-Bang and to look for the hypothesised Higgs particle. The LHC will accelerate protons near the speed of the light and collide them head on at an energy of to 14 TeV (1 TeV = 10(12) eV). Keeping such high energy in the proton beams requires enormous magnetic fields which are generated by superconducting electromagnets chilled to less than two degrees above absolute zero. It is expected that LHC will be inaugurated in summer 2007. Final Report: High Energy Physics at the Energy Frontier at Louisiana Tech DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Sawyer, Lee; Wobisch, Markus; Greenwood, Zeno D. The Louisiana Tech University High Energy Physics group has developed a research program aimed at experimentally testing the Standard Model of particle physics and searching for new phenomena through a focused set of analyses in collaboration with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva. This research program includes involvement in the current operation and maintenance of the ATLAS experiment and full involvement in Phase 1 and Phase 2 upgrades in preparation for future high luminosity (HL-LHC) operation of the LHC. Our focus is solely on the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, withmoreÂ Â» some related detector development and software efforts. We have established important service roles on ATLAS in five major areas: Triggers, especially jet triggers; Data Quality monitoring; grid computing; GPU applications for upgrades; and radiation testing for upgrades. Our physics research is focused on multijet measurements and top quark physics in final states containing tau leptons, which we propose to extend into related searches for new phenomena. Focusing on closely related topics in the jet and top analyses and coordinating these analyses in our group has led to high efficiency and increased visibility inside the ATLAS collaboration and beyond. Based on our work in the DÃ experiment in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, Louisiana Tech has developed a reputation as one of the leading institutions pursuing jet physics studies. Currently we are applying this expertise to the ATLAS experiment, with several multijet analyses in progress.Â«Â less Heavy-ion physics with the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. PubMed Schukraft, J 2012-02-28 After close to 20 years of preparation, the dedicated heavy-ion experiment A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) took first data at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerator with proton collisions at the end of 2009 and with lead nuclei at the end of 2010. After a short introduction into the physics of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, this article recalls the main design choices made for the detector and summarizes the initial operation and performance of ALICE. Physics results from this first year of operation concentrate on characterizing the global properties of typical, average collisions, both in proton-proton (pp) and nucleus-nucleus reactions, in the new energy regime of the LHC. The pp results differ, to a varying degree, from most quantum chromodynamics-inspired phenomenological models and provide the input needed to fine tune their parameters. First results from Pb-Pb are broadly consistent with expectations based on lower energy data, indicating that high-density matter created at the LHC, while much hotter and larger, still behaves like a very strongly interacting, almost perfect liquid. DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Fernandez T, Arturo The use of the sophisticated and large underground detectors at CERN for cosmic ray studies has been considered by several groups, e.g. UA1, LEP and LHC detectors. They offer the opportunity to provide large sensitivity area with magnetic analysis which allow a precise determination of the direction of cosmic ray muons as well as their momentum up to the order of some TeV. The aim of this article is to review the observation of high energy cosmic ray muons using precise spectrometers at CERN, mainly LEP detectors as well as the possibility of improve those measurements with LHC apparatus, givingmoreÂ Â» special emphasis to the ACORDE-ALICE cosmic ray physics program.Â«Â less Antiproton Trapping for Advanced Space Propulsion Applications NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Smith, Gerald A. 1998-01-01 The Summary of Research parallels the Statement of Work (Appendix I) submitted with the proposal, and funded effective Feb. 1, 1997 for one year. A proposal was submitted to CERN in October, 1996 to carry out an experiment on the synthesis and study of fundamental properties of atomic antihydrogen. Since confined atomic antihydrogen is potentially the most powerful and elegant source of propulsion energy known, its confinement and properties are of great interest to the space propulsion community. Appendix II includes an article published in the technical magazine Compressed Air, June 1997, which describes CERN antiproton facilities, and ATHENA. During the period of this grant, Prof. Michael Holzscheiter served as spokesman for ATHENA and, in collaboration with Prof. Gerald Smith, worked on the development of the antiproton confinement trap, which is an important part of the ATHENA experiment. Appendix III includes a progress report submitted to CERN on March 12, 1997 concerning development of the ATHENA detector. Section 4.1 reviews technical responsibilities within the ATHENA collaboration, including the Antiproton System, headed by Prof. Holzscheiter. The collaboration was advised (see Appendix IV) on June 13, 1997 that the CERN Research Board had approved ATHENA for operation at the new Antiproton Decelerator (AD), presently under construction. First antiproton beams are expected to be delivered to experiments in about one year. Progress toward assembly of the ATHENA detector and initial testing expected in 1999 has been excellent. Appendix V includes a copy of the minutes of the most recently documented collaboration meeting held at CERN of October 24, 1997, which provides more information on development of systems, including the antiproton trapping apparatus. On February 10, 1998 Prof. Smith gave a 3 hour lecture on the Physics of Antimatter, as part of the Physics for the Third Millennium Lecture Series held at MSFC. Included in Appendix VI are notes and graphs presented on the ATHENA experiment. Portable antiproton trap has been under development. The goal is to store and transport antiprotons from a production site, such as Fermilab near Chicago, to a distant site, such as Huntsville, AL, thus demonstrating the portability of antiprotons. Disk storage at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mascetti, L.; Cano, E.; Chan, B.; Espinal, X.; Fiorot, A.; GonzÃ¡lez Labrador, H.; Iven, J.; Lamanna, M.; Lo Presti, G.; MoÅcicki, JT; Peters, AJ; Ponce, S.; Rousseau, H.; van der Ster, D. 2015-12-01 CERN IT DSS operates the main storage resources for data taking and physics analysis mainly via three system: AFS, CASTOR and EOS. The total usable space available on disk for users is about 100 PB (with relative ratios 1:20:120). EOS actively uses the two CERN Tier0 centres (Meyrin and Wigner) with 50:50 ratio. IT DSS also provide sizeable on-demand resources for IT services most notably OpenStack and NFS-based clients: this is provided by a Ceph infrastructure (3 PB) and few proprietary servers (NetApp). We will describe our operational experience and recent changes to these systems with special emphasis to the present usages for LHC data taking, the convergence to commodity hardware (nodes with 200-TB each with optional SSD) shared across all services. We also describe our experience in coupling commodity and home-grown solution (e.g. CERNBox integration in EOS, Ceph disk pools for AFS, CASTOR and NFS) and finally the future evolution of these systems for WLCG and beyond. « 8 9 10 11 12 » « 9 10 11 12 13 » First experimental evidence of hydrodynamic tunneling of ultra-relativistic protons in extended solid copper target at the CERN HiRadMat facility NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Schmidt, R.; Blanco Sancho, J.; Burkart, F.; Grenier, D.; Wollmann, D.; Tahir, N. A.; Shutov, A.; Piriz, A. R. 2014-08-01 A novel experiment has been performed at the CERN HiRadMat test facility to study the impact of the 440 GeV proton beam generated by the Super Proton Synchrotron on extended solid copper cylindrical targets. Substantial hydrodynamic tunneling of the protons in the target material has been observed that leads to significant lengthening of the projectile range, which confirms our previous theoretical predictions [N. A. Tahir et al., Phys. Rev. Spec. Top.-Accel. Beams 15, 051003 (2012)]. Simulation results show very good agreement with the experimental measurements. These results have very important implications on the machine protection design for powerful machines like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the future High Luminosity LHC, and the proposed huge 80 km circumference Future Circular Collider, which is currently being discussed at CERN. Another very interesting outcome of this work is that one may also study the field of High Energy Density Physics at this test facility. Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 4. Deciphering the Nature of the Higgs Sector DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) de Florian, D. This Report summarizes the results of the activities of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group in the period 2014-2016. The main goal of the working group was to present the state-of-the-art of Higgs physics at the LHC, integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. The first part compiles the most up-to-date predictions of Higgs boson production cross sections and decay branching ratios, parton distribution functions, and off-shell Higgs boson production and interference effects. The second part discusses the recent progress in Higgs effective field theory predictions, followed by the third part on pseudo-observables, simplifiedmoreÂ Â» template cross section and fiducial cross section measurements, which give the baseline framework for Higgs boson property measurements. The fourth part deals with the beyond the Standard Model predictions of various benchmark scenarios of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, extended scalar sector, Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and exotic Higgs boson decays. This report follows three previous working-group reports: Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002), Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 2. Differential Distributions (CERN-2012-002), and Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 3. Higgs properties (CERN-2013-004). The current report serves as the baseline reference for Higgs physics in LHC Run 2 and beyond.Â«Â less SHiP: a new facility with a dedicated detector to search for new neutral particles and studying tau neutrino properties NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Shevchenko, V. 2017-12-01 SHiP (Search for Hidden Particles) is a new general purpose fixed target facility, whose Technical Proposal has been recently reviewed by the CERN SPS Committee and by the CERN Research Board. The two boards recommended that the experiment proceeds further to a Comprehensive Design phase in the context of the new CERNWorking group \"Physics Beyond Colliders\", aiming at presenting a CERN strategy for the European Strategy meeting of 2019. In the initial phase of SHiP, the 400 GeV proton beam extracted from the SPS will be dumped on a heavy target with the aim of integrating 2Ã1020 pot in 5 years. A dedicated detector, based on a long vacuum tank followed by a spectrometer and particle identification detectors, will allow probing a variety of models with light long-lived exotic particles and masses below O(10) GeV/c2. The main focus will be the physics of the so-called Hidden Portals, i.e. search for Dark Photons, Light scalars and pseudo-scalars, and Heavy Neutrinos. The sensitivity to Heavy Neutrinos will allow for the first time to probe, in the mass range between the kaon and the charm meson mass, a coupling range for which Baryogenesis and active neutrino masses could also be explained. Another dedicated detector will allow the study of neutrino cross-sections and angular distributions.

Physics at the SPS. PubMed Gatignon, L 2018-05-01 The CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) has delivered a variety of beams to a vigorous fixed target physics program since 1978. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the description of a few illustrative examples in the ongoing physics program at the SPS. We will outline the physics aims of the COmmon Muon Proton Apparatus for Structure and Spectroscopy (COMPASS), north area 64 (NA64), north area 62 (NA62), north area 61 (NA61), and advanced proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiment (AWAKE). COMPASS studies the structure of the proton and more specifically of its spin. NA64 searches for the dark photon A', which is the messenger for interactions between normal and dark matter. The NA62 experiment aims at a 10% precision measurement of the very rare decay K + â Ï + Î½Î½. As this decay mode can be calculated very precisely in the Standard Model, it offers a very good opportunity to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The NA61/SHINE experiment studies the phase transition to Quark Gluon Plasma, a state in which the quarks and gluons that form the proton and the neutron are de-confined. Finally, AWAKE investigates proton-driven wake field acceleration: a promising technique to accelerate electrons with very high accelerating gradients. The Physics Beyond Colliders study at CERN is paving the way for a significant and diversified continuation of this already rich and compelling physics program that is complementary to the one at the big colliders like the Large Hadron Collider.

Next Generation Workload Management and Analysis System for Big Data DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) De, Kaushik We report on the activities and accomplishments of a four-year project (a three-year grant followed by a one-year no cost extension) to develop a next generation workload management system for Big Data. The new system is based on the highly successful PanDA software developed for High Energy Physics (HEP) in 2005. PanDA is used by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and the AMS experiment at the space station. The program of work described here was carried out by two teams of developers working collaboratively at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the University of Texas at ArlingtonmoreÂ Â» (UTA). These teams worked closely with the original PanDA team â for the sake of clarity the work of the next generation team will be referred to as the BigPanDA project. Their work has led to the adoption of BigPanDA by the COMPASS experiment at CERN, and many other experiments and science projects worldwide.Â«Â less ENLIGHT and other EU-funded projects in hadron therapy.

PMID:20846982 Lectures from the European RTN Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories, CERN, 16 20 January, 2006 NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Derendinger, J.-P.; Scrucca, C. A.; Uranga, A. M. 2006-11-01 This special issue is devoted to the proceedings of the conference 'Winter School on Strings, Supergravity and Gauge Theories', which took place at CERN, the European Centre for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzerland, from the 16 to the 20 of January 2006. This event was organized in the framework of the European Mobility Research and Training Network entitled 'Constituents, Fundamental Forces and Symmetries of the Universe'. It is part of a yearly series of scientific schools which have become a traditional rendezvous for young researchers of the community. The previous one was held at SISSA, in Trieste, Italy, in February 2005, and the next one will take place again at CERN, in January 2007. The school was primarily meant for young doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers working in the area of string theory. It consisted of five general lectures of four hours each, whose notes are published in the present proceedings, and five working group discussion sessions, focused on specific topics of the network research program. It was attended by approximately 250 participants. The topics of the lectures were chosen to provide an introduction to some of the areas of recent progress and to the open problems in string theory. String theory is expected to provide insights into the description of systems where the role of gravity is crucial. One prominent example of such systems are time-dependent backgrounds with big bang singularities, whose status in string theory is reviewed in the lecture notes by Ben Craps. In another main problem in quantum gravity, string theory gives a fascinating microscopic description of black holes and their properties. The lectures by Shiraz Minwalla review the thermal properties of black holes from their microscopic description in terms of a holographically dual large N field theory. Progress in the description of black hole microstates, and its interplay with the macroscopic description in terms of supergravity solutions via the attractor mechanism, are covered by the lectures by Atish Dabholkar and Boris Pioline. A final important mainstream topic in string theory, being a higher-dimensional theory, is its compactification to four dimensions, and the computation of four-dimensional physical properties in terms of the properties of the internal space. The lectures by Mariana GraÃ±a review recent progress in the classification of the most general supersymmetric backgrounds describing the compactified dimensions, and their role in determining the number of massless scalar moduli fields in four dimensions. The conference was financially supported by the European Commission under contract MRTN-CT-2004-005104 and by CERN. It was jointly organized by the Physics Institute of the University of NeuchÃ¢tel and the Theory Unit of the Physics Division of CERN. It is a great pleasure for us to warmly thank the Theory Unit of CERN for its very kind hospitality and for the high quality of the services and infrastructure that it has provided. We also acknowledge helpful administrative assistance from the Physics Institute of the University of NeuchÃ¢tel. Special thanks go finally to Denis Frank for his very valuable help in preparing the conference web pages, and to J Rostant, A-M Perrin and M-S Vascotto for their continuous and very reliable assistance.

Matter, Energy, Space and Time: The International Linear Collider Physics Prospects and International Aspects NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wagner, Albrecht 2006-04-01 Over the past century, physicists have sought to explain the character of the matter and energy in our universe, to show how the basic forces of nature and the building blocks of matter come about, and to explore the fabric of space and time. In the past three decades, experiments at laboratories around the world have given us a precise confirmation of the underlying theory called the standard model. These particle physics advances have a direct impact for our understanding of the structure of the universe, both at its inception in the Big Bang, and in its evolution to the present and future. The final synthesis is not yet fully clear, but we know with confidence that major discoveries expanding the standard model framework will occur at the next generation of accelerators. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) being built at CERN will take us into the discovery realm. The proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) will extend the discoveries and provide a wealth of precision measurements that are essential for giving deeper understanding of their meaning, and pointing the way to further evolution of particle physics in the future. A world-wide consensus has formed for a baseline ILC project at energies of 500 GeV and beyond. The choice of the superconducting technology as basis for the ILC has paved the way for a global design effort which has now taken full speed. Evolution of optical fibre cabling components at CERN: Performance and technology trends analysis NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Shoaie, Mohammad Amin; Meroli, Stefano; Machado, Simao; Ricci, Daniel 2018-05-01 CERN optical fibre infrastructure has been growing constantly over the past decade due to ever increasing connectivity demands. The provisioning plan and fibre installation of this vast laboratory is performed by Fibre Optics and Cabling Section at Engineering Department. In this paper we analyze the procurement data for essential fibre cabling components during a five-year interval to extract the existing trends and anticipate future directions. The analysis predicts high contribution of LC connector and an increasing usage of multi-fibre connectors. It is foreseen that single-mode fibres become the main fibre type for mid and long-range installations while air blowing would be the major installation technique. Performance assessment of various connectors shows that the expanded beam ferrule is favored for emerging on-board optical interconnections thanks to its scalable density and stable return-loss.

In a laboratory magnetic field (\"axion helioscope\"), they would be transformed into x-rays with energies of a few keV. Using a decommissioned Large Hadron Collider test magnet, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope ran for about 6 months during 2003. The first results from the analysis of these data are presented here. No signal above background was observed, implying an upper limit to the axion-photon coupling g(agamma)<1.16x10(-10) GeV-1 at 95% C.L. for m(a) less, similar 0.02 eV. This limit, assumption-free, is comparable to the limit from stellar energy-loss arguments and considerably more restrictive than any previous experiment over a broad range of axion masses. PanDA for COMPASS at JINR NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Petrosyan, A. Sh. 2016-09-01 PanDA (Production and Distributed Analysis System) is a workload management system, widely used for data processing at experiments on Large Hadron Collider and others. COMPASS is a high-energy physics experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron. Data processing for COMPASS runs locally at CERN, on lxbatch, the data itself stored in CASTOR. In 2014 an idea to start running COMPASS production through PanDA arose. Such transformation in experiment's data processing will allow COMPASS community to use not only CERN resources, but also Grid resources worldwide. During the spring and summer of 2015 installation, validation and migration work is being performed at JINR. Details and results of this process are presented in this paper. « 9 10 11 12 13 » « 10 11 12 13 14 » The beam and detector of the NA62 experiment at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cortina Gil, E.; MartÃ­n AlbarrÃ¡n, E.; Minucci, E.; NÃ¼ssle, G.; Padolski, S.; Petrov, P.; Szilasi, N.; Velghe, B.; Georgiev, G.; Kozhuharov, V.; Litov, L.; Husek, T.; Kampf, K.; Zamkovsky, M.; Aliberti, R.; Geib, K.

An X-ray tomograph has been developed, designed and constructed at CERN in order to control the mechanical quality of the ATLAS muon chambers. We reached a measurement accuracy of 2 Î¼m systematic and 2 Î¼m statistical uncertainties in the horizontal and vertical directions in the working area 220 cm (horizontal)Ã60 cm (vertical). Here we describe in detail the fundamental approach of the basic principle chosen to achieve such good accuracy. In order to crosscheck our precision, key results of measurements are presented.

PREFACE: International Workshop on Discovery Physics at the LHC (Kruger2014) NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cleymans, Jean 2015-06-01 The third biannual conference on 'Discovery Physics at the LHC' was held on December 1-6 2014 at the Kruger Gate Hotel in South Africa. Over 100 participants attended from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. The latest results from the Large Hadron Collider as well the latest theoretical insights were presented. With the majestic Kruger National Park in the background this led to a very stimulating conference with many exchanges taking place. The proceedings reflect the high level of the conference. The financial contributions from the SA-CERN programme, the UCT-CERN Research Centre, the University of Johannesburg, the University of the Witwatersrand and iThemba L.A.B.S. are gratefully acknowledged.

Yacoob The SHIP facility at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) De Lellis, Giovanni 2016-04-01 Searches for new physics with accelerators are being performed at the LHC, looking for high massive particles coupled to matter with ordinary strength. A new experimental facility meant to search for very weakly coupled particles in the few GeV mass domain has been recently proposed. The existence of such particles, foreseen in different theoretical models beyond the Standard Model, is largely unexplored from the experimental point of view. A beam dump facility, built at CERN in the north area, using 400 GeV protons is a copious factory of charmed hadrons and could be used to probe the existence of such particles. The beam dump is also an ideal source of tau neutrinos, the less known particle in the Standard Model. In particular, tau anti-neutrinos have not been directly observed so far. We report the physics potential of such an experiment and outline the performances of a detector operating at the same facility for the search for the Ï â Î¼Î¼Î¼ decay. Pc as Physics Computer for Lhc ? NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Jarp, Sverre; Simmins, Antony; Tang, Hong; Yaari, R. In the last five years, we have seen RISC workstations take over the computing scene that was once controlled by mainframes and supercomputers. In this paper we will argue that the same phenomenon might happen again. A project, active since March this year in the Physics Data Processing group, of CERN's CN division is described where ordinary desktop PCs running Windows (NT and 3.11) have been used for creating an environment for running large LHC batch jobs (initially the DICE simulation job of Atlas). The problems encountered in porting both the CERN library and the specific Atlas codes are described together with some encouraging benchmark results when comparing to existing RISC workstations in use by the Atlas collaboration. The issues of establishing the batch environment (Batch monitor, staging software, etc.) are also covered. Finally a quick extrapolation of commodity computing power available in the future is touched upon to indicate what kind of cost envelope could be sufficient for the simulation farms required by the LHC experiments. High Energy Physics Research with the CMS Experiment at CERN DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Hanson, Gail G. 2013-05-31 The highlight of our last budget period, June 1, 2010, to May 31, 2013, was the discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), announced on July 4, 2012, and for which FranÃ§ois Englert and Peter Higgs were awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics on October 8, 2013. The Higgs boson was postulated in 1964 to explain how elementary particles obtain mass and was the missing piece of the Standard Model. However, the Standard Model does not describe everything that we know. There are many unanswered questions, such asmoreÂ Â» how can the Higgs boson have the mass that we have observed, are there more Higgs bosons, why is there more matter than antimatter, and what is the invisible dark matter, which constitutes about 85% of the matter in the universe. Our group played a significant role in the discovery of the Higgs boson and in subsequent analyses. We also carried out searches for new physics, in ways that could help elucidate some of the remaining questions. Our role in the CMS detector focused on the Tracker, a silicon strip outer tracker and pixel inner tracker.Â«Â less Footprints of Fascination: Digital Traces of Public Engagement with Particle Physics on CERN's Social Media Platforms. PubMed Kahle, Kate; Sharon, Aviv J; Baram-Tsabari, Ayelet 2016-01-01 Although the scientific community increasingly recognizes that its communication with the public may shape civic engagement with science, few studies have characterized how this communication occurs online. Social media plays a growing role in this engagement, yet it is not known if or how different platforms support different types of engagement. This study sets out to explore how users engage with science communication items on different platforms of social media, and what are the characteristics of the items that tend to attract large numbers of user interactions. Here, user interactions with almost identical items on five of CERN's social media platforms were quantitatively compared over an eight-week period, including likes, comments, shares, click-throughs, and time spent on CERN's site. The most popular items were qualitatively analyzed for content features. Findings indicate that as audience size of a social media platform grows, the total rate of engagement with content tends to grow as well. However, per user, engagement tends to decline with audience size. Across all platforms, similar topics tend to consistently receive high engagement. In particular, awe-inspiring imagery tends to frequently attract high engagement across platforms, independent of newsworthiness. To our knowledge, this study provides the first cross-platform characterization of public engagement with science on social media. Findings, although focused on particle physics, have a multidisciplinary nature; they may serve to benchmark social media analytics for assessing science communication activities in various domains. Evidence-based suggestions for practitioners are also offered.

First experimental evidence of hydrodynamic tunneling of ultraârelativistic protons in extended solid copper target at the CERN HiRadMat facility DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Schmidt, R.; Grenier, D.; Wollmann, D. 2014-08-15 A novel experiment has been performed at the CERN HiRadMat test facility to study the impact of the 440âGeV proton beam generated by the Super Proton Synchrotron on extended solid copper cylindrical targets. Substantial hydrodynamic tunneling of the protons in the target material has been observed that leads to significant lengthening of the projectile range, which confirms our previous theoretical predictions [N. A. Tahir et al., Phys. Rev. Spec. Top.-Accel. Beams 15, 051003 (2012)]. Simulation results show very good agreement with the experimental measurements. These results have very important implications on the machine protection design for powerful machines like themoreÂ Â» Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the future High Luminosity LHC, and the proposed huge 80âkm circumference Future Circular Collider, which is currently being discussed at CERN. Another very interesting outcome of this work is that one may also study the field of High Energy Density Physics at this test facility.Â«Â less Novel approaches for inspiring students and electrifying the public NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) LidstrÃ¶m, Suzy; Read, Alex; Parke, Stephen; Allen, Roland; Goldfarb, Steven; Mehlhase, Sascha; EkelÃ¶f, Tord; Walker, Alan 2014-03-01 We will briefly summarize a wide variety of innovative approaches for inspiring students and stimulating broad public interest in fundamental physics research, as exemplified by recent activities related to the Higgs boson discovery and Higgs-Englert Nobel Prize on behalf of the Swedish Academy, CERN, Fermilab, and the Niels Bohr Institute. Personal interactions with the scientists themselves can be particularly electrifying, and these were encouraged by the wearing of ``Higgs Boson? Ask Me!'' badges, which will be made available to those attending this talk. At CERN, activities include Virtual Visits, (Google) Hangout with CERN, initiatives to grab attention (LEGO models, music videos, art programs, pins, etc.), substantive communication (lab visits and events, museum exhibits, traveling exhibits, local visits, Masterclasses, etc.), and educational activities (summer student programs, semester abroad programs, internships, graduate programs, etc.). For serious students and their teachers, or scientists in other areas, tutorial articles are appropriate. These are most effective if they also incorporate innovative approaches - for example, attractive figures that immediately illustrate the concepts, analogies that will resonate with the reader, and a broadening of perspective.

Opto-mechanical design of vacuum laser resonator for the OSQAR experiment NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) HoÅ¡ek, Jan; MacÃºchovÃ¡, Karolina; NemcovÃ¡, Å Ã¡rka; Kunc, Å tÄpÃ¡n.; Å ulc, Miroslav 2015-01-01 This paper gives short overview of laser-based experiment OSQAR at CERN which is focused on search of axions and axion-like particles. The OSQAR experiment uses two experimental methods for axion search - measurement of the ultra-fine vacuum magnetic birefringence and a method based on the \"Light shining through the wall\" experiment. Because both experimental methods have reached its attainable limits of sensitivity we have focused on designing a vacuum laser resonator. The resonator will increase the number of convertible photons and their endurance time within the magnetic field. This paper presents an opto-mechanical design of a two component transportable vacuum laser resonator. Developed optical resonator mechanical design allows to be used as a 0.8 meter long prototype laser resonator for laboratory testing and after transportation and replacement of the mirrors it can be mounted on the LHC magnet in CERN to form a 20 meter long vacuum laser resonator. U.S. Involvement in the LHC DOE PAGES Green, Dan 2016-12-14 The demise of the SSC in the U.S. created an upheaval in the U.S. high energy physics (HEP) community.

The Hoopla Over the Higgs Boson: A Window into the State of Science Journalism NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cho, Adrian 2012-10-01 On July 4, experimenters at the European particle physics laboratory, CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland, held a special seminar in which they reported that they had at last discovered something resembling the Higgs boson, the last missing piece in particle physicists' standard model. The event drew more than 100 journalists, including myself, and the days leading up to the seminar evolved in almost a caricature of a media circus. Rumors coursed across the internet, bloggers prognosticated about what would be reported, anonymous sources whispered confidence levels to eager reporters, and on the very eve of the seminar CERN's own press office inadvertently leaked a video explaining many of the details. At a post-seminar press conference, dozens of photographers and videographers swarmed Peter Higgs, the eponymous theorist from the University of Edinburgh. Higgs even had his own handler to help him fend off the press onslaught. It was all great fun, but for a traditional journalist the event highlighted the many open questions we journalists now face. In the age of blogs and Twitter, does anybody really care that journalists try to put together fair, balanced, and accessible accounts of events? Or are people just as happy to get their information directly from researchers through their blogs or the lab through its press office? Is being first out with the story the only measure of success these days, or is there still a market for deeper analysis? I'll use the Higgs hoopla as a lens to lay out the questions as I see them. I am hoping to get the answers of the members of the audience in a discussion. The beam and detector of the NA62 experiment at CERN DOE PAGES Gil, E. Cortina; AlbarrÃ¡n, E.

INSPIRE will maintain the content and functionality of SPIRES plus many new features.

P.; Variola, A.; Yamazaki, Y.; Zurlo, N.; Athena Collaboration 2007-08-01 The ATHENA experiment at CERN, after producing cold antihydrogen atoms for the first time in 2002, has synthesised protonium atoms in vacuum at very low energies. Protonium, i.e. the antiproton-proton bound system, is of interest for testing fundamental physical theories. In the nested penning trap of the ATHENA apparatus protonium has been produced as result of a chemical reaction between an antiproton and the simplest matter molecule, H2+. The formed protonium atoms have kinetic energies in the range 40-700 meV and are metastable with mean lifetimes of the order of 1 Î¼s. Our result shows that it will be possible to start measurements on protonium at low energy antiproton facilities, such as the AD at CERN or FLAIR at GSI.

Big-Bang-Gate Cosmic Titanic: Why Aren't Physics Journal's Editors Bringing It To The Center of Scientific Attention NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Gentry, Robert 2010-02-01 Until now science's greatest debacle occurred when Copernicus exposed Ptolemaic cosmologists' 1300 hundred year-long fraud that it must be true because observations fit theory so well, while they ignored the untested state of its central assumption of Earth centered planetary motion. With much hubris modern physicists are confident this could never happen again, that the integrity of physics journals editors suffices to guarantee that a challenge to the reigning cosmological theory -- big bang cosmology -- would immediately be brought to the center of scientific attention for analysis and discussion. In fact a decade ago it was reported [MPLA 2619 (1997); arXiv:gr-gc/9806061] that, like Ptolemaic cosmology before it, big bang's central assumption that GR expansion effects cause in-flight expansion had never been tested and, further, that experimental testing of it using GR operation of the GPS showed it to be false. This result proves it is impossible for the 2.73 K CBR to be fireball relic radiation. These results were expanded in CERN reports EXT-2003-021;022, but have been uniformly rejected by physics journals, one of which accepted a paper similar to CERN EXT-2003-022, only to reject it a few days later with the admission not to publish it because of fearing reaction of the worldwide physics community. For update on my PRL submission see http://www.alphacosmos.net. ) Characterization of the Outer Barrel modules for the upgrade of the ALICE Inner Tracking System NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Di Ruzza, B. 2017-09-01 ALICE is one of the four large detectors at the CERN LHC collider, designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter, and in particular the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma using proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions. Despite the success already reached in achieving these physics goals, there are several measurements still to be finalized, like high precision measurements of rare probes (D mesons, Lambda baryons and B mesons decays) over a broad range of transverse momenta. In order to achieve these new physics goals, a wide upgrade plan was approved that combined with a significant increase of luminosity will enhance the ALICE physics capabilities enormously and will allow the achievement of these fundamental measurements. The Inner Tracking System (ITS) upgrade of the ALICE detector is one of the major improvements of the experimental set-up that will take place in 2019-2020 when the whole ITS sub-detector will be replaced with one realized using a innovative monolithic active pixel silicon sensor, called ALPIDE. The upgraded ITS will be realized using more than twenty-four thousand ALPIDE chips organized in seven different cylindrical layers, for a total surface of about ten square meters. The main features of the new ITS are a low material budget, high granularity and low power consumption. All these peculiar capabilities will allow for full reconstruction of rare heavy flavour decays and the achievement of the physics goals. In this paper after an overview of the whole ITS upgrade project, the construction procedure of the basic building block of the detector, namely the module, and its characterization in laboratory will be presented. Supersymmetry and Kaon physics NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Yamamoto, Kei 2017-01-01 Kaon physics has played an essential role in testing the Standard Model and in searching for new physics with measurements of CP violation and rare decays. Current progress of lattice calculations enables us to predict kaon observables accurately, especially for the direct CP violation, Îµâ§/Îµ, and there is a discrepancy from the experimental data at the 2.9 Ï level. On the experimental side, the rare kaon decays and are ongoing to be measured at the SM accuracy by KOTO at J-PARC and NA62 at CERN. These kaon observables are good probes for new physics. We study supersymmetric effects; the chargino and gluino contributions to Z penguin, in kaon observables. Unveiling the top secrets with the Large Hadron Collider NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Chierici, R. 2013-12-01 Top quark physics is one of the pillars of fundamental research in the field of high energy physics. It not only gives access to precision measurements for constraining the Standard Model of particles and interactions but also it represents a privileged domain for new physics searches. This contribution summarizes the main results in top quark physics obtained with the two general-purpose detectors ATLAS and CMS during the first two years of operations of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It covers the 2010 and 2011 data taking periods, where the LHC ran at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Top-quark pairs at high invariant mass: a model-independent discriminator of new physics at the Large Hadron Collider. PubMed Barger, Vernon; Han, Tao; Walker, Devin G E 2008-01-25 We study top-quark pair production to probe new physics at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We propose reconstruction methods for tt[over] semileptonic events and use them to reconstruct the tt[over] invariant mass. The angular distribution of top quarks in their c.m. frame can determine the spin and production subprocess for each new physics resonance. Forward-backward asymmetry and CP-odd variables can be constructed to further delineate the nature of new physics. We parametrize the new resonances with a few generic parameters and show high invariant mass top pair production may provide an early indicator for new physics beyond the standard model.

Black Holes and the Large Hadron Collider ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Roy, Arunava 2011-01-01 The European Center for Nuclear Research or CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has caught our attention partly due to the film \"Angels and Demons.\" In the movie, an antimatter bomb attack on the Vatican is foiled by the protagonist. Perhaps just as controversial is the formation of mini black holes (BHs).

Nevertheless, there are still fundamental phenomena, like the existence of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, which deserve an explanation that could come from the discovery of new particles. Searches for new physics with accelerators are performed at the LHC, looking for high massive particles coupled to matter with ordinary strength. A new experiment at CERN meant to search for very weakly coupled particles in the few GeV mass domain has been recently proposed. The existence of such particles, foreseen in different theoretical models beyond the Standard Model, is largely unexplored. A beam dump facility using high intensity 400 GeV protons is a copious source of such unknown particles in the GeV mass range. The beam dump is also a copious source of neutrinos and in particular it is an ideal source of tau neutrinos, the less known particle in the Standard Model. Indeed, tau anti-neutrinos have not been directly observed so far. We report the physics potential of such an experiment.

Top Quark and Higgs Boson Physics at LHC-ATLAS NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Tomoto, M. 2013-03-01 One of the main goal of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments at CERN in Switzerland is to aim to solve the \"origin of the mass\" by discovering the Higgs boson and understanding the interaction of the Higgs boson with the elementary particles. The ATLAS, which is one of the LHC experiments has taken about 5 fb-1 of physics quality data and published several results with regard to the \"origin of the mass\" since March 2010. This presentation focuses on the latest results of the heaviest elementary particle, namely, top quark physics and the Higgs boson searches from ATLAS. Elementary Particle Physics Experiment at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Brau, Benjamin; Dallapiccola, Carlo; Willocq, Stephane 2013-07-30 In this progress report we summarize the activities of the University of Massachusetts- Amherst group for the three years of this research project. We are fully engaged in research at the energy frontier with the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We have made leading contributions in software development and performance studies for the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, as well as on physics analysis with an emphasis on Standard Model measurements and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. In addition, we have increased our contributions to the Muon Spectrometer New Small Wheel upgrade project. Probing New Physics with Jets at the LHC ScienceCinema Harris, Robert 2017-12-09 The Large Hadron Collider at CERN has the potential to make a major discovery as early as 2008 from simple measurements of events with two high energy jets. This talk will present the jet trigger and analysis plans of the CMS collaboration, which were produced at the LHC Physics Center at Fermilab. Plans to search the two jet channel for generic signals of new particles and forces will be discussed. I will present the anticipated sensitivity of the CMS experiment to a variety of models of new physics, including quark compositeness, technicolor, superstrings, extra dimensions and grand unification.

RFQ2A and RFQ2B are 200 mA, 750 keV proton accelerators, operating at 202.56 MHz. Since the beginning of 1993, RFQ2B serves as injector to the CERN 50 MeV Alvarez linac (Linac 2). In 1992, both RFQs were on the test stand to undergo a series of beam measurements, which were compared with computations.

P.; Silari, M. 2016-01-01 The use of conventional Bonner Sphere Spectrometers (BSS) in pulsed neutron fields (PNF) is limited by the fact that proportional counters, usually employed as the thermal neutron detectors, suffer from dead time losses and show severe underestimation of the neutron interaction rate, which leads to strong distortion of the calculated spectrum. In order to avoid these limitations, an innovative BSS, called BSS-LUPIN, has been developed for measuring in PNF. This paper describes the physical characteristics of the device and its working principle, together with the results of Monte Carlo simulations of its response matrix. The BSS-LUPIN has been tested in the stray neutron field at the CERN Proton Synchrotron, by comparing the spectra obtained with the new device, the conventional CERN BSS and via Monte Carlo simulations.

Proof-of-principle demonstration of a virtual flow meter-based transducer for gaseous helium monitoring in particle accelerator cryogenics DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Arpaia, P.; Technology Department, European Organization for Nuclear Research; Blanco, E. 2015-07-15 A transducer based on a virtual flow meter is proposed for monitoring helium distribution and consumption in cryogenic systems for particle accelerators. The virtual flow meter allows technical and economical constraints, preventing installation of physical instruments in all the needed measurement points, to be overcome. Virtual flow meter performance for the alternative models of Samson [ http://www.samson.de (2015)] and Sereg-Schlumberger [ http://www.slb.com/ (2015)] is compared with the standard IEC 60534-2-1 [Industrial-process control valvesâPart 2-1: Flow capacityâsizing equations for fluid flow under installed conditions (2011), https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/2461], for a large temperature range, for both gaseous and liquid helium phases, and for differentmoreÂ Â» pressure drops. Then, the calibration function of the transducer is derived. Finally, the experimental validation for the helium gaseous state on the test station for superconducting magnets in the laboratory SM18 [Pirotte et al., AIP Conf. Proc. 1573, 187 (2014)] at CERN is reported.Â«Â less ATLAS DBM Module Qualification DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Soha, Aria; Gorisek, Andrej; Zavrtanik, Marko 2014-06-18 This is a technical scope of work (TSW) between the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) and the experimenters of Jozef Stefan Institute, CERN, and University of Toronto who have committed to participate in beam tests to be carried out during the 2014 Fermilab Test Beam Facility program. Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) diamond has a number of properties that make it attractive for high energy physics detector applications. Its large band-gap (5.5 eV) and large displacement energy (42 eV/atom) make it a material that is inherently radiation tolerant with very low leakage currents and high thermal conductivity. CVD diamond is beingmoreÂ Â» investigated by the RD42 Collaboration for use very close to LHC interaction regions, where the most extreme radiation conditions are found. This document builds on that work and proposes a highly spatially segmented diamond-based luminosity monitor to complement the time-segmented ATLAS Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) so that, when Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators (MTBS) and LUCID (LUminosity measurement using a Cherenkov Integrating Detector) have difficulty functioning, the ATLAS luminosity measurement is not compromised.Â«Â less LINEAR COLLIDER PHYSICS RESOURCE BOOK FOR SNOWMASS 2001.

The American particle physics community can look forward to a well-conceived and vital program of experimentation for the next ten years, using both colliders and fixed target beams to study a wide variety of pressing questions. Beyond 2010, these programs will be reaching the end of their expected lives. The CERN LHC will provide an experimental program of the first importance.

The workshop series, which began in 1990 in Lyon, France, brings together computer science researchers and practitioners, and researchers from particle physics and related fields in order to explore and confront the boundaries of computing and of automatic data analysis and theoretical calculation techniques. It is a forum for the exchange of ideas among the fields, exploring and promoting cutting-edge computing, data analysis and theoretical calculation techniques in fundamental physics research. This year's edition of the workshop brought together over 100 participants from all over the world. 14 invited speakers presented key topics on computing ecosystems, cloud computing, multivariate data analysis, symbolic and automatic theoretical calculations as well as computing and data analysis challenges in astrophysics, bioinformatics and musicology. Over 80 other talks and posters presented state-of-the art developments in the areas of the workshop's three tracks: Computing Technologies, Data Analysis Algorithms and Tools, and Computational Techniques in Theoretical Physics. Panel and round table discussions on data management and multivariate data analysis uncovered new ideas and collaboration opportunities in the respective areas. This edition of ACAT was generously sponsored by the Science and Technology Facility Council (STFC), the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP) at Durham University, Brookhaven National Laboratory in the USA and Dell. We would like to thank all the participants of the workshop for the high level of their scientific contributions and for the enthusiastic participation in all its activities which were, ultimately, the key factors in the success of the workshop.

Simon van der Meer (1925-2011):. A Modest Genius of Accelerator Science NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Chohan, Vinod C. 2011-02-01 Simon van der Meer was a brilliant scientist and a true giant of accelerator science. His seminal contributions to accelerator science have been essential to this day in our quest for satisfying the demands of modern particle physics. Whether we talk of long base-line neutrino physics or antiproton-proton physics at Fermilab or proton-proton physics at LHC, his techniques and inventions have been a vital part of the modern day successes. Simon van der Meer and Carlo Rubbia were the first CERN scientists to become Nobel laureates in Physics, in 1984. Van der Meer's lesserknown contributions spanned a whole range of subjects in accelerator science, from magnet design to power supply design, beam measurements, slow beam extraction, sophisticated programs and controls.

In our initial cohort of 109 men treated with curative radiotherapy for prostate cancer, daily image guidance computed tomography (CT) scans have been used to calculate delivered dose to the rectum, as distinct from planned dose, using an automated approach. Clinical toxicity data have been collected, allowing us to address the hypothesis that delivered dose provides a better predictor of toxicity than planned dose.

Higgs Boson 2016 DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Lincoln, Don The Higgs boson burst into the public arena on July 4, 2012, when scientists working at the CERN laboratory announced the particleâs discovery. However the initial discovery was a bit tentative, with the need to verify that the discovered particle was, indeed, the Higgs boson. In this video, Fermilabâs Dr. Don Lincoln looks at the data from the perspective of 2016 and shows that more recent analyses further supports the idea that the Higgs boson is what was discovered. Monitoring tools of COMPASS experiment at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Bodlak, M.; Frolov, V.; Huber, S.; Jary, V.; Konorov, I.; Levit, D.; Novy, J.; Salac, R.; Tomsa, J.; Virius, M. 2015-12-01 This paper briefly introduces the data acquisition system of the COMPASS experiment and is mainly focused on the part that is responsible for the monitoring of the nodes in the whole newly developed data acquisition system of this experiment. The COMPASS is a high energy particle experiment with a fixed target located at the SPS of the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The hardware of the data acquisition system has been upgraded to use FPGA cards that are responsible for data multiplexing and event building. The software counterpart of the system includes several processes deployed in heterogenous network environment. There are two processes, namely Message Logger and Message Browser, taking care of monitoring. These tools handle messages generated by nodes in the system. While Message Logger collects and saves messages to the database, the Message Browser serves as a graphical interface over the database containing these messages. For better performance, certain database optimizations have been used. Lastly, results of performance tests are presented. Preliminary Results of 3D-DDTC Pixel Detectors for the ATLAS Upgrade DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) La Rosa, Alessandro; /CERN; Boscardin, M. 2012-04-04 3D Silicon sensors fabricated at FBK-irst with the Double-side Double Type Column (DDTC) approach and columnar electrodes only partially etched through p-type substrates were tested in laboratory and in a 1.35 Tesla magnetic field with a 180 GeV pion beam at CERN SPS. The substrate thickness of the sensors is about 200 {mu}m, and different column depths are available, with overlaps between junction columns (etched from the front side) and ohmic columns (etched from the back side) in the range from 110 {mu}m to 150 {mu}m. The devices under test were bump bonded to the ATLAS Pixel readout chip (FEI3)moreÂ Â» at SELEX SI (Rome, Italy).

For example, in solid copper and solid carbon, these protons and the shower can penetrate up to 35 m and 25 m, respectively. However, their corresponding static range in the two materials is 1 m and 3 m, respectively. This will have important implications on machine protection design. In order to validate these simulation results, experiments have been performed at the CERN HiRadMat facility using the 440 GeV SPS proton beam irradiating solid copper cylindrical target. The phenomenon of hydrodynamic tunneling has been experimentally confirmed and good agreement has been found between the simulations and the experimental results. A very interesting outcome of this work is that the HiRadMat facility can be used to generate High Energy Density matter including Warm Dense Matter and strongly coupled plasmas in the laboratory. PREFACE Preface NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Bleicher, Markus; Caines, Helen; Calderon de la Barca Sanchez, Manuel; de Falco, Alessandro; Fries, Rainer; Granier de Cassagnac, Raphael; Hippolyte, Boris; Mischke, Andre; Nardi, Marzia; Salgado, Carlos A. 2011-01-01 The 4th Workshop for Young Scientists on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-nucleus Collisions (Hot Quarks 2010) was held in La Londe-Les-Maures, France, from June 21-26, 2010. Following the traditions of the conference, this meeting gathered more than 70 participants in the first years of their scientific careers. The present issue contains the proceedings of this workshop. The articles published in this volume clearly show the presence of a dynamic new generation of physicists interested in the different aspects of high energy nuclear collisions. The newest results from RHIC at Brookhaven and SPS at CERN were presented, as well as the latest results from the proton-proton programme from the LHC at CERN, while waiting for the data of the lead-lead collisions only available some months after the meeting. Along with these experimental findings, the corresponding theoretical research was also extensively discussed as well as the new perspectives for future facilities like FAIR, EIC and LHeC.

S. 2016-10-01 The completion of Run 1 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has seen the discovery of the Higgs boson and an unprecedented number of precise measurements of the Standard Model, and Run 2 has begun to provide the first data at higher energy. The high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) and the four experiments (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, and LHCb) will exploit the full potential of the collider to discover and explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. We review the experimental challenges and the physics opportunities in proton-proton collisions at the HL-LHC. Geant4 hadronic physics validation with ATLAS Tile Calorimeter test-beam data DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Alexa, C.; Constantinescu, S.; Dita, S. We present comparison studies between Geant4 shower packages and ATLAS Tile Calorimeter test-beam data collected at CERN in H8 beam line at the SPS. Emphasis is put on hadronic physics lists and data concerning differences between Tilecal response to pions and protons of same energy. The ratio between the pure hadronic fraction of pion and the pure hadronic fraction of proton F{sub h}{sup {pi}}/F{sub h}{sup p} was estimated with Tilecal test-beam data and compared with Geant4 simulations. PREFACE: Quark Matter 2006 Conference NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ma, Yu-Gang; Wang, En-Ke; Cai, Xu; Huang, Huan-Zhong; Wang, Xin-Nian; Zhu, Zhi-Yuan 2007-07-01 The Quark Matter 2006 conference was held on 14 20 November 2006 at the Shanghai Science Hall of the Shanghai Association of Sciences and Technology in Shanghai, China. It was the 19th International Conference on Ultra-Relativistic Nucleus Nucleus Collisions. The conference was organized jointly by SINAP (Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)) and CCNU (Central China Normal University, Wuhan). Over 600 scientists from 32 countries in five continents attended the conference. This is the first time that China has hosted such a premier conference in the field of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, an important event for the Chinese high energy nuclear physics community. About one half of the conference participants are junior scientistsâa clear indication of the vigor and momentum for this field, in search of the fundamental nature of the nuclear matter at extreme conditions. Professor T D Lee, honorary chair of the conference and one of the founders of the quark matter research, delivered an opening address with his profound and philosophical remarks on the recent discovery of the nature of strongly-interacting quark-gluon-plasma (sQGP). Professor Hongjie Xu, director of SINAP, gave a welcome address to all participants on behalf of the two hosting institutions. Dr Peiwen Ji, deputy director of the Mathematics and Physics Division of the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), also addressed the conference participants and congratulated them on the opening of the conference. Professor Mianheng Jiang, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), gave a concise introduction about the CAS as the premier research institution in China. He highlighted continued efforts at CAS to foster international collaborations between China and other nations. The Quark Matter 2006 conference is an example of such a successful collaboration between high energy nuclear physicists in China and other nations all over the world. The scientific program of the conference began with an overview of high energy nuclear physics in China by Professor Wenqing Shen, vice president of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Professor Shen highlighted many contributions made by the Chinese scientists in both theory and experiment. Dr Nick Samios, former director of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), gave a vivid account of the early years of RHIC and recent accomplishments. Highlights of the conference include new results from RHIC at BNL and SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). Many experimental results reported at the conference support the notion that the quark-gluon matter at RHIC behaves like a perfect liquid with minimum viscosity to entropy ratio. There were 15 plenary sessions which covered 54 plenary talks, 12 parallel sessions and 1 poster session. A total of 320 abstracts were submitted to the conference out of which 124 were selected for oral presentation and the rest were assigned to the poster session. Talks and posters in the conference covered a broad range of experimental and theoretical progress in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, which includes new evidence of sQGP, jet quenching and heavy quark energy loss, heavy-ion collision phenomenology, quantum field theory at finite temperature and/or density, and relevant areas of astrophysics and plasma physics. The Quark Matter 2006 conference coincided with the 80th birthday of Professor T D Lee. A special reception was held in the banquet hall of the Shanghai Grand Theatre to celebrate Professor Lee's birthday and to honor his great contributions to physics, in particular, to the development of high energy nuclear physics research in China. We would like to thank the members of the International Advisory Committee for providing valuable advice on a variety of matters, from the general structure of the conference to the selection of the plenary speakers and selection of abstracts for oral presentations. Professors T Hemmick, H Satz, D T Son and N Xu gave excellent pedagogical lectures in the pre-conference student symposium and their efforts were greatly appreciated. The Shanghai Association of Science and Technology (SAST) and the staff of the Shanghai science hall provided valuable assistance and services during the conference. The conference would not have run so smoothly without their professional dedication. We also thank Professor Wenqing Shen, Chairman of the SAST, for his many valuable suggestions to the conference organizers and for providing close cooperation with SAST staff. We thank members of the Local Organizing Committee for many useful suggestions and help. We would like to express our special appreciation for the tireless efforts by many local staff who worked very hard to make this conference a success. Dr Xiang-Zhou Cai, Mrs Wei Zhou and Mrs Yang Shen undertook many duties to coordinate and organize the local services. Dr Kun Wang took responsibility of the conference web page. Dr Wei Guo, Dr Wendong Tian, Mr Chunwang Ma and Mrs Wanyan Qian organized student volunteers for the conference. Without their help and dedication this conference could not have been such a success. The Quark Matter 2006 conference has received substantial financial support from many organizations, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the Ministry of Education of China (MOE), Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (SSTC), Chinese Nuclear Physics Society (CNPS), Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP), Central China Normal University (CCNU), China Center of Advanced Science and Technology (CCAST), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), and Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics (IOP Publishing). Higher moments of net-proton multiplicity distributions in a heavy-ion event pile-up scenario NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Garg, P.; Mishra, D. K. 2017-10-01 High-luminosity modern accelerators, like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), inherently have event pile-up scenarios which significantly contribute to physics events as a background. While state-of-the-art tracking algorithms and detector concepts take care of these event pile-up scenarios, several offline analytical techniques are used to remove such events from the physics analysis. It is still difficult to identify the remaining pile-up events in an event sample for physics analysis. Since the fraction of these events is significantly small, it may not be as serious of an issue for other analyses as it would be for an event-by-event analysis. Particularly when the characteristics of the multiplicity distribution are observable, one needs to be very careful. In the present work, we demonstrate how a small fraction of residual pile-up events can change the moments and their ratios of an event-by-event net-proton multiplicity distribution, which are sensitive to the dynamical fluctuations due to the QCD critical point. For this study, we assume that the individual event-by-event proton and antiproton multiplicity distributions follow Poisson, negative binomial, or binomial distributions. We observe a significant effect in cumulants and their ratios of net-proton multiplicity distributions due to pile-up events, particularly at lower energies. It might be crucial to estimate the fraction of pile-up events in the data sample while interpreting the experimental observable for the critical point. The Machine at the End of the Universe ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Monastersky, Richard 2008-01-01 Switzerland is the land of Big Ideas, where even the streets have Nobel prizes. At the European particle physics lab known as CERN, the roads through campus bear the names of Einstein, Curie, Bohr, and Heisenberg. Working amid those tributes to giants of the past century, physicists from around the world are trying to make history of their own andâ¦ The SHiP project at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) De Lellis, G.; SHiP Collaboration 2016-07-01 The discovery of the Higgs boson has fully confirmed the Standard Model of particles and fields. Nevertheless, there are still fundamental phenomena, like the existence of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry, which deserve an explanation that could come from the discovery of new particles. Searches for new physics with accelerators are performed at the LHC, looking for high massive particles coupled to matter with ordinary strength. A new experimental facility at CERN meant to search for very weakly coupled particles in the few GeV mass domain has been recently proposed. The existence of such particles, foreseen in different theoretical models beyond the Standard Model, is largely unexplored. A beam dump facility using 400 GeV protons is a copious factory of charmed hadrons and could be used to probe the existence of such particles. The beam dump is also a copious source of neutrinos and in particular it is an ideal source of tau neutrinos, the less known particle in the Standard Model. Indeed, tau anti-neutrinos have not been directly observed so far. We report the physics potential of such an experiment. Resistive Plate Chambers could play a role in the SHiP detector. Higgs Boson 2016 ScienceCinema Lincoln, Don 2018-06-12 The Higgs boson burst into the public arena on July 4, 2012, when scientists working at the CERN laboratory announced the particleÃ¢ÂÂs discovery. However the initial discovery was a bit tentative, with the need to verify that the discovered particle was, indeed, the Higgs boson. In this video, FermilabÃ¢ÂÂs Dr. Don Lincoln looks at the data from the perspective of 2016 and shows that more recent analyses further supports the idea that the Higgs boson is what was discovered. The discovery of the appearance of Î½Î¼ - Î½Ï oscillations NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ereditato, Antonio 2016-07-01 Almost 20 years after the first conceptual design of the experiment, five years of running in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory (LNGS), and billions of billions muon-neutrinos sent from CERN along the CNGS beam, in 2015 the OPERA neutrino detector has allowed the long-awaited discovery of the direct transformation (oscillation) of muon-neutrinos into tau-neutrinos. This result unambiguously confirms the interpretation of the so-called atmospheric channel, after the discovery of neutrino oscillations by the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration in 1998. Full steam ahead NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Heuer, Rolf-Dieter 2008-03-01 When the Economist recently reported the news of Rolf-Dieter Heuer's appointment as the next directorgeneral of CERN, it depicted him sitting cross-legged in the middle of a circular track steering a model train around him - smiling. It was an apt cartoon for someone who is about to take charge of the world's most powerful particle accelerator: the 27 km-circumference Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is nearing completion at the European laboratory just outside Geneva. What the cartoonist did not known is that model railways are one of Heuer's passions. Introduction NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) 2016-11-01 A year has passed since Raymond left us, but for many of us it seems like it was yesterday. Indeed, since his departure last July, not a week or even a day has gone by without his former collaborators, students, colleagues having a thought for him. Some initiatives have already been taken in order to celebrate Raymond's memory. The special day for Raymond organized at CERN last December was an opportunity to celebrate this exceptional man. In Annecy, with the implication of CERN and Marseille and thanks to a spontaneous and generous gift of Raymond's wife Marie-FranÃ§oise and their children Olivier and Thierry, the opening of a special room containing a huge collection of scientific books of Raymond is almost completed. It is in the same spirit that the present editors decided to dedicate a special issue of Nuclear Physics in memory of Raymond. In the following pages, some important problems Raymond was interested in are presented, discussed and sometimes solved. The diversity of topics in this issue reflects well the extent of Raymond's interests in Physics and Mathematics. Raymond was not only a gifted man for the so-called theoretical sciences, mathematics and physics, but he was also passionate about arts, music, drawing and of course literature, just as he was a leader always ready to bring his help and share his deep knowledge in physics and mathematics with others. Many people were deeply touched by Paul Sorba's tribute during Raymond's funeral. This is why we asked Paul to translate his speech, originally given in French, which seemed to us a perfect Prolegomena for this special volume of Nuclear Physics. The volume \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field Theory\" is organized as follows: General and historical contributions Charged pion spectra in protonâcarbon interactions at 31 GeV/c NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zofia PosiadaÅa, Magdalena; NA61/SHINE Collaboration 2013-02-01 The NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN SPS measured charged pion spectra in p+C interactions at 31 GeV/c. These measurements are necessary to improve predictions of the neutrino flux for the T2K long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in Japan. Presented analysis was based on the data collected during the first NA61/SHINE run in 2007 with an isotropic graphite target with a thickness of 4% of nuclear interaction length. Three different methods which were used in order to obtain Ï+ and Ï- spectra are introduced. Differential cross sections for negatively and positively charged pions are presented as a function of laboratory momentum in ten intervals of the laboratory polar angle up to 420 mrad. « 13 14 15 16 17 » « 14 15 16 17 18 » Section Editors NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Groep, D.

V.; Pankov, A. A.; Serenkova, I. A.; Bednyakov, V. A. 2017-12-01 Many new physics models predict production of heavy resonances in Drell-Yan channel and can be observed at the CERN LHC. If a new resonance is discovered as a peak in the dilepton invariant mass distribution at the LHC, the identification of its spin and couplings can be done by measuring production rates and angular distributions of the decay products. Here we discuss the spin-1 identification of Zâ§-boson for a set of representative models (SSM, E6, LR, and ALR) against the spin-2 RS graviton resonance and a spin-0 sneutrino resonance with the same mass and producing the same number of events under the resonance peak. We use the center-edge asymmetry for spin identification, as well as the total dilepton production cross section for the distinguishing the considered Zâ§-boson models from one another. The Cortex project A quasi-real-time information system to build control systems for high energy physics experiments NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Barillere, R.; Cabel, H.; Chan, B.; Goulas, I.; Le Goff, J. M.; Vinot, L.; Willmott, C.; Milcent, H.; Huuskonen, P. 1994-12-01 The Cortex control information system framework is being developed at CERN. It offers basic functions to allow the sharing of information, control and analysis functions; it presents a uniform human interface for such information and functions; it permits upgrades and additions without code modification and it is sufficiently generic to allow its use by most of the existing or future control systems at CERN. Services will include standard interfaces to user-supplied functions, analysis, archive and event management. Cortex does not attempt to carry out the direct data acquisition or control of the devices; these are activities which are highly specific to the application and are best done by commercial systems or user-written programs. Instead, Cortex integrates these application-specific pieces and supports them by supplying other commonly needed facilities such as collaboration, analysis, diagnosis and user assistance.

C.; Votano, L.; Williams, M. C. S.; Zani, S.; Zichichi, A.; Zuyeuski, R. 2017-02-01 The EEE (Extreme Energy Events) Project is an experiment for the detection of cosmic ray muons by means of a sparse array of telescopes, each made of three Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC), distributed over all the Italian territory and at CERN. The main scientific goals of the Project are the investigation of the properties of the local muon flux, the detection of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) and the search for long-distance correlations between far telescopes. The Project is also characterized by a strong educational and outreach aspect since the telescopes are managed by teams of students and teachers who had previously constructed them at CERN. In this paper an overall description of the experiment is given, including the design, construction and performance of the telescopes. The operation of the whole array, which currently consists of more than 50 telescopes, is also presented by showing the most recent physics results. First results from a combined analysis of CERN computing infrastructure metrics NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Duellmann, Dirk; Nieke, Christian 2017-10-01 The IT Analysis Working Group (AWG) has been formed at CERN across individual computing units and the experiments to attempt a cross cutting analysis of computing infrastructure and application metrics. In this presentation we will describe the first results obtained using medium/long term data (1 months â 1 year) correlating box level metrics, job level metrics from LSF and HTCondor, IO metrics from the physics analysis disk pools (EOS) and networking and application level metrics from the experiment dashboards. We will cover in particular the measurement of hardware performance and prediction of job duration, the latency sensitivity of different job types and a search for bottlenecks with the production job mix in the current infrastructure. The presentation will conclude with the proposal of a small set of metrics to simplify drawing conclusions also in the more constrained environment of public cloud deployments. Preliminary design of CERN Future Circular Collider tunnel: first evaluation of the radiation environment in critical areas for electronics NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Infantino, Angelo; AlÃ­a, RubÃ©n GarcÃ­a; Besana, Maria Ilaria; Brugger, Markus; Cerutti, Francesco 2017-09-01 As part of its post-LHC high energy physics program, CERN is conducting a study for a new proton-proton collider, called Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh), running at center-of-mass energies of up to 100 TeV in a new 100 km tunnel. The study includes a 90-350 GeV lepton collider (FCC-ee) as well as a lepton-hadron option (FCC-he). In this work, FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation was extensively used to perform a first evaluation of the radiation environment in critical areas for electronics in the FCC-hh tunnel. The model of the tunnel was created based on the original civil engineering studies already performed and further integrated in the existing FLUKA models of the beam line. The radiation levels in critical areas, such as the racks for electronics and cables, power converters, service areas, local tunnel extensions was evaluated. ENLIGHT: European network for Light ion hadron therapy. PubMed Dosanjh, Manjit; Amaldi, Ugo; Mayer, Ramona; Poetter, Richard 2018-04-03 The European Network for Light Ion Hadron Therapy (ENLIGHT) was established in 2002 following various European particle therapy network initiatives during the 1980s and 1990s (e.g. EORTC task group, EULIMA/PIMMS accelerator design). ENLIGHT started its work on major topics related to hadron therapy (HT), such as patient selection, clinical trials, technology, radiobiology, imaging and health economics. It was initiated through CERN and ESTRO and dealt with various disciplines such as (medical) physics and engineering, radiation biology and radiation oncology. ENLIGHT was funded until 2005 through the EC FP5 programme. A regular annual meeting structure was started in 2002 and continues until today bringing together the various disciplines and projects and institutions in the field of HT at different European places for regular exchange of information on best practices and research and development. Starting in 2006 ENLIGHT coordination was continued through CERN in collaboration with ESTRO and other partners involved in HT. Major projects within the EC FP7 programme (2008-2014) were launched for R&D and transnational access (ULICE, ENVISION) and education and training networks (Marie Curie ITNs: PARTNER, ENTERVISION). These projects were instrumental for the strengthening of the field of hadron therapy. With the start of 4 European carbon ion and proton centres and the upcoming numerous European proton therapy centres, the future scope of ENLIGHT will focus on strengthening current and developing European particle therapy research, multidisciplinary education and training and general R&D in technology and biology with annual meetings and a continuously strong CERN support. Collaboration with the European Particle Therapy Network (EPTN) and other similar networks will be pursued. Copyright Â© 2018 CERN. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Duringâ¦ Virtual reality visualization algorithms for the ALICE high energy physics experiment on the LHC at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Myrcha, Julian; TrzciÅski, Tomasz; Rokita, PrzemysÅaw 2017-08-01 Analyzing massive amounts of data gathered during many high energy physics experiments, including but not limited to the LHC ALICE detector experiment, requires efficient and intuitive methods of visualisation. One of the possible approaches to that problem is stereoscopic 3D data visualisation. In this paper, we propose several methods that provide high quality data visualisation and we explain how those methods can be applied in virtual reality headsets. The outcome of this work is easily applicable to many real-life applications needed in high energy physics and can be seen as a first step towards using fully immersive virtual reality technologies within the frames of the ALICE experiment. Development of high efficiency Versatile Arc Discharge Ion Source at CERN ISOLDE. PubMed Penescu, L; Catherall, R; Lettry, J; Stora, T 2010-02-01 We report here recent developments of Forced Electron Beam Induced Arc Discharge (FEBIAD) ion sources at the ISOLDE radioactive ion beam facility, hosted at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). As a result of the propositions to improve the ionization efficiency, two FEBIAD prototypes have been produced and successfully tested in 2008. Off-line studies showed that the 1+ ionization efficiencies for noble gases are 5-20 times larger than with the standard ISOLDE FEBIAD ion sources and reach 60% for radon, which allowed the identification at ISOLDE of (229)Rn, an isotope that had never previously been observed in the laboratory. A factor of 3 increase is also expected for the ionization efficiency of the other elements. The experimental and theoretical methodology is presented. The theoretical model, which gives precise insights on the processes affecting the ionization, is used to design optimal sources (grouped under the name of VADIS--Versatile Arc Discharge Ion Source) for the different chemical classes of the produced isotopes, as already demonstrated for the noble gases.

Physics in ;Real Life;: Accelerator-based Research with Undergraduates NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Klay, J. L. All undergraduates in physics and astronomy should have access to significant research experiences. When given the opportunity to tackle challenging open-ended problems outside the classroom, students build their problem-solving skills in ways that better prepare them for the workplace or future research in graduate school. Accelerator-based research on fundamental nuclear and particle physics can provide a myriad of opportunities for undergraduate involvement in hardware and software development as well as ;big data; analysis. The collaborative nature of large experiments exposes students to scientists of every culture and helps them begin to build their professional network even before they graduate. This paper presents an overview of my experiences - the good, the bad, and the ugly - engaging undergraduates in particle and nuclear physics research at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center.

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Banks, Michael 2008-09-01 For 63-year-old Sergio Ferrara, winning a multi-million-Euro grant from the European Research Council (ERC) will mean something special: being able to return to Italy to continue his research into high-energy physics. Without his European windfall, Ferrara, who currently works in the theory section at the CERN particle-physics lab near Geneva, would either have had to retire in a few years' time due to strict employment laws or emigrate to the US where there is no compulsory retirement age. So the news that he was among the first people to be awarded one of the ERC's generous new advanced grants came as a huge relief. The MoEDAL Experiment at the Lhc â a New Light on the High Energy Frontier NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Pinfold, James L. 2014-01-01 In 2010, the CERN (European Centre for Particle Physics Research) Research Board unanimously approved MoEDAL, the seventh international experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is designed to search for avatars of new physics signified by highly ionizing particles. A MoEDAL discovery would have revolutionary implications for our understanding of the microcosm, providing insights into such fundamental questions as: do magnetic monopoles exist, are there extra dimensions or new symmetries of nature; what is the mechanism for the generation of mass; what is the nature of dark matter and how did the big bang unfurl at the earliest times.

Update on CERN Search based on SharePoint 2013 NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Alvarez, E.; Fernandez, S.; Lossent, A.; Posada, I.; Silva, B.; Wagner, A. 2017-10-01 CERNâs enterprise Search solution âCERN Searchâ provides a central search solution for users and CERN service providers. A total of about 20 million public and protected documents from a wide range of document collections is indexed, including Indico, TWiki, Drupal, SharePoint, JACOW, E-group archives, EDMS, and CERN Web pages. In spring 2015, CERN Search was migrated to a new infrastructure based on SharePoint 2013. In the context of this upgrade, the document pre-processing and indexing process was redesigned and generalised. The new data feeding framework allows to profit from new functionality and it facilitates the long term maintenance of the system. Embedded fiber Bragg grating sensors for true temperature monitoring in Nb3Sn superconducting magnets for high energy physics NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Chiuchiolo, A.; Bajas, H.; Bajko, M.; Consales, M.; Giordano, M.; Perez, J. C.; Cusano, A. 2016-05-01 The luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) planned at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) requires the development of a new generation of superconducting magnets based on Nb3Sn technology. The instrumentation required for the racetrack coils needs the development of reliable sensing systems able to monitor the magnet thermo-mechanical behavior during its service life, from the coil fabrication to the magnet operation. With this purpose, Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors have been embedded in the coils of the Short Model Coil (SMC) magnet fabricated at CERN. The FBG sensitivity to both temperature and strain required the development of a solution able to separate mechanical and temperature effects. This work presents for the first time a feasibility study devoted to the implementation of an embedded FBG sensor for the measurement of the \"true\" temperature in the impregnated Nb3Sn coil during the fabrication process. Using S3 cloud storage with ROOT and CvmFS NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Arsuaga-RÃ­os, MarÃ­a; HeikkilÃ¤, Seppo S.; Duellmann, Dirk; Meusel, RenÃ©; Blomer, Jakob; Couturier, Ben 2015-12-01 Amazon S3 is a widely adopted web API for scalable cloud storage that could also fulfill storage requirements of the high-energy physics community. CERN has been evaluating this option using some key HEP applications such as ROOT and the CernVM filesystem (CvmFS) with S3 back-ends. In this contribution we present an evaluation of two versions of the Huawei UDS storage system stressed with a large number of clients executing HEP software applications. The performance of concurrently storing individual objects is presented alongside with more complex data access patterns as produced by the ROOT data analysis framework. Both Huawei UDS generations show a successful scalability by supporting multiple byte-range requests in contrast with Amazon S3 or Ceph which do not support these commonly used HEP operations. We further report the S3 integration with recent CvmFS versions and summarize the experience with CvmFS/S3 for publishing daily releases of the full LHCb experiment software stack. Analysis of the Laser Calibration System for the CMS HCAL at CERN's Large Hadron Collider NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Lebolo, Luis 2005-11-01 The European Organization for Nuclear Physics' (CERN) Large Hadron Collider uses the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector to measure collision products from proton-proton interactions. CMS uses a hadron calorimeter (HCAL) to measure the energy and position of quarks and gluons by reconstructing their hadronic decay products. An essential component of the detector is the calibration system, which was evaluated in terms of its misalignment, linearity, and resolution. In order to analyze the data, the authors created scripts in ROOT 5.02/00 and C++. The authors also used Mathematica 5.1 to perform complex mathematics and AutoCAD 2006 to produce optical ray traces. The misalignment of the optical components was found to be satisfactory; the Hybrid Photodiodes (HPDs) were confirmed to be linear; the constant, noise and stochastic contributions to its resolution were analyzed; and the quantum efficiency of most HPDs was determined to be approximately 40%. With a better understanding of the laser calibration system, one can further understand and improve the HCAL.

An electronic pulse processing circuit is associated with each individual sensing element and the response for ionizing particles is binary with an adjustable threshold. The noise rate for a threshold of 6000 e- has been measured to be less than 10-10. The inefficient area due to malfunctioning pixels is 2.8% of the 120 cm2. Detector overlaps within one plane have been used to determine the alignment of the components of the plane itself, without need for track reconstruction using external detectors. It is the first time that such a big surface covered with active pixels has been used in a physics experiment. Some aspects concerning inclined particle tracks and time walk have been measured separately in a beam test at the CERN SPS H6 beam. Radioactive ion beams at ISOLDE/CERN recent developments and perspectives DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Georg, U.; Catherall, R.; Giles, T. 1999-11-16 Since the move of ISOLDE from CERN's synchrocyclotron (SC) to the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) in 1992 extensive work has been devoted to the development of new beams, i.e. the production of new isotopes, beams of higher intensity and the ionization of further elements. Most of these developments were driven by the particular needs of the physics community proposing new experiments. The main achievements were the adaption of liquid metal targets to the pulsed proton beam to prevent shockwaves and splashing inside the target container and systematic studies on the time structure of the release of the isotopes from themoreÂ Â» target. Furthermore the work on laser ion-sources already started at ISOLDE-2 was continued, the so-called RIST target was developed, and most recently first tests on the isotope production while increasing the proton energy from 1 GeV to 1.4 GeV were done. The latter topics are discussed in this paper.Â«Â less Radioactive Ion Beams at ISOLDE/CERN Recent Developments and Perspectives DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) U.

Physics Laboratory is designed mainly aiming at learning the skill of basic experimental technique and technical writing. Although 95% students have taken physics in the senior high school, they poorly understand it by connecting with experience, and it is difficult to learn Physics Laboratory in the university. For this reason, we introduced two ICT (Information and Communication Technology) systems of Physics Laboratory to support students'learning and staff's teaching. By using quantitative data obtained from the ICT systems, we can easily check understanding of physics contents in students, and can improve physics education. A large hadron electron collider at CERN DOE PAGES Abelleira Fernandez, J. L. 2015-04-06 This document provides a brief overview of the recently published report on the design of the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), which comprises its physics programme, accelerator physics, technology and main detector concepts. The LHeC exploits and develops challenging, though principally existing, accelerator and detector technologies. This summary is complemented by brief illustrations of some of the highlights of the physics programme, which relies on a vastly extended kinematic range, luminosity and unprecedented precision in deep inelastic scattering. Illustrations are provided regarding high precision QCD, new physics (Higgs, SUSY) and eletron-ion physics. The LHeC is designed to run synchronously withmoreÂ Â» the LHC in the twenties and to achieve an integrated luminosity of O(100)fb â1. It will become the cleanest high resolution microscope of mankind and will substantially extend as well as complement the investigation of the physics of the TeV energy scale, which has been enabled by the LHC.Â«Â less Celebration in Honour of Magda and Torleif Ericson's 80th Birthday ScienceCinema Bernabeu, Jose; Chanfray, Guy; Wiese, Wolfram; Richter, Achim; Thomas, Anthony; Ericson, Magda; Ericson, Torleif 2018-06-21 A Chinese proverb says that happiness is when friends coming from far away meet and talk to each other. These words could very well be used to sum up the celebration held at CERN in honour of the 80th birthdays of Magda and Torleif Ericson, a couple both in the normal sense of the word and often also in the field of physics. During the celebratory event on 17 September, speakers reviewed the depth and breadth of the contributions that Torleif and Magda have made to theoretical physics in general and to nuclear physics in particular. JosÃÂ© Bernabeu, Guy Chanfray, Wolfram Wiese, Achim Richter and Anthony Thomas all covered the considerable research that has been stimulated by EricsonÃ¢ÂÂEricson correlation(s) over the past 50 years. ALICE in the early Universe wonderland NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Di Nezza, Pasquale 2012-03-01 In these years the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is probing, for the first time, physics at energy scales more than an order of magnitude beyond that of the Standard Model. These experiments explore an energy regime of particle physics where phenomena, such as supersymmetry and Grand Unified Theories, may become relevant. Certainly, the LHC should shed light on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and may discover the first fundamental scalar particle seen in nature. The collisions of heavy ions (Pb - Pb) will create the same \"soup\" the early Universe had at the epoch of 10-5 seconds. In general, there is a strong and growing interplay between particle physics and cosmology, in particular in the possible production of mini black holes and dark matter candidates like the lightest neutralino in the MSSM. 2016 FACET-II Science Workshop Summary Report DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Hogan, Mark J. The second in a series of FACET-II Science Workshops was held at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory on October 17-19, 2016 [1]. The workshop drew thirty-five participants from eighteen different institutions including CERN, DESY, Ecole Polytechnique, FNAL, JAI, LBNL, LLNL, Radiabeam, Radiasoft, SLAC, Stony Brook, Strathclyde, Tech-X, Tsinghua, UC Boulder, UCLA and UT Austin. The 2015 workshop [2, 3] helped prioritize research directions for FACET-II. The 2016 workshop was focused on understanding what improvements are needed at the facility to support the next generation of experiments. All presentations are linked to the workshop website as a permanent record. Race for the Higgs hots up as Tevatron seeks extension NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Banks, Michael 2009-12-01 With researchers at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) having circulated protons for the first time since last year's accident, the US Department of Energy (DOE) is requesting 25m so that the Tevatron collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois can run for an extra year until 2011. If the additional funding is granted, it would give physicists in the US an extra 12 months to close in on discovering the elusive Higgs boson. The DOE's request will now be reviewed before being part of President Barack Obama's 2011 budget request, which will be sent to Congress in February. Hangout with CERN: Reaching the Public with the Collaborative Tools of Social Media NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Goldfarb, S.; Kahle, K. L. M.; Rao, A. 2014-06-01 On 4 July 2012, particle physics became a celebrity. Around 1,000,000,000 people (yes, 1 billion) [1] saw rebroadcasts of two technical presentations announcing the discovery of a new boson. The occasion was a joint seminar of the CMS [2] and ATLAS [3] collaborations, and the target audience were particle physicists. Yet the world ate it up like a sporting event. Roughly two days later, in a parallel session of ICHEP in Melbourne, Australia [4], a group of physicists decided to explain the significance of this discovery to the public. They used a tool called \"Hangout\", part of the relatively new Google+ social media platform [5], to converse directly with the public via a webcast videoconference. The demand to join this Hangout [6] overloaded the server several times. In the end, a compromise involving Q&A via comments was set up, and the conversation was underway. We present a new project born shortly after this experience called Hangout with CERN [7], and discuss its success in creating an effective conversational channel between the public and particle physicists. We review earlier efforts by both CMS and ATLAS contributing to this development, and then describe the current programme, involving nearly all aspects of CERN, and some topics that go well beyond that. We conclude by discussing the potential of the programme both to improve our accountability to the public and to train our community for public communication. « 15 16 17 18 19 » « 16 17 18 19 20 » From Physics to industry: EOS outside HEP NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Espinal, X.; Lamanna, M. 2017-10-01 In the competitive market for large-scale storage solutions the current main disk storage system at CERN EOS has been showing its excellence in the multi-Petabyte high-concurrency regime. It has also shown a disruptive potential in powering the service in providing sync and share capabilities and in supporting innovative analysis environments along the storage of LHC data. EOS has also generated interest as generic storage solution ranging from university systems to very large installations for non-HEP applications.

Their aim is to show Europeans how today's society couldn't be without fundamental research . Could you imagine life without mobile phones, cars, CD players, TV, refrigerators, computers, the internet and the World Wide Web, antibiotics, vitamins, anaesthetics, vaccination, heating, pampers, nylon stockings, glue, bar codes, metal detectors, contact lenses, modems, laser printers, digital cameras, gameboys, play stations...? Technology is everywhere and used by everyone in today's society, but how many Europeans suspect that without studies on the structure of the atom, lasers would not exist, and neither would CD players? Most do not realise that most things they couldn't be without have required years of fundamental research . To fill this knowledge gap, the leading Research Organizations in Europe [1], with the support of the research directorate of the European Commission, have joined forces to inform Europeans how technology couldn't be without science, and how science can no longer progress without technology. The project is called...... Sci-Tech - Couldn't be without it! Sci-Tech - Couldn't be without it! invites Europeans to vote online in a survey to identify the top ten technologies they can't live without. It will show them through a dynamic and entertaining Web space where these top technologies really come from, and it will reveal their intimate links with research. Teaching kits will be developed to explain to students how their favourite gadgets actually work, and how a career in science can contribute to inventions that future generations couldn't be without. The results of the survey will be presented as a series of quiz shows live on the Internet during the Science Week, from 4 to 10 November. Sci-tech - Couldn't be without it! will be launched on Friday 22 March at 18:30 at the Technopolis Science Museum in Brussels , coinciding with the official inauguration of CERN's travelling exhibition \"E=mc 2 - When energy becomes matter\". The exhibition will stay at Technopolis until 21 July. CERN Director General, Luciano Maiani , and European Commissioner for Research, Philippe Busquin , will open the event with speeches underlining the importance of joining efforts for science education and outreach in Europe. A tour of the exhibition and a demonstration of the project's hot site for cool science will follow, and the event will be brought to a close with a \"Science in the Pub\" discussion on the subject of modern physics and philosophy, complete with musical intermezzo and buffet. * Access the Couldn't be without it! online voting and web resources at: www.cern.ch/sci-tech * Confirm your presence at the Technopolis event before Wed.

Physics and Diplomacy: A True Story NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Sessoms, Allen 2017-01-01 Physics has played a prominent role in U.S. diplomacy since the development of nuclear weapons during World War II. The discipline expanded its reach during the Atoms for Peace initiative of president Eisenhower and continued through the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Physics maintains a prominent role in the diplomatic dialogue through efforts in the nuclear non-proliferation arena and in major international science collaborations such as in experiments at CERN, ITER and the International Space Station. Physics has also served as the template for the much broader impact of science on diplomacy. For example, climate change, energy efficiency and ocean science have all benefitted from the path blazed by physicists. But how effective have physicists been in steering clear of political dynamics while trying to infuse scientific facts into policy debates? This talk will consider this through the eyes of a physicist who has spent many years providing advice to policy makers, both inside and outside of government. XXV International Workshop on Deep-Inelastic Scattering and Related Subjects NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) DIS2017 is the 25th in an annual series of international workshops covering an eclectic mixture of material related to Quantum Chromodynamics and Deep Inelastic Scattering as well as a general survey of the hottest current topics in high energy physics. Much of the program is devoted to the most recent results from large experiments at BNL, CERN, DESY, FNAL, JLab, and KEK. Relevant theoretical advances are also covered in detail. The meeting is organised around seven working groups: WG1) Structure Functions and Parton Densities; WG2) Low x and Diffractive Physics; WG3) Higgs and BSM Physics in Hadron Collisions; WG4) Hadronic and Electroweak Observables; WG5) Physics with Heavy Flavours; WG6) Spin and 3D Structure; WG7) Future of DIS.

Assessing student understanding of measurement and uncertainty NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Jirungnimitsakul, S.; Wattanakasiwich, P. 2017-09-01 The objectives of this study were to develop and assess student understanding of measurement and uncertainty. A test has been adapted and translated from the Laboratory Data Analysis Instrument (LDAI) test, consists of 25 questions focused on three topics including measures of central tendency, experimental errors and uncertainties, and fitting regression lines. The test was evaluated its content validity by three physics experts in teaching physics laboratory. In the pilot study, Thai LDAI was administered to 93 freshmen enrolled in a fundamental physics laboratory course. The final draft of the test was administered to three groupsâ45 freshmen taking fundamental physics laboratory, 16 sophomores taking intermediated physics laboratory and 21 juniors taking advanced physics laboratory at Chiang Mai University. As results, we found that the freshmen had difficulties in experimental errors and uncertainties. Most students had problems with fitting regression lines. These results will be used to improve teaching and learning physics laboratory for physics students in the department. EFQPSK Versus CERN: A Comparative Study NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Borah, Deva K.; Horan, Stephen 2001-01-01 This report presents a comparative study on Enhanced Feher's Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (EFQPSK) and Constrained Envelope Root Nyquist (CERN) techniques. These two techniques have been developed in recent times to provide high spectral and power efficiencies under nonlinear amplifier environment. The purpose of this study is to gain insights into these techniques and to help system planners and designers with an appropriate set of guidelines for using these techniques. The comparative study presented in this report relies on effective simulation models and procedures. Therefore, a significant part of this report is devoted to understanding the mathematical and simulation models of the techniques and their set-up procedures. In particular, mathematical models of EFQPSK and CERN, effects of the sampling rate in discrete time signal representation, and modeling of nonlinear amplifiers and predistorters have been considered in detail. The results of this study show that both EFQPSK and CERN signals provide spectrally efficient communications compared to filtered conventional linear modulation techniques when a nonlinear power amplifier is used. However, there are important differences. The spectral efficiency of CERN signals, with a small amount of input backoff, is significantly better than that of EFQPSK signals if the nonlinear amplifier is an ideal clipper. However, to achieve such spectral efficiencies with a practical nonlinear amplifier, CERN processing requires a predistorter which effectively translates the amplifier's characteristics close to those of an ideal clipper. Thus, the spectral performance of CERN signals strongly depends on the predistorter. EFQPSK signals, on the other hand, do not need such predistorters since their spectra are almost unaffected by the nonlinear amplifier, Ibis report discusses several receiver structures for EFQPSK signals. It is observed that optimal receiver structures can be realized for both coded and uncoded EFQPSK signals with not too much increase in computational complexity. When a nonlinear amplifier is used, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the CERN signals with a matched filter receiver is found to be more than one decibel (dB) worse compared to the bit error performance of EFQPSK signals. Although channel coding is found to provide BER performance improvement for both EFQPSK and CERN signals, the performance of EFQPSK signals remains better than that of CERN. Optimal receiver structures for CERN signals with nonlinear equalization is left as a possible future work. Based on the numerical results, it is concluded that, in nonlinear channels, CERN processing leads towards better bandwidth efficiency with a compromise in power efficiency. Hence for bandwidth efficient communications needs, CERN is a good solution provided effective adaptive predistorters can be realized. On the other hand, EFQPSK signals provide a good power efficient solution with a compromise in band width efficiency. A experimental research program on chirality at the LHC DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Markert, Christina Heavy-ion collisions provide a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental laws of physics of the strong force. The extreme conditions created by the collisions within a finite volume are akin to the properties of the deconfined partonic state which existed very shortly after the Big Bang and just prior to visible matter formation in the Universe. In this state massless quarks and gluons (partons) are ``quasi free\" particles, the so-called Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). By following the expansion and cooling of this state, we will map out the process of nucleonic matter formation, which occurs during the phase transition. ThemoreÂ Â» fundamental properties of this early partonic phase of matter are not well understood, but they are essential for confirming QCD (Quantum Chromo-Dynamics) and the Standard Model. The specific topic, chiral symmetry restoration, has been called ``the remaining puzzle of QCD.'' This puzzle can only be studied in the dense partonic medium generated in heavy-ion collisions. The research objectives of this proposal are the development and application of new analysis strategies to study chirality and the properties of the medium above the QGP phase transition using hadronic resonances detected with the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN research laboratory in Switzerland. This grant funded a new effort at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) to investigate the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) at the highest possible energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN via the ALICE experiment. The findings added to our knowledge of the dynamical evolution and the properties of the hot, dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions, and provided a deeper understanding of multi-hadron interactions in these extreme nuclear matter systems. Our group contributed as well to the hardware and software for the ALICE USA-funded Calorimeter Detector (EMCal). The LHC research program and its connection to fundamental questions in high energy, nuclear and astrophysics has triggered the imagination of many young students worldwide. The studies also promoted the early involvement of students and young postdocs in a large, multi-national research effort abroad, which provided them with substantial experience and skills prior to choosing their career path. The undergraduate program, in conjunction with the Freshman Research Initiative at UT Austin, allowed the students to complete a research project within the field of Nuclear Physics.Â«Â less Sharing scientific discovery globally: toward a CERN virtual visit service NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Goldfarb, S.; Hatzifotiadou, D.; Lapka, M.; Papanestis, A. 2017-10-01 The installation of virtual visit services by the LHC collaborations began shortly after the first high-energy collisions were provided by the CERN accelerator in 2010. The experiments: ATLAS [1], CMS [2], LHCb [3], and ALICE [4] have all joined in this popular and effective method to bring the excitement of scientific exploration and discovery into classrooms and other public venues around the world. Their programmes, which use a combination of video conference, webcast, and video recording to communicate with remote audiences have already reached tens of thousands of viewers, and the demand only continues to grow. Other venues, such as the CERN Control Centre, are also considering similar permanent installations. We present a summary of the development of the various systems in use around CERN today, including the technology deployed and a variety of use cases. We then lay down the arguments for the creation of a CERN-wide service that would support these programmes in a more coherent and effective manner. Potential services include a central booking system and operational management similar to what is currently provided for the common CERN video conference facilities. Certain choices in technology could be made to support programmes based on popular tools including (but not limited to) Skypeâ¢ [5], Google Hangouts [6], Facebook Live [7], and Periscope [8]. Successful implementation of the project, which relies on close partnership between the experiments, CERN IT CDA [9], and CERN IR ECO [10], has the potential to reach an even larger, global audience, more effectively than ever before.

Mysql Data-Base Applications for Dst-Like Physics Analysis NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Tsenov, Roumen 2004-07-01 The data and analysis model developed and being used in the HARP experiment for studying hadron production at CERN Proton Synchrotron is discussed. Emphasis is put on usage of data-base (DB) back-ends for persistent storing and retrieving \"alive\" C++ objects encapsulating raw and reconstructed data. Concepts of \"Data Summary Tape\" (DST) as a logical collection of DB-persistent data of different types, and of \"intermediate DST\" (iDST) as a physical \"tag\" of DST, are introduced. iDST level of persistency allows a powerful, DST-level of analysis to be performed by applications running on an isolated machine (even laptop) with no connection to the experiment's main data storage. Implementation of these concepts is considered. Learning with the ATLAS Experiment at CERN ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Barnett, R. M.; Johansson, K. E.; Kourkoumelis, C.; Long, L.; Pequenao, J.; Reimers, C.; Watkins, P. 2012-01-01 With the start of the LHC, the new particle collider at CERN, the ATLAS experiment is also providing high-energy particle collisions for educational purposes. Several education projects--education scenarios--have been developed and tested on students and teachers in several European countries within the Learning with ATLAS@CERN project. Theseâ¦ First experience with the new .cern Top Level Domain NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Alvarez, E.; Malo de Molina, M.; Salwerowicz, M.; Silva De Sousa, B.; Smith, T.; Wagner, A. 2017-10-01 In October 2015, CERNâs core website has been moved to a new address, http://home.cern, marking the launch of the brand new top-level domain .cern. In combination with a formal governance and registration policy, the IT infrastructure needed to be extended to accommodate the hosting of Web sites in this new top level domain. We will present the technical implementation in the framework of the CERN Web Services that allows to provide virtual hosting, a reverse proxy solution and that also includes the provisioning of SSL server certificates for secure communications. Black Holes and the Large Hadron Collider NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Roy, Arunava 2011-12-01 The European Center for Nuclear Research or CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has caught our attention partly due to the film ``Angels and Demons.'' In the movie, an antimatter bomb attack on the Vatican is foiled by the protagonist. Perhaps just as controversial is the formation of mini black holes (BHs). Recently, the American Physical Society1 website featured an article on BH formation at the LHC.2 This article examines some aspects of mini BHs and explores the possibility of their detection at the LHC. « 16 17 18 19 20 » « 17 18 19 20 21 » Workshop Ã¢ÂÂPhysics for Health in EuropeÃ¢ÂÂ ScienceCinema Battistoni, G. 2018-05-25 2nd part of the session. 2-4 February 2010 at CERN This event will be will be available live via the Webcast Service and transmitted in parallel to:IT auditorium,ÃÂ Salle Anderssen 40-S2-A01 (Tuesday 2nd February) BE auditorium (all day), Salle 40-S2-01 (only between 08:00- 14:00) (Wednesday 3rd February) BE auditorium, Salle Curie 40-S2-C01 (Thursday 4th February)ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ Fireworks on the 4th of July NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Barnett, R. Michael 2013-02-01 After half a century of waiting, the drama was intense. Physicists slept overnight outside the auditorium to get seats for the seminar at the CERN lab in Geneva, Switzerland. Ten thousand miles away on the other side of the planet, at the world's most prestigious international particle physics conference, hundreds of physicists from every corner of the globe lined up to hear the seminar streamed live from Geneva (see Fig. 1). And in universities from North America to Asia, physicists and students gathered to watch the streaming talks.

PubMed Tahir, N A; Burkart, F; Shutov, A; Schmidt, R; Wollmann, D; Piriz, A R 2014-12-01 In a recent publication [Schmidt et al., Phys. Plasmas 21, 080701 (2014)], we reported results on beam-target interaction experiments that have been carried out at the CERN HiRadMat (High Radiation to Materials) facility using extended solid copper cylindrical targets that were irradiated with a 440-GeV proton beam delivered by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). On the one hand, these experiments confirmed the existence of hydrodynamic tunneling of the protons that leads to substantial increase in the range of the protons and the corresponding hadron shower in the target, a phenomenon predicted by our previous theoretical investigations [Tahir et al., Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 25, 051003 (2012)]. On the other hand, these experiments demonstrated that the beam heated part of the target is severely damaged and is converted into different phases of high energy density (HED) matter, as suggested by our previous theoretical studies [Tahir et al., Phys. Rev. E 79, 046410 (2009)]. The latter confirms that the HiRadMat facility can be used to study HED physics. In the present paper, we give details of the numerical simulations carried out to understand the experimental measurements. These include the evolution of the physical parameters, for example, density, temperature, pressure, and the internal energy in the target, during and after the irradiation. This information is important in order to determine the region of the HED phase diagram that can be accessed in such experiments. These simulations have been done using the energy deposition code fluka and a two-dimensional hydrodynamic code, big2, iteratively. Celebration in Honour of Magda and Torleif Ericson's 80th Birthday DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Bernabeu, Jose; Chanfray, Guy; Wiese, Wolfram A Chinese proverb says that happiness is when friends coming from far away meet and talk to each other. These words could very well be used to sum up the celebration held at CERN in honour of the 80th birthdays of Magda and Torleif Ericson, a couple both in the normal sense of the word and often also in the field of physics. During the celebratory event on 17 September, speakers reviewed the depth and breadth of the contributions that Torleif and Magda have made to theoretical physics in general and to nuclear physics in particular.

ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Lunetta, Vincent N.; Tamir, Pinchas In evaluating whether the laboratory guides for Project Physics and for PSSC are consistent with the goals of their designers in demonstrating the interplay between experiment and theory in the development of physics, a system was developed for analyzing physics laboratory investigations, and the laboratory activities in the \"PSSC Physicsâ¦ Beyond the Large Hadron Collider: A First Look at Cryogenics for CERN Future Circular Colliders NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Lebrun, Philippe; Tavian, Laurent Following the first experimental discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the recent update of the European strategy in particle physics, CERN has undertaken an international study of possible future circular colliders beyond the LHC. The study, conducted with the collaborative participation of interested institutes world-wide, considers several options for very high energy hadron-hadron, electron-positron and hadron-electron colliders to be installed in a quasi-circular underground tunnel in the Geneva basin, with a circumference of 80 km to 100 km. All these machines would make intensive use of advanced superconducting devices, i.e. high-field bending and focusing magnets and/or accelerating RF cavities, thus requiring large helium cryogenic systems operating at 4.5 K or below. Based on preliminary sets of parameters and layouts for the particle colliders under study, we discuss the main challenges of their cryogenic systems and present first estimates of the cryogenic refrigeration capacities required, with emphasis on the qualitative and quantitative steps to be accomplished with respect to the present state-of-the-art. Transverse beam splitting made operational: Key features of the multiturn extraction at the CERN Proton Synchrotron NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Huschauer, A.; Blas, A.; Borburgh, J.; Damjanovic, S.; Gilardoni, S.; Giovannozzi, M.; Hourican, M.; Kahle, K.; Le Godec, G.; Michels, O.; Sterbini, G.; Hernalsteens, C. 2017-06-01 Following a successful commissioning period, the multiturn extraction (MTE) at the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) has been applied for the fixed-target physics programme at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) since September 2015. This exceptional extraction technique was proposed to replace the long-serving continuous transfer (CT) extraction, which has the drawback of inducing high activation in the ring. MTE exploits the principles of nonlinear beam dynamics to perform loss-free beam splitting in the horizontal phase space. Over multiple turns, the resulting beamlets are then transferred to the downstream accelerator. The operational deployment of MTE was rendered possible by the full understanding and mitigation of different hardware limitations and by redesigning the extraction trajectories and nonlinear optics, which was required due to the installation of a dummy septum to reduce the activation of the magnetic extraction septum. This paper focuses on these key features including the use of the transverse damper and the septum shadowing, which allowed a transition from the MTE study to a mature operational extraction scheme. One Year of FOS Measurements in CMS Experiment at CERN NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) SzillÃ¡si, ZoltÃ¡n; Buontempo, Salvatore; BÃ©ni, NoÃ©mi; Breglio, Giovanni; Cusano, Andrea; Laudati, Armando; Giordano, Michele; Saccomanno, Andrea; Druzhkin, Dmitry; Tsirou, Andromachi Results are presented on the activity carried out by our research group, in collaboration with the SME Optosmart s.r.l. (an Italian spin-off company), on the application of Fiber Optic Sensor (FOS) techniques to monitor high-energy physics (HEP) detectors. Assuming that Fiber Bragg Grating sensors (FBGs) radiation hardness has been deeply studied for other field of application, we have applied the FBG technology to the HEP research domain. We present here the experimental evidences of the solid possibility to use such a class of sensors also in HEP detector very complex environmental side conditions. In particular we present more than one year data results of FBG measurements in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment set up at the CERN, where we have monitored temperatures (within CMS core) and strains in different locations by using FBG sensors during the detector operation with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions and high magnetic field. FOS data and FOS readout system stability and reliability is demonstrated, with continuous 24/24 h 7/7d data taking under severe and complex side conditions. Accelerator controls at CERN: Some converging trends NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Kuiper, B. 1990-08-01 CERN's growing services to the high-energy physics community using frozen resources has led to the implementation of \"Technical Boards\", mandated to assist the management by making recommendations for rationalizations in various technological domains. The Board on Process Control and Electronics for Accelerators, TEBOCO, has emphasized four main lines which might yield economy in resources. First, a common architecture for accelerator controls has been agreed between the three accelerator divisions. Second, a common hardware/software kit has been defined, from which the large majority of future process interfacing may be composed. A support service for this kit is an essential part of the plan. Third, high-level protocols have been developed for standardizing access to process devices. They derive from agreed standard models of the devices and involve a standard control message. This should ease application development and mobility of equipment. Fourth, a common software engineering methodology and a commercial package of application development tools have been adopted. Some rationalization in the field of the man-machine interface and in matters of synchronization is also under way.

This unique event took place in November 2001 at CERN in Geneva, as part of the 2001 European Science and Technology Week, an initiative by the European Commission to raise the public awareness of science in Europe. The \"Life in the Universe\" programme comprised competitions in 23 European countries to identify the best projects from school students. The projects could be scientific or a piece of art, a theatrical performance, poetry or even a musical performance. The only restriction was that the final work must be based on scientific evidence. Winning teams from each country were invited to a \"Final Event\" at CERN on 8-11 November, 2001 to present their projects to a panel of International Experts during a special three-day event devoted to understanding the possibility of other life forms existing in our Universe. This Final Event also included a spectacular 90-min webcast from CERN with the highlights of the programme. The video describes the Final Event and the enthusiastic atmosphere when more than 200 young students and teachers from all over Europe met with some of the world's leading scientific experts of the field. The present video clip, with excerpts from the film, is available in four versions: two MPEG files and two streamer-versions of different sizes; the latter require RealPlayer software. Video Clip 01/02 may be freely reproduced. The 20-min video is available on request from ESO, for viewing in VHS and, for broadcasters, in Betacam-SP format. Please contact the ESO EPR Department for more details. Life in the Universe was jointly organised by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) , the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) , in co-operation with the European Association for Astronomy Education (EAAE). Other research organisations were associated with the programme, e.g., the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).

The light of SESAME: A dream becomes reality NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Schopper, H. 2017-04-01 The foundation of the international SESAME synchrotron laboratory in Jordan is described including political, technical, scientific and financial aspects. Following the model of CERN, its objective is not only to promote science but also bring people together from countries with different traditions, religions and mentalities. To create an international organisation in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region required sometimes quite unconventional procedures not disclosed in any official document. Because of the exceptional circumstances, a more detailed description of its history may be of interest. Although its success was doubted by many at its start, the facility will start operation in spring 2017. « 17 18 19 20 21 » « 18 19 20 21 22 » Challenges in 21st Century Physics NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Wilson, Thomas L. 2007-01-01 We are truly fortunate to live in one of the great epochs of human discovery, a time when science is providing new visions and understanding about ourselves and the world in which we live. At last, we are beginning to explore the Universe itself. One particularly exciting area of advancement is high-energy physics where several existing concepts will be put to the test. A brief survey will be given of accomplishments in 20th Century physics. These include relativity and quantum physics which have produced breakthroughs in cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. The current situation is then assessed, combining the last 100 years of progress with new 21st Century challenges about unification and where to go next. Finally, the future is upon us. The next frontier in experimental high-energy physics, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, is scheduled to begin coming online this year (2007). The potential for the LHC to address several of the significant problems in physics today will be discussed, as this great accelerator examines the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics and even cosmology. New physics and new science will surely emerge and a better vision of the world will unfold. M. Hildred Blewett and the Blewett Scholarship NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Whitten, Barbara 2011-03-01 M. Hildred Blewett became a physicist at a time when few women were physicists. After beginning her career at General Electric, she became a respected accelerator physicist, working at Brookhaven, Argonne, and eventually CERN. Blewett was married for a time to John Blewett, another accelerator physicist, but the couple divorced without children and she never remarried. She felt that her career in physics was hampered by her gender, and when she died in 2004 at the age of 93, she left the bulk of her estate to the American Physical Society, to found a Scholarship for women in physics. Since 2005 the Blewett Scholarship has been awarded to women in physics who are returning to physics after a career break, usually for family reasons. Family/career conflicts are one of the most important reasons why young women in early careers leave physics---a loss for them as well as the physics community, which has invested time and money in their training. The Blewett Scholarship is one way for the physics community, under the leadership of CSWP, to help these young women resume their careers. I will discuss the life and work of Hildred Blewett, the Blewett Scholarship, and its benefits to the physics community.

Specifically, experiments overcome the restriction that spacecraft measurements are made at only one (or a few) points in space, enable greater control of the plasma conditions and applied perturbations, can be reproducible, and are orders of magnitude less expensive than launching spacecraft. Here, I highlight key open questions about the physics of space plasmas and identify the aspects of these problems that can potentially be tackled in laboratory experiments. Several past successes in laboratory space physics provide concrete examples of how complementary experiments can contribute to our understanding of physical processes at play in the solar corona, solar wind, planetary magnetospheres, and the outer boundary of the heliosphere. I present developments on the horizon of laboratory space physics, identifying velocity space as a key new frontier, highlighting new and enhanced experimental facilities, and showcasing anticipated developments to produce improved diagnostics and innovative analysis methods. A strategy for future laboratory space physics investigations will be outlined, with explicit connections to specific fundamental plasma phenomena of interest. LCG MCDBâa knowledgebase of Monte-Carlo simulated events NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Belov, S.; Dudko, L.; Galkin, E.; Gusev, A.; Pokorski, W.; Sherstnev, A. 2008-02-01 In this paper we report on LCG Monte-Carlo Data Base (MCDB) and software which has been developed to operate MCDB. The main purpose of the LCG MCDB project is to provide a storage and documentation system for sophisticated event samples simulated for the LHC Collaborations by experts. In many cases, the modern Monte-Carlo simulation of physical processes requires expert knowledge in Monte-Carlo generators or significant amount of CPU time to produce the events. MCDB is a knowledgebase mainly dedicated to accumulate simulated events of this type. The main motivation behind LCG MCDB is to make the sophisticated MC event samples available for various physical groups. All the data from MCDB is accessible in several convenient ways. LCG MCDB is being developed within the CERN LCG Application Area Simulation project.

For example, the same MC samples of Standard Model (SM) processes can be employed for the investigations either in the SM analyses (as a signal) or in searches for new phenomena in Beyond Standard Model analyses (as a background). If the samples are made available publicly and equipped with corresponding and comprehensive documentation, it can speed up cross checks of the samples themselves and physical models applied. Some event samples require a lot of computing resources for preparation. So, a central storage of the samples prevents possible waste of researcher time and computing resources, which can be used to prepare the same events many times. Solution method: Creation of a special knowledgebase (MCDB) designed to keep event samples for the LHC experimental and phenomenological community. The knowledgebase is realized as a separate web-server ( http://mcdb.cern.ch). All event samples are kept on types at CERN. Documentation describing the events is the main contents of MCDB. Users can browse the knowledgebase, read and comment articles (documentation), and download event samples. Authors can upload new event samples, create new articles, and edit own articles. Restrictions: The software is adopted to solve the problems, described in the article and there are no any additional restrictions. Unusual features: The software provides a framework to store and document large files with flexible authentication and authorization system. Different external storages with large capacity can be used to keep the files. The WEB Content Management System provides all of the necessary interfaces for the authors of the files, end-users and administrators. Running time: Real time operations.

Nanoscale TiOâ-coated LPGs as radiation-tolerant humidity sensors for high-energy physics applications. PubMed Consales, Marco; Berruti, Gaia; Borriello, Anna; Giordano, Michele; Buontempo, Salvatore; Breglio, Giovanni; Makovec, Alajos; Petagna, Paolo; Cusano, Andrea 2014-07-15 This Letter deals with a feasibility analysis for the development of radiation-tolerant fiber-optic humidity sensors based on long-period grating (LPG) technology to be applied in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments currently running at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). In particular, here we propose a high-sensitivity LPG sensor coated with a finely tuned titanium dioxide (TiOâ) thin layer (~100 nm thick) through the solgel deposition method. Relative humidity (RH) monitoring in the range 0%-75% and at four different temperatures (in the range -10Â°C-25Â°C) was carried out to assess sensor performance in real operative conditions required in typical experiments running at CERN. Experimental results demonstrate the very high RH sensitivities of the proposed device (up to 1.4 nm/% RH in correspondence to very low humidity levels), which turned out to be from one to three orders of magnitude higher than those exhibited by fiber Bragg grating sensors coated with micrometer-thin polyimide overlays. The radiation tolerance capability of the TiOâ-coated LPG sensor is also investigated by comparing the sensing performance before and after its exposure to a 1 Mrad dose of Î³-ionizing radiation. Overall, the results collected demonstrate the strong potential of the proposed technology with regard to its future exploitation in HEP applications as a robust and valid alternative to the commercial (polymer-based) hygrometers currently used.

Beyond the standard model of particle physics. PubMed Virdee, T S 2016-08-28 The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and its experiments were conceived to tackle open questions in particle physics. The mechanism of the generation of mass of fundamental particles has been elucidated with the discovery of the Higgs boson. It is clear that the standard model is not the final theory. The open questions still awaiting clues or answers, from the LHC and other experiments, include: What is the composition of dark matter and of dark energy? Why is there more matter than anti-matter? Are there more space dimensions than the familiar three? What is the path to the unification of all the fundamental forces? This talk will discuss the status of, and prospects for, the search for new particles, symmetries and forces in order to address the open questions.This article is part of the themed issue 'Unifying physics and technology in light of Maxwell's equations'.

Events are selected containing at least three jets with scalar sum of jet transverse momenta (H T) greater than 1 TeV. No excess is seen at large H T and limits are presented on new physics: models which produce final states containing at least three jets and having cross sections larger than 1.6 fb with H T > 5.8 TeV are excluded. As amoreÂ Â» result, limits are also given in terms of new physics models of strong gravity that hypothesize additional space-time dimensions.Â«Â less The MoEDAL Experiment at the LHC NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Pinfold, James L. 2014-04-01 In 2010 the CERN (European Centre for Particle Physics Research) Research Board unanimously approved MoEDAL, the 7th international experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is designed to search for avatars of new physics signified by highly ionizing particles. The MoEDAL detector is like a giant camera ready to reveal \"photographic\" evidence for new physics and also to actually trap long-lived new particles for further study. The MoEDAL experiment will significantly expand the horizon for discovery at the LHC, in a complementary way. A MoEDAL discovery would have revolutionary implications for our understanding of the microcosm, providing insights into such fundamental questions as: do magnetic monopoles exist, are there extra dimensions or new symmetries of nature; what is the mechanism for the generation of mass; what is the nature of dark matter and how did the big-bang unfurl at the earliest times. Using the FLUKA Monte Carlo Code to Simulate the Interactions of Ionizing Radiation with Matter to Assist and Aid Our Understanding of Ground Based Accelerator Testing, Space Hardware Design, and Secondary Space Radiation Environments NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Reddell, Brandon 2015-01-01 Designing hardware to operate in the space radiation environment is a very difficult and costly activity. Ground based particle accelerators can be used to test for exposure to the radiation environment, one species at a time, however, the actual space environment cannot be duplicated because of the range of energies and isotropic nature of space radiation. The FLUKA Monte Carlo code is an integrated physics package based at CERN that has been under development for the last 40+ years and includes the most up-to-date fundamental physics theory and particle physics data. This work presents an overview of FLUKA and how it has been used in conjunction with ground based radiation testing for NASA and improve our understanding of secondary particle environments resulting from the interaction of space radiation with matter.

K. In this paper, we present a strange stellar model using Tolman V-type metric potential employing simplest form of the MIT bag equation of state (EOS) for the quark matter. We consider that the stellar system is spherically symmetric, compact and made of an anisotropic fluid. Choosing different values of n we obtain exact solutions of the Einstein field equations and finally conclude that for a specific value of the parameter n = 1/2, we find physically acceptable features of the stellar object. Further, we conduct different physical tests, viz., the energy condition, generalized Tolman-Oppeheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, Herreraâs cracking concept, etc., to confirm the physical validity of the presented model. Matching conditions provide expressions for different constants whereas maximization of the anisotropy parameter provides bag constant. By using the observed data of several compact stars, we derive exact values of some of the physical parameters and exhibit their features in tabular form. It is to note that our predicted value of the bag constant satisfies the report of CERN-SPS and RHIC. Nuclear spectroscopy with Geant4. The superheavy challenge NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Sarmiento, Luis G. 2016-12-01 The simulation toolkit Geant4 was originally developed at CERN for high-energy physics. Over the years it has been established as a swiss army knife not only in particle physics but it has seen an accelerated expansion towards nuclear physics and more recently to medical imaging and Î³- and ion- therapy to mention but a handful of new applications. The validity of Geant4 is vast and large across many particles, ions, materials, and physical processes with typically various different models to choose from. Unfortunately, atomic nuclei with atomic number Z > 100 are not properly supported. This is likely due to the rather novelty of the field, its comparably small user base, and scarce evaluated experimental data. To circumvent this situation different workarounds have been used over the years. In this work the simulation toolkit Geant4 will be introduced with its different components and the effort to bring the software to the heavy and superheavy region will be described. RealTime Physics: Active learning laboratory NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Thornton, Ronald K.; Sokoloff, David R. 1997-03-01 Our research shows that student learning of physics concepts in introductory physics courses is enhanced by the use of special guided discovery laboratory curricula which embody the results of educational research and which are supported by the use of the Tools for Scientific Thinking microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) tools. In this paper we first describe the general characteristics of the research-based RealTime Physics laboratory curricula developed for use in introductory physics classes in colleges, universities and high schools. We then describe RealTime Physics Mechanics in detail. Finally we examine student learning of dynamics in traditional physics courses and in courses using RealTime Physics Mechanics, primarily by the use of correlated questions on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. We present considerable evidence that students who use the new laboratory curricula demonstrate significantly improved learning and retention of dynamics concepts compared to students taught by traditional methods. 25th Birthday Cern- Amphi ScienceCinema None 2017-12-09 CÃÂ©rÃÂ©monie du 25ÃÂ¨me anniversaire du Cern avec 2 orateurs: le Prof.Weisskopf parle de la signification et le rÃÂ´le du Cern et le Prof.Casimir(?) fait un exposÃÂ© sur les rÃÂ©lations entre la science pure et la science appliquÃÂ©e et la \"big science\" (science lÃÂ©gÃÂ¨re) « 18 19 20 21 22 » « 19 20 21 22 23 » Parallel Event Analysis Under Unix NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Looney, S.; Nilsson, B. S.; Oest, T.; Pettersson, T.; Ranjard, F.; Thibonnier, J.-P. The ALEPH experiment at LEP, the CERN CN division and Digital Equipment Corp. have, in a joint project, developed a parallel event analysis system. The parallel physics code is identical to ALEPH's standard analysis code, ALPHA, only the organisation of input/output is changed. The user may switch between sequential and parallel processing by simply changing one input \"card\". The initial implementation runs on an 8-node DEC 3000/400 farm, using the PVM software, and exhibits a near-perfect speed-up linearity, reducing the turn-around time by a factor of 8. GPU real-time processing in NA62 trigger system NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ammendola, R.; Biagioni, A.; Chiozzi, S.; Cretaro, P.; Di Lorenzo, S.; Fantechi, R.; Fiorini, M.; Frezza, O.; Lamanna, G.; Lo Cicero, F.; Lonardo, A.; Martinelli, M.; Neri, I.; Paolucci, P. S.; Pastorelli, E.; Piandani, R.; Piccini, M.; Pontisso, L.; Rossetti, D.; Simula, F.; Sozzi, M.; Vicini, P. 2017-01-01 A commercial Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is used to build a fast Level 0 (L0) trigger system tested parasitically with the TDAQ (Trigger and Data Acquisition systems) of the NA62 experiment at CERN. In particular, the parallel computing power of the GPU is exploited to perform real-time fitting in the Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detector. Direct GPU communication using a FPGA-based board has been used to reduce the data transmission latency. The performance of the system for multi-ring reconstrunction obtained during the NA62 physics run will be presented. AGIS: The ATLAS Grid Information System NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Anisenkov, Alexey; Belov, Sergey; Di Girolamo, Alessandro; Gayazov, Stavro; Klimentov, Alexei; Oleynik, Danila; Senchenko, Alexander 2012-12-01 ATLAS is a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The experiment produces petabytes of data annually through simulation production and tens petabytes of data per year from the detector itself. The ATLAS Computing model embraces the Grid paradigm and a high degree of decentralization and computing resources able to meet ATLAS requirements of petabytes scale data operations. In this paper we present ATLAS Grid Information System (AGIS) designed to integrate configuration and status information about resources, services and topology of whole ATLAS Grid needed by ATLAS Distributed Computing applications and services. AGIS: The ATLAS Grid Information System NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Anisenkov, A.; Di Girolamo, A.; Klimentov, A.; Oleynik, D.; Petrosyan, A.; Atlas Collaboration 2014-06-01 ATLAS, a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, produced petabytes of data annually through simulation production and tens of petabytes of data per year from the detector itself.

Liquid Argon Calorimetry for ATLAS NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Robinson, Alan 2008-05-01 This summer, the largest collaborative physics project since the Manhattan project will go online. One of four experiments for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, ATLAS, employs over 2000 people. Canadians have helped design, construct, and calibrate the liquid argon calorimeters for ATLAS to capture the products of the high energy collisions produced by the LHC. From an undergraduate's perspective, explore how these calorimeters are made to handle their harsh requirement. From nearly a billion proton-proton collisions a second, physicists hope to discover the Higgs boson and other new fundamental particles. Results from the HARP Experiment DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Catanesi, M. G. 2008-02-21 Hadron production is a key ingredient in many aspects of {nu} physics. Precise prediction of atmospheric {nu} fluxes, characterization of accelerator {nu} beams, quantification of {pi} production and capture for {nu}-factory designs, all of these would profit from hadron production measurements. HARP at the CERN PS was the first hadron production experiment designed on purpose to match all these requirements. It combines a large, full phase space acceptance with low systematic errors and high statistics. HARP was operated in the range from 3 GeV to 15 GeV. We briefly describe here the most recent results. Global EOS: exploring the 300-ms-latency region NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mascetti, L.; Jericho, D.; Hsu, C.-Y. 2017-10-01 EOS, the CERN open-source distributed disk storage system, provides the highperformance storage solution for HEP analysis and the back-end for various work-flows. Recently EOS became the back-end of CERNBox, the cloud synchronisation service for CERN users. EOS can be used to take advantage of wide-area distributed installations: for the last few years CERN EOS uses a common deployment across two computer centres (Geneva-Meyrin and Budapest-Wigner) about 1,000 km apart (â¼20-ms latency) with about 200 PB of disk (JBOD). In late 2015, the CERN-IT Storage group and AARNET (Australia) set-up a challenging R&D project: a single EOS instance between CERN and AARNET with more than 300ms latency (16,500 km apart). This paper will report about the success in deploy and run a distributed storage system between Europe (Geneva, Budapest), Australia (Melbourne) and later in Asia (ASGC Taipei), allowing different type of data placement and data access across these four sites. INTEGRATED OPERATIONAL DOSIMETRY SYSTEM AT CERN. PubMed Dumont, GÃ©rald; Pedrosa, Fernando Baltasar Dos Santos; Carbonez, Pierre; Forkel-Wirth, Doris; Ninin, Pierre; Fuentes, Eloy Reguero; Roesler, Stefan; Vollaire, Joachim 2017-04-01 CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, upgraded its operational dosimetry system in March 2013 to be prepared for the first Long Shutdown of CERN's facilities. The new system allows the immediate and automatic checking and recording of the dosimetry data before and after interventions in radiation areas. To facilitate the analysis of the data in context of CERN's approach to As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), this new system is interfaced to the Intervention Management Planning and Coordination Tool (IMPACT). IMPACT is a web-based application widely used in all CERN's accelerators and their associated technical infrastructures for the planning, the coordination and the approval of interventions (work permit principle). The coupling of the operational dosimetry database with the IMPACT repository allows a direct and almost immediate comparison of the actual dose with the estimations, in addition to enabling the configuration of alarm levels in the dosemeter in function of the intervention to be performed.

The mission of CERN; push back the frontiers of knowledge, e.g. the secrets of the Big Bang...what was the matter like within the first moments of the Universe's existence? You have to develop new technologies for accelerators and detectors (also information technology--the Web and the GRID and medicine--diagnosis and therapy). There are three key technology areas at CERN; accelerating, particle detection, large-scale computing. Non-physics peer demonstrators in undergraduate laboratories: a study of studentsâ perceptions NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Braun, Michael; Kirkup, Les 2016-01-01 Laboratory demonstrators play a crucial role in facilitating studentsâ learning in physics subjects. Inspired by the success of peer-led activities, we introduced peer demonstrators to support student learning in first-year physics subjects that enrol students not intending to major in physics. Surveys were administered to 1700 students over 4 years in four subjects to examine student perceptions of how demonstrators assisted them in the laboratory. Scores awarded to peer demonstrators by students were no lower than those awarded to demonstrators traditionally employed in the first year physics laboratory. These latter demonstrators were drawn mainly from the ranks of physics research students. The findings validate the recruitment of peer demonstrators and will be used to inform the recruitment and support programmes for laboratory demonstrators. Service management at CERN with Service-Now NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Toteva, Z.; Alvarez Alonso, R.; Alvarez Granda, E.; Cheimariou, M.-E.; Fedorko, I.; Hefferman, J.; Lemaitre, S.; Clavo, D. Martin; Martinez Pedreira, P.; Pera Mira, O. 2012-12-01 The Information Technology (IT) and the General Services (GS) departments at CERN have decided to combine their extensive experience in support for IT and non-IT services towards a common goal - to bring the services closer to the end user based on Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practice. The collaborative efforts have so far produced definitions for the incident and the request fulfilment processes which are based on a unique two-dimensional service catalogue that combines both the user and the support team views of all services. After an extensive evaluation of the available industrial solutions, Service-now was selected as the tool to implement the CERN Service-Management processes. The initial release of the tool provided an attractive web portal for the users and successfully implemented two basic ITIL processes; the incident management and the request fulfilment processes. It also integrated with the CERN personnel databases and the LHC GRID ticketing system. Subsequent releases continued to integrate with other third-party tools like the facility management systems of CERN as well as to implement new processes such as change management. Independently from those new development activities it was decided to simplify the request fulfilment process in order to achieve easier acceptance by the CERN user community. We believe that due to the high modularity of the Service-now tool, the parallel design of ITIL processes e.g., event management and non-ITIL processes, e.g., computer centre hardware management, will be easily achieved. This presentation will describe the experience that we have acquired and the techniques that were followed to achieve the CERN customization of the Service-Now tool. Vidyo@CERN: A Service Update NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Fernandes, J.; Baron, T. 2015-12-01 We will present an overview of the current real-time video service offering for the LHC, in particular the operation of the CERN Vidyo service will be described in terms of consolidated performance and scale: The service is an increasingly critical part of the daily activity of the LHC collaborations, topping recently more than 50 million minutes of communication in one year, with peaks of up to 852 simultaneous connections. We will elaborate on the improvement of some front-end key features such as the integration with CERN Indico, or the enhancements of the Unified Client and also on new ones, released or in the pipeline, such as a new WebRTC client and CERN SSO/Federated SSO integration. An overview of future infrastructure improvements, such as virtualization techniques of Vidyo routers and geo-location mechanisms for load-balancing and optimum user distribution across the service infrastructure will also be discussed. The work done by CERN to improve the monitoring of its Vidyo network will also be presented and demoed. As a last point, we will touch the roadmap and strategy established by CERN and Vidyo with a clear objective of optimizing the service both on the end client and backend infrastructure to make it truly universal, to serve Global Science. To achieve those actions, the introduction of the multitenant concept to serve different communities is needed. This is one of the consequences of CERN's decision to offer the Vidyo service currently operated for the LHC, to other Sciences, Institutions and Virtual Organizations beyond HEP that might express interest for it. Artium mater in relativistic astrophysics : New perspectives for a European-Latin American PhD program NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Chardonnet, Pascal 2015-12-01 Following the successful scientific space missions by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile, as well as the high-energy particle activities at CERN in Genve, we have created a Ph.D. program dedicated to the formation of scientists in the field of relativistic astrophysics. The students of such a program will lead the theoretical developments of one of the most active fields of research, based on the above observational and experimental facilities. This program needs expertise in the most advanced topics of mathematical and theoretical physics, and in relativistic field theories. It requires the ability to model the observational data received from the above facilities, as well as all the basic knowledge in astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology. This activity is necessarily international, no single university can cover the broad expertises. From this, the proposed program of the IRAP Ph.D., in one of the youngest and most dynamical French universities, pole of research and teaching in the Euro-Mediterranean region (PRES): the University of Nice. It benefits from the presence of the astrophysics research institute of Observatoire de la Cte d'Azur involved in relativistic and non-photonic astrophysics. The participation of the Freie Universitaet Berlin, Oldenburg and Bremen Universities and of the Einstein Institute in Potsdam offers the possibility of teaching in relativistic field theories at the highest level. The University of Savoy offers the link to the particle physics at CERN. The activities at the University of Rome, at Stockholm University and at ICRANet offer teaching programs in all the fields of relativistic astrophysics, including cosmology, the physics of gravitational collapse, gamma-ray bursts, and black hole physics. Finally, the University of Ferrara will be present with lectures and researches in the topics they have pioneered such as x-ray astrophysics and observational cosmology. Through ICRANet the extra-European connections with Brazil, China and India will be guaranteed: in China, with the Shanghai Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Science, studying the formation and evolution of large-scale structure and galaxies; in India, with the Indian Centre for Space Physics (ICSP), renowned for its research on compact objects as well as on solar physics and astrochemistry; in Brazil with ICRANet Brazil where a successful program of research and teaching in relativistic astrophysics has been established in recent years.

We look forward to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN to explore the 1-TeV scale (extending efforts at LEP and the Tevatron to unravel the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking) and many initiatives to develop our understanding of the problem of identity: what makes a neutrino a neutrino and a top quark a top quark. We suspect that the detection of proton decay is only a few orders of magnitude away in sensitivity. Astronomical observations should help to tell us what kinds of matter and energy make up the universe. We might even learn to read experiment for clues about the dimensionality of spacetime. If we are inventive enough, we may be able to follow this rich menu with the physics opportunities offered by a linear electron-positron collider and a (muon storage ring) neutrino factory. I expect a remarkable flowering of experimental particle physics, and of theoretical physics that engages with experiment.

Some tests, such as source code static analysis, are executed on a single dedicated service: in High Energy Physics, a full simulation and reconstruction chain on a distributed computing environment, backed with a sample âgoldenâ dataset, is also necessary for the quality sign off. The ALICE experiment uses dedicated and virtualized computing infrastructures for the Release Validation in order not to taint the production environment (i.e. CVMFS and the Grid) with non-validated software and validation jobs: the ALICE Release Validation cluster is a disposable virtual cluster appliance based on CernVM and the Virtual Analysis Facility, capable of deploying on demand, and with a single command, a dedicated virtual HTCondor cluster with an automatically scalable number of virtual workers on any cloud supporting the standard EC2 interface. Input and output data are externally stored on EOS, and a dedicated CVMFS service is used to provide the software to be validated. We will show how the Release Validation Cluster deployment and disposal are completely transparent for the Release Manager, who simply triggers the validation from the ALICE build system's web interface. CernVM 3, based entirely on CVMFS, permits to boot any snapshot of the operating system in time: we will show how this allows us to certify each ALICE software release for an exact CernVM snapshot, addressing the problem of Long Term Data Preservation by ensuring a consistent environment for software execution and data reprocessing in the future.

Ploc, Ondrej; Kubancak, Jan; Sihver, Lembit; Uchihori, Yukio; Jakubek, Jan; Ambrozova, Iva; Molokanov, Alexander; Pinsky, Lawrence 2014-01-01 Objective of our research was to explore capabilities of Timepix for its use as a single dosemeter and LET spectrometer in mixed radiation fields created by heavy ions. We exposed it to radiation field (i) at heavy ion beams at HIMAC, Chiba, Japan, (ii) in the CERN's high-energy reference field (CERF) facility at Geneva, France/Switzerland, (iii) in the exposure room of the proton therapy laboratory at JINR, Dubna, Russia, and (iv) onboard aircraft. We compared the absolute values of dosimetric quantities obtained with Timepix and with other dosemeters and spectrometers like tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) Hawk, silicon detector Liulin, and track-etched detectors (TEDs). « 19 20 21 22 23 » « 20 21 22 23 24 » LHC Inauguration and LHCFest ScienceCinema None 2018-06-26 The LHC official inauguration will take place from 14h00 to 18h00, at Point 18 of the Laboratory, in the presence of the highest representatives from the member states of CERN and representatives from the other communities and authorities of the countries participating in the LHC adventure. 300 members from the international press are also expected, giving a total of 1500 guests. The ceremony will be broadcast live in the LaboratoryÃ¢ÂÂs main conference rooms, via webcast and satellite TV (Eurovision). The LHC-fest will follow in the evening in the same place. Its purpose is to, \"thank all the actors Ã¢ÂÂ physicists, engineers, technicians and administrators Ã¢ÂÂ who took part in the design, construction, implementation and commissioning of this great enterprise.\" For obvious logistical reasons, it has been necessary to limit the number of invited guests to 3000, to include all members of personnel (blue badge holders), representatives of the LHC experiments and other users, as well as representatives from retired staff and industrial support. Public Lecture ScienceCinema None 2017-12-09 An outreach activity is being organized by the Turkish community at CERN, on 5 June 2010 at CERN Main Auditorium. The activity consists of several talks that will take 1.5h in total. The main goal of the activity will be describing the CERN based activities and experiments as well as stimulating the public's attention to the science related topics. We believe the wide communication of the event has certain advantages especially for the proceeding membership process of Turkey. On Defining Mass NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Hecht, Eugene 2011-01-01 Though central to any pedagogical development of physics, the concept of mass is still not well understood. Properly defining mass has proven to be far more daunting than contemporary textbooks would have us believe. And yet today the origin of mass is one of the most aggressively pursued areas of research in all of physics. Much of the excitement surrounding the Large Hadron Collider at CERN is associated with discovering the mechanism responsible for the masses of the elementary particles. This paper will first briefly examine the leading definitions, pointing out their shortcomings. Then, utilizing relativity theory, it will proposeâfor consideration by the community of physicistsâa conceptual definition of mass predicated on the more fundamental concept of energy, more fundamental in that everything that has mass has energy, yet not everything that has energy has mass. Search for new physics in the monophoton final state in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Sirunyan, Albert M; et al. 2017-06-12 A search is conducted for new physics in a final state containing a photon and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. The data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 inverse-femtobarns. No deviations are observed relative to the predictions of the standard model. The results are interpreted as exclusion limits on the dark matter production cross sections and parameters in models containing extra spatial dimensions. Improved limits are set with respect to previous searches using the monophoton final state. In particular, the limits on the extramoreÂ Â» dimension model parameters are the most stringent to date in this channel.Â«Â less DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Bharucha, A.; Bigi, I. I.; Bobeth, C. During 2011 the LHCb experiment at CERN collected 1.0 fb -1 of âs=7~TeV pp collisions. Due to the large heavy quark production cross-sections, these data provide unprecedented samples of heavy flavoured hadrons. The first results from LHCb have made a significant impact on the flavour physics landscape and have definitively proved the concept of a dedicated experiment in the forward region at a hadron collider. This document discusses the implications of these first measurements on classes of extensions to the Standard Model, bearing in mind the interplay with the results of searches for on-shell production of new particles at ATLASmoreÂ Â» and CMS. The physics potential of an upgrade to the LHCb detector, which would allow an order of magnitude more data to be collected, is emphasised.Â«Â less The TOTEM Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) TOTEM Collaboration; Anelli, G.; Antchev, G.; Aspell, P.; Avati, V.; Bagliesi, M.

To achieve optimum forward coverage for charged particles emitted by the pp collisions in the interaction point IP5, two tracking telescopes, T1 and T2, will be installed on each side in the pseudorapidity region 3.1 <= |Î·| <= 6.5, and Roman Pot stations will be placed at distances of Â±147 m and Â±220 m from IP5. Being an independent experiment but technically integrated into CMS, TOTEM will first operate in standalone mode to pursue its own physics programme and at a later stage together with CMS for a common physics programme. This article gives a description of the TOTEM apparatus and its performance.

The data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb-1. No deviations are observed relative to the predictions of the standard model. The results are interpreted as exclusion limits on the dark matter production cross sections and parameters in models containing extra spatial dimensions. Improved limits are set with respect to previous searches using the monophoton final state. In particular, the limits on the extra dimension model parameters are the most stringent to date in this channel. [Figure not available: see fulltext. Design of the cryogenic systems for the Near and Far LAr-TPC detectors of the Short-Baseline Neutrino program (SBN) at Fermilab DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Geynisman, M.; Bremer, J.; Chalifour, M. The Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program at Fermilab and Neutrino Platform (NP) at CERN are part of the international Neutrino Program leading to the development of Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (LBNF/DUNE) science project. The SBN program consisting of three Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) detectors positioned along the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab includes an existing detector known as MicroBooNE (170-ton LAr-TPC) plus two new experiments known as SBNâs Near Detector (SBND, ~260 tons) and SBNâs Far Detector (SBN-FD, ~760 tons). All three detectors have distinctly different design of their cryostats thus defining specific requirements formoreÂ Â» the cryogenic systems. Fermilab has already built two new facilities to house SBND and SBN-FD detectors. The cryogenic systems for these detectors are in various stages of design and construction with CERN and Fermilab being responsible for delivery of specific sub-systems.

The experiments would profit from a lower beam energy, but this extraction energy is the lowest one possible under good conditions with the given circumference of the AD. The Extra Low Energy Antiproton ring (ELENA) is a small synchrotron with a circumference a factor of 6 smaller than the AD to further decelerate antiprotons from the AD from 5.3 MeV to 100 keV. Controlled deceleration in a synchrotron equipped with an electron cooler to reduce emittances in all three planes will allow the existing AD experiments to increase substantially their antiproton capture efficiencies and render new experiments possible. ELENA ring commissioning is taking place at present and first beams to a new experiment installed in a new experimental area are foreseen in 2017. The transfer lines from ELENA to existing experiments in the old experimental area will be installed during CERN Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) in 2019 and 2020. The status of the project and ring commissioning will be reported. This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue `Antiproton physics in the ELENA era'. Plans for an ERL Test Facility at CERN DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Jensen, Erik; Bruning, O S; Calaga, Buchi Rama Rao 2014-12-01 The baseline electron accelerator for LHeC and one option for FCC-he is an Energy Recovery Linac. To prepare and study the necessary key technologies, CERNhas started â in collaboration with JLAB and Mainz University â the conceptual design of an ERL Test Facility (ERL-TF). Staged construction will allow the study under different conditions with up to 3 passes, beam energies of up to about 1 GeV and currents of up to 50 mA. The design and development of superconducting cavity modules, including coupler and HOM damper designs, are also of central importance for other existing and future accelerators and theirmoreÂ Â» tests are at the heart of the current ERL-TF goals. However, the ERL-TF could also provide a unique infrastructure for several applications that go beyond developing and testing the ERL technology at CERN. In addition to experimental studies of beam dynamics, operational and reliability issues in an ERL, it could equally serve for quench tests of superconducting magnets, as physics experimental facility on its own right or as test stand for detector developments. This contribution will describe the goals and the concept of the facility and the status of the R&D.Â«Â less A practical approach to virtualization in HEP NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Buncic, P.; Aguado SÃ¡nchez, C.; Blomer, J.; Harutyunyan, A.; Mudrinic, M. 2011-01-01 In the attempt to solve the problem of processing data coming from LHC experiments at CERN at a rate of 15PB per year, for almost a decade the High Enery Physics (HEP) community has focused its efforts on the development of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. This generated large interest and expectations promising to revolutionize computing. Meanwhile, having initially taken part in the Grid standardization process, industry has moved in a different direction and started promoting the Cloud Computing paradigm which aims to solve problems on a similar scale and in equally seamless way as it was expected in the idealized Grid approach. A key enabling technology behind Cloud computing is server virtualization. In early 2008, an R&D project was established in the PH-SFT group at CERN to investigate how virtualization technology could be used to improve and simplify the daily interaction of physicists with experiment software frameworks and the Grid infrastructure. In this article we shall first briefly compare Grid and Cloud computing paradigms and then summarize the results of the R&D activity pointing out where and how virtualization technology could be effectively used in our field in order to maximize practical benefits whilst avoiding potential pitfalls. Comparison of Theoretically Predicted Electromagnetic Heavy Ion Cross Sections with CERN SPS and RHIC Data NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Baltz, Anthony J. 2002-10-01 Theoretical predictions for a number of electromagnetically induced reactions have been compared with available ultrarelativistic heavy ion data. Calculations for three atomic process have been confronted with CERN SPS data. Theoretically predicted rates are in good agreement with data[1] for bound-electron positron pairs and ionization of single electron heavy ions. Furthermore, the exact solution of the semi-classical Dirac equation in the ultrarelativistic limit reproduces the perturbative scaling result seen in data[2] for continuum pairs (i.e. cross sections go as Z_1^2 Z_2^2). In the area of electromagnetically induced nuclear and hadronic physics, mutual Coulomb dissociation predictions are in good agreement with RHIC Zero Degree Calorimeter measurements[3], and calculations of coherent vector meson production accompanied by mutual Coulomb dissociation[4] are in good agreement with RHIC STAR data[5].

Design of the cryogenic systems for the Near and Far LAr-TPC detectors of the Short-Baseline Neutrino program (SBN) at Fermilab NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Geynisman, M.; Bremer, J.; Chalifour, M.; Delaney, M.; Dinnon, M.; Doubnik, R.; Hentschel, S.; Kim, M. J.; Montanari, C.; Montanari, D.; Nichols, T.; Norris, B.; Sarychev, M.; Schwartz, F.; Tillman, J.; Zuckerbrot, M. 2017-12-01 The Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program at Fermilab and Neutrino Platform (NP) at CERN are part of the international Neutrino Program leading to the development of Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (LBNF/DUNE) science project. The SBN program consisting of three Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) detectors positioned along the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab includes an existing detector known as MicroBooNE (170-ton LAr-TPC) plus two new experiments known as SBNâs Near Detector (SBND, â¼260 tons) and SBNâs Far Detector (SBN-FD, â¼760 tons). All three detectors have distinctly different design of their cryostats thus defining specific requirements for the cryogenic systems. Fermilab has already built two new facilities to house SBND and SBN-FD detectors. The cryogenic systems for these detectors are in various stages of design and construction with CERN and Fermilab being responsible for delivery of specific sub-systems. This contribution presents specific design requirements and typical implementation solutions for each sub-system of the SBND and SBN-FD cryogenic systems. Managing a tier-2 computer centre with a private cloud infrastructure NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Bagnasco, Stefano; Berzano, Dario; Brunetti, Riccardo; Lusso, Stefano; Vallero, Sara 2014-06-01 In a typical scientific computing centre, several applications coexist and share a single physical infrastructure. An underlying Private Cloud infrastructure eases the management and maintenance of such heterogeneous applications (such as multipurpose or application-specific batch farms, Grid sites, interactive data analysis facilities and others), allowing dynamic allocation resources to any application. Furthermore, the maintenance of large deployments of complex and rapidly evolving middleware and application software is eased by the use of virtual images and contextualization techniques. Such infrastructures are being deployed in some large centres (see e.g. the CERN Agile Infrastructure project), but with several open-source tools reaching maturity this is becoming viable also for smaller sites. In this contribution we describe the Private Cloud infrastructure at the INFN-Torino Computer Centre, that hosts a full-fledged WLCG Tier-2 centre, an Interactive Analysis Facility for the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC and several smaller scientific computing applications. The private cloud building blocks include the OpenNebula software stack, the GlusterFS filesystem and the OpenWRT Linux distribution (used for network virtualization); a future integration into a federated higher-level infrastructure is made possible by exposing commonly used APIs like EC2 and OCCI. The Effect of Jigsaw Technique on the Students' Laboratory Material Recognition and Usage Skills in General Physics Laboratory-I Course ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Aydin, Abdullah; Biyikli, Filiz 2017-01-01 This research aims to compare the effects of Jigsaw technique from the cooperative learning methods and traditional learning method on laboratory material recognition and usage skills of students in General Physics Lab-I Course. This study was conducted with 63 students who took general physics laboratory-I course in the department of scienceâ¦ Implementation of Scientific Community Laboratories and Their Effect on Student Conceptual Learning, Attitudes, and Understanding of Uncertainty NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Lark, Adam Scientific Community Laboratories, developed by The University of Maryland, have shown initial promise as laboratories meant to emulate the practice of doing physics. These laboratories have been re-created by incorporating their design elements with the University of Toledo course structure and resources. The laboratories have been titled the Scientific Learning Community (SLC) Laboratories. A comparative study between these SLC laboratories and the University of Toledo physics department's traditional laboratories was executed during the fall 2012 semester on first semester calculus-based physics students. Three tests were executed as pre-test and post-tests to capture the change in students' concept knowledge, attitudes, and understanding of uncertainty. The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was used to evaluate students' conceptual changes through the semester and average normalized gains were compared between both traditional and SLC laboratories. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) was conducted to elucidate students' change in attitudes through the course of each laboratory. Finally, interviews regarding data analysis and uncertainty were transcribed and coded to track changes in the way students understand uncertainty and data analysis in experimental physics after their participation in both laboratory type. Students in the SLC laboratories showed a notable an increase conceptual knowledge and attitudes when compared to traditional laboratories. SLC students' understanding of uncertainty showed most improvement, diverging completely from students in the traditional laboratories, who declined throughout the semester. Attitudes of Healthcare Students on Gross Anatomy Laboratory Sessions ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Kawashiro, Yukiko; Anahara, Reiko; Kohno, Toshihiko; Mori, Chisato; Matsuno, Yoshiharu 2009-01-01 At Chiba University, gross anatomy laboratory sessions (\"laboratories\") are required for physical therapy students. Though most physical therapy schools require their students to participate in laboratories so that they will better understand the structure of the human body, few data exist on the value of these laboratories specificallyâ¦ How can laboratory plasma experiments contribute to space and &astrophysics? NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Yamada, M. Plasma physics plays key role in a wide range of phenomena in the universe, from laboratory plasmas to the magnetosphere, the solar corona, and to the tenuous interstellar and intergalactic gas. Despite the huge difference in physical scales, there are striking similarities in plasma behavior of laboratory and space plasmas. Similar plasma physics problems have been investigated independently by both laboratory plasma physicists and astrophysicists. Since 1991, cross fertilization has been increased among laboratory plasma physicists and space physicists through meeting such as IPELS [Interrelationship between Plasma Experiments in the Laboratory and Space] meeting. The advances in laboratory plasma physics, along with the recent surge of astronomical data from satellites, make this moment ripe for research collaboration to further advance plasma physics and to obtain new understanding of key space and astrophysical phenomena. The recent NRC review of astronomy and astrophysics notes the benefit that can accrue from stronger connection to plasma physics. The present talk discusses how laboratory plasma studies can contribute to the fundamental understandings of the space and astrophysical phenomena by covering common key physics topics such as magnetic reconnection, dynamos, angular momentum transport, ion heating, and magnetic self-organization. In particular, it has recently been recognized that \"physics -issue- dedicated\" laboratory experiments can contribute significantly to the understanding of the fundamental physics for space-astrophysical phenomena since they can create fundamental physics processes in controlled manner and provide well-correlated plasma parameters at multiple plasma locations simultaneously. Such dedicated experiments not only can bring about better understanding of the fundamental physics processes but also can lead to findings of new physics principles as well as new ideas for fusion plasma confinement. Several dedicated experiments have provided the fundamental physics data for magnetic reconnection [1]. Linear plasma devices have been utilized to investigate Whistler waves and Alfven wave phenomena [2,3]. A rotating gallium disk experiment has been initiated to study magneto-rotational instability [4]. This talk also presents the most recent progress of these dedicated laboratory plasma research. 1.

Microcomputer-based laboratories (MBLs) have been defined as software that uses an electronic probe to collect information about a physical system and then converts that information into graphical systems in real-time. Realtime Physics Laboratories (RTP) are an example of laboratories that combine the use of MBLs with collaboration and guided-inquiry. RTP Mechanics Laboratories include both laboratory activities and laboratory homework for the first semester of college freshman physics courses. Prior research has investigated the effectiveness of the RTP laboratories as a package (laboratory activities with laboratory homework). In this study, an experimental-treatment had students complete both the RTP laboratory activity and the associated laboratory homework during the same laboratory period. Observations of this treatment indicated that students primarily consulted the laboratory instructor and referred to their completed laboratory activity while completing the homework in their collaborative groups. In the control-treatment, students completed the laboratory homework outside the laboratory period. Measures of force and motion conceptual understanding included the Force and Motion Conceptual Understanding (FMCE), a 47 multiple-choice question test. Analyses of the FMCE indicated that it is both a reliable and a valid measure of force and motion conceptual understanding. A distinct, five-factor structure for the FMCE post-test answers reflected specific concepts related to force and motion. However, the three FMCE pretest factors were less distinct. Analysis of the experimental-treatment, compared to a control-treatment, included multiple regression analysis with covariates of age, prior physics-classroom experience, and the three FMCE pretest factors. Criterion variables included each of the five post-test factors, the total laboratory homework score, and a group of seven exam questions. The results were all positive, in favor of the experimental-treatment. However, the results were significant only with the criterions of the FMCE post-test factor \"Concepts Regarding Newton's First and Second Laws\" and the laboratory homework score. The interaction between the treatments and prior physics-classroom experience was not significant. Implications of the qualitative and quantitative findings are discussed.

Determination and Fabrication of New Shield Super Alloys Materials for Nuclear Reactor Safety by Experiments and Cern-Fluka Monte Carlo Simulation Code, Geant4 and WinXCom NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Aygun, BÃ¼nyamin; Korkut, Turgay; Karabulut, Abdulhalik 2016-05-01 Despite the possibility of depletion of fossil fuels increasing energy needs the use of radiation tends to increase. Recently the security-focused debate about planned nuclear power plants still continues. The objective of this thesis is to prevent the radiation spread from nuclear reactors into the environment. In order to do this, we produced higher performanced of new shielding materials which are high radiation holders in reactors operation. Some additives used in new shielding materials; some of iron (Fe), rhenium (Re), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), boron (B), copper (Cu), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), boron carbide (B4C). The results of this experiments indicated that these materials are good shields against gamma and neutrons. The powder metallurgy technique was used to produce new shielding materials. CERN - FLUKA Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation code and WinXCom were used for determination of the percentages of high temperature resistant and high-level fast neutron and gamma shielding materials participated components. Super alloys was produced and then the experimental fast neutron dose equivalent measurements and gamma radiation absorpsion of the new shielding materials were carried out. The produced products to be used safely reactors not only in nuclear medicine, in the treatment room, for the storage of nuclear waste, nuclear research laboratories, against cosmic radiation in space vehicles and has the qualities.

It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 Ã 16 Ã 26 m3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008. Review of CERN Data Centre Infrastructure NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Andrade, P.; Bell, T.; van Eldik, J.; McCance, G.; Panzer-Steindel, B.; Coelho dos Santos, M.; Traylen and, S.; Schwickerath, U. 2012-12-01 The CERN Data Centre is reviewing strategies for optimizing the use of the existing infrastructure and expanding to a new data centre by studying how other large sites are being operated. Over the past six months, CERN has been investigating modern and widely-used tools and procedures used for virtualisation, clouds and fabric management in order to reduce operational effort, increase agility and support unattended remote data centres. This paper gives the details on the project's motivations, current status and areas for future investigation. Report of the Physics Gender Equity Workshop (May 2007) at APS NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Berrah, Nora 2008-04-01 The Committee of the Status of Women in Physics (CSWP) of the American Physical Society (APS) organized and held a national workshop entitled ``Gender Equity: Strengthening the Physics Enterprise in Universities and National Laboratories'' to focus on addressing the gender gap in the field of physics. The major aim of the workshop was to facilitate a doubling of the number of women in physics, in both academia and national laboratories, over the next 15 years. The active participation of physics department chairs, national laboratory managers, and federal agencies allowed exciting collective work that enabled new ideas to emerge, both to make the field of physics more attractive to women and men, and to find effective ways to retain women in physics. The group also generated a set of recommendations that can be applied at any physics department or national laboratory unit [1]. A report from this workshop will be presented.

The outcomes are known in advance and students replicate procedures recommended by the teacher. Over the years, I have come to appreciate the great opportunities created by allowing students investigative freedom in physics laboratories. I have realized that a laboratory environment in which students are free to conduct investigations using procedures of their own design can provide them with varied and rich opportunities for discovery. This paper describes what open-ended laboratory investigations have added to my high school physics classes. I will provide several examples of open-ended laboratories and discuss the benefits they conferred on students and teacher alike.

The laboratory is equipped with a Hall-probe bench working in on-the-fly measurement mode allowing the measurement of field maps of big magnetic structures with high accuracy, both in magnetic field magnitude and position. The whole control system of this bench is based on TANGO. The Hall probe calibration range extends between sub-Gauss to 2 Tesla with an accuracy of 100 ppm. Apart from the Hall probe bench, the ID laboratory has a flipping coil bench dedicated to measuring field integrals and a Helmholtz coil bench specially designed to characterize permanent magnet blocks. Also, a fixed stretched wire bench is used to measure field integrals of magnet sets. This device is specifically dedicated to ID construction. Finally, the laboratory is equipped with a rotating coil bench, specially designed for measuring multipolar devices used in accelerators, such as quadrupoles, sextupoles, etc. Recent improvements of the magnetic measurements laboratory of ALBA synchrotron include the design and manufacturing of very thin 3D Hall probe heads, the design and manufacturing of coil sensors for the Rotating coil bench based on multilayered PCB, and the improvement of calibration methodology in order to improve the accuracy of the measurements. ALBA magnetic measurements laboratory is open for external contracts, and has been widely used by national and international institutes such as CERN, ESRF or CIEMAT, as well as magnet manufacturing companies, such as ANTEC, TESLA and I3 M. In this paper, we will present the main features of the measurement benches as well as improvements made so far. Oral anatomy laboratory examinations in a physical therapy program. PubMed Fabrizio, Philip A 2013-01-01 The process of creating and administering traditional tagged anatomy laboratory examinations is time consuming for instructors and limits laboratory access for students. Depending on class size and the number of class, sections, creating, administering, and breaking down a tagged laboratory examination may involve one to two eight-hour days. During the time that a tagged examination is being created, student productivity may be reduced as the anatomy laboratory is inaccessible to students. Further, the type of questions that can be asked in a tagged laboratory examination may limit student assessment to lower level cognitive abilities and may limit the instructors' ability to assess the students' understanding of anatomical and clinical concepts. Anatomy is a foundational science in the Physical Therapy curriculum and a thorough understanding of anatomy is necessary to progress through the subsequent clinical courses. Physical therapy curricula have evolved to reflect the changing role of physical therapists to primary caregivers by introducing a greater scope of clinical courses earlier in the curriculum. Physical therapy students must have a thorough understanding of clinical anatomy early in the education process. However, traditional anatomy examination methods may not be reflective of the clinical thought processes required of physical therapy students. Traditional laboratory examination methods also reduce student productivity by limiting access during examination set-up and breakdown. To provide a greater complexity of questions and reduced overall laboratory time required for examinations, the Physical Therapy Program at Mercer University has introduced oral laboratory examinations for the gross anatomy course series.

Introduction of optical tweezers in advanced physics laboratory NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wang, Gang 2017-08-01 Laboratories are an essential part of undergraduate optoelectronics and photonics education. Of particular interest are the sequence of laboratories which offer students meaningful research experience within a reasonable time-frame limited by regular laboratory hours. We will present our introduction of optical tweezers into the upper-level physics laboratory. We developed the sequence of experiments in the Advanced Lab to offer students sufficient freedom to explore, rather than simply setting up a demonstration following certain recipes. We will also present its impact on our current curriculum of optoelectronics concentration within the physics program. Epistemology and Expectations Survey about Experimental Physics: Development and Initial Results ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Zwickl, Benjamin M.; Hirokawa, Takako; Finkelstein, Noah; Lewandowski, H. J. 2014-01-01 In response to national calls to better align physics laboratory courses with the way physicists engage in research, we have developed an epistemology and expectations survey to assess how students perceive the nature of physics experiments in the contexts of laboratory courses and the professional research laboratory.

Towards Polarized Antiprotons at FAIR NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Rathmann, Frank 2007-06-01 Understanding the interplay of the nuclear interaction with polarized protons and the electromagnetic interaction with polarized electrons in polarized atoms is crucial to progress towards the PAX goal to eventually produce stored polarized antiproton beams at FAIR. Presently, there exist two competing theoretical scenarios: one with substantial spin filtering of (anti)protons by atomic electrons, and a second one suggesting a self-cancellation of the electron contribution to spin filtering. After a brief review of the PAX physics case for polarized antiprotons at FAIR, a detailed discussion of future investigations, including spin-filtering experiments at COSY-JÃ¼lich and at the AD of CERN is presented. The Higgs mechanism and the origin of mass NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Djouadi, Abdelhak 2012-06-01 The Higgs mechanism plays a key role in the physics of elementary particles: in the context of the Standard Model, the theory which describes in a unified framework the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear interactions, it allows for the generation of particle masses while preserving the fundamental symmetries of the theory. This mechanism predicts the existence of a new type of particle, the scalar Higgs boson, with unique characteristics. The detection of this particle and the study of its fundamental properties is a major goal of high-energy particle colliders, such as the CERN Large Hadron Collider or LHC.

Robert R. Wilson Prize III: Applications of Intrabeam Scattering Formulae to a Myriad of Accelerator Systems NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mtingwa, Sekazi K. 2017-01-01 We discuss our entree into accelerator physics and the problem of intrabeam scattering in particular. We focus on the historical importance of understanding intrabeam scattering for the successful operation of Fermilab's Accumulator and Tevatron and the subsequent hunt for the top quark, and its importance for successful operation of CERN's Large Hadron Collider that discovered the Higgs boson. We provide details on intrabeam scattering formalisms for hadron and electron beams at high energies, concluding with an Ansatz by Karl Bane that has applications to electron damping rings and synchrotron light sources. « 21 22 23 24 25 » « 21 22 23 24 25 » 2016 Research Outreach Program report DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Lee, Hye Young; Kim, Yangkyu 2016-10-13 This paper is the research activity report for 4 weeks in LANL. Under the guidance of Dr. Lee, who performs nuclear physics research at LANSCE, LANL, I studied the Low Energy NZ (LENZ) setup and how to use the LENZ. First, I studied the LENZ chamber and Si detectors, and worked on detector calibrations, using the computer software, ROOT (CERN developed data analysis tool) and EXCEL (Microsoft office software). I also performed the calibration experiments that measure alpha particles emitted from a Th-229 source by using a S1-type detector (Si detector). And with Dr. Lee, we checked the result. Commissioning of a CERN Production and Analysis Facility Based on xrootd NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Campana, Simone; van der Ster, Daniel C.; Di Girolamo, Alessandro; Peters, Andreas J.; Duellmann, Dirk; Coelho Dos Santos, Miguel; Iven, Jan; Bell, Tim 2011-12-01 The CERN facility hosts the Tier-0 of the four LHC experiments, but as part of WLCG it also offers a platform for production activities and user analysis. The CERN CASTOR storage technology has been extensively tested and utilized for LHC data recording and exporting to external sites according to experiments computing model. On the other hand, to accommodate Grid data processing activities and, more importantly, chaotic user analysis, it was realized that additional functionality was needed including a different throttling mechanism for file access. This paper will describe the xroot-based CERN production and analysis facility for the ATLAS experiment and in particular the experiment use case and data access scenario, the xrootd redirector setup on top of the CASTOR storage system, the commissioning of the system and real life experience for data processing and data analysis. CERN alerterâRSS based system for information broadcast to all CERN offices NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Otto, R. 2008-07-01 Nearly every large organization uses a tool to broadcast messages and information across the internal campus (messages like alerts announcing interruption in services or just information about upcoming events). These tools typically allow administrators (operators) to send 'targeted' messages which are sent only to specific groups of users or computers, e/g only those located in a specified building or connected to a particular computing service. CERN has a long history of such tools: CERNVMS's SPM_quotMESSAGE command, Zephyr [2] and the most recent the NICE Alerter based on the NNTP protocol. The NICE Alerter used on all Windows-based computers had to be phased out as a consequence of phasing out NNTP at CERN. The new solution to broadcast information messages on the CERN campus continues to provide the service based on cross-platform technologies, hence minimizing custom developments and relying on commercial software as much as possible. The new system, called CERN Alerter, is based on RSS (Really Simple Syndication) [9] for the transport protocol and uses Microsoft SharePoint as the backend for database and posting interface. The windows-based client relies on Internet Explorer 7.0 with custom code to trigger the window pop-ups and the notifications for new events. Linux and Mac OS X clients could also rely on any RSS readers to subscribe to targeted notifications. The paper covers the architecture and implementation aspects of the new system.

(MT) FOREWORD: TAUP 2005: Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Bottino, Alessandro; Coccia, Eugenio; Morales, Julio; PuimedÃ³nv, Jorge 2006-04-01 The ninth meeting of the TAUP Workshop Series, TAUP 2005, was organized by the University of Zaragoza and Laboratorio SubterrÃ¡neo de Canfranc, jointly with the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN). It was dedicated to the memory of professor Angel Morales, co-founder of the TAUP Series and a central figure in the scientific shaping and organization of the TAUP conferences since their inception in 1989. He and his group of collaborators laid, twenty years ago, the foundations of underground physics in Spain. To have TAUP 2005 hosted by the University of Zaragoza was a tangible way of honouring his memory. The Conference was concluded by a visit to the new installations of the Canfranc Laboratory, where a memorial ceremony was held in honour of Angel Morales, the driving force for the creation of that Laboratory. In TAUP 2005 all the various aspects of Astroparticle Physics have been covered, from Cosmology and Dark Constituents, to Gravitational Waves, to Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics, to High Energy Astrophysics, to Cosmic Rays and Gamma-Rays Astronomy. New and important scientific results were presented and debated in the plenary review talks and in a very large number of contributions in topical parallel sessions. As editors of these proceedings, we hope that this volume, which contains most of the talks and contributions presented at TAUP 2005, will provide a detailed state-of-the-art account of the various facets of Astroparticle Physics. We thank all the invited speakers and contributors who made this possible. Full coverage of the transparencies presented at the conference can be found on the website http://www.unizar.es/taup2005. At TAUP 2005 a memorial lecture was delivered by Art McDonald to commemorate John Bahcall, who passed away prematurely in August 2005. In this talk, his figure, as a pioneer and leader in the fields of Neutrino Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics and as a man of great personal qualities, was illustrated. The TAUP Steering Committee recalls with deep gratitude that John Bahcall served continuously as a member of the TAUP International Advisory Committee and that he gave an inspired and brilliant conclusive talk at TAUP 2003 in Seattle. Our astroparticle community will miss him greatly. The TAUP 2005 Organizing Committee thanks Ministerio de EducaciÃ³n y Ciencia, Gobierno de AragÃ³n, Zaragoza University, INFN, IUPAP, PaNAGIC and Ibercaja for sponsoring the Conference, and the Rector and Vice-Rector of the Zaragoza University for their hospitality in the magnificent Paraninfo Palace, where the meeting was held. We wish to thank Venya Berezinsky, JosÃ© BernabÃ©u and JosÃ© Angel Villar for their invaluable contribution in the scientific shaping of the conference and in the preparation of the present volume. Very special thanks are due to Ms Mercedes FatÃ¡s and Ms Franca Masciulli, our workshop secretaries, for their continuous and excellent work in the organization of the conference, and to Ms Leopolda Benazzato for her invaluable assistance during the conference. We also gratefully thank the technical staff: Cristina Gil, Francisco Javier Mena and Alfonso Ortiz de SolÃ³rzano for their invaluable help. As announced at the end of the conference, TAUP 2007 will be held in Sendai, Japan, hosted by the Tohoku University with the chairs of Professors Atsuto Suzuki and Kunio Inoue.

Zaragoza The Scanning Electron Microscope As An Accelerator For The Undergraduate Advanced Physics Laboratory NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Peterson, Randolph S.; Berggren, Karl K.; Mondol, Mark 2011-06-01 Few universities or colleges have an accelerator for use with advanced physics laboratories, but many of these institutions have a scanning electron microscope (SEM) on site, often in the biology department. As an accelerator for the undergraduate, advanced physics laboratory, the SEM is an excellent substitute for an ion accelerator. Although there are no nuclear physics experiments that can be performed with a typical 30 kV SEM, there is an opportunity for experimental work on accelerator physics, atomic physics, electron-solid interactions, and the basics of modern e-beam lithography. Physics with thermal antiprotons DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Hynes, M.V.; Campbell, L.J. 1988-01-01 The same beam cooling techniques that have allowed for high luminosity antiproton experiments at high energy also provide the opportunity for experiments at ultra-low energy. Through a series of deceleration stages, antiprotons collected and cooled at the peak momentum for production can by made available at thermal or sub-thermal energies. In particular, the CERN, PS-200 collaboration is developing an RFO-plused ion trap beam line for the antiproton gravitational mass experiment at LEAR that will provide beams of antiprotons in the energy range 0.001--1000.0 eV. Antiprotons at these energies make these fundamentals particles available for experiments in condensed matter and atomicmoreÂ Â» physics. The recent speculation that antiprotons may form metastable states in some forms of normal matter could open many new avenues of basic and applied research. 7 refs., 3 figs.Â«Â less Search for physics beyond the standard model in events with two leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum in pp collisions at âs = 8 TeV DOE PAGES Khachatryan, Vardan 2015-04-22 Our search is presented for physics beyond the standard model in final states with two opposite-sign same-flavor leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.4 fb -1 of proton-proton collisions at âs = 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2012. The analysis focuses on searches for a kinematic edge in the invariant mass distribution of the oppositesign same-flavor lepton pair and for final states with an on-shell Z boson. Furthermore, the observations are consistent with expectations from standard model processes and are interpreted in terms ofmoreÂ Â» upper limits on the production of supersymmetric particles.Â«Â less Implications of LHCb measurements and future prospects DOE PAGES Bharucha, A.; Bigi, I. I.; Bobeth, C.; ... 2013-04-26 During 2011 the LHCb experiment at CERN collected 1.0 fb -1 of âs=7~TeV pp collisions. Due to the large heavy quark production cross-sections, these data provide unprecedented samples of heavy flavoured hadrons. The first results from LHCb have made a significant impact on the flavour physics landscape and have definitively proved the concept of a dedicated experiment in the forward region at a hadron collider. This document discusses the implications of these first measurements on classes of extensions to the Standard Model, bearing in mind the interplay with the results of searches for on-shell production of new particles at ATLASmoreÂ Â» and CMS. The physics potential of an upgrade to the LHCb detector, which would allow an order of magnitude more data to be collected, is emphasised.Â«Â less Coastal Oceanography in the Beaufort Sea, Summer 1985.

Various types of microprocessor applications are discussed and the main emphasis of the paper is devoted to 'embedded' systems, where the software development is not carried out on the target microprocessor. Some information is provided on the general characteristics of microprocessor hardware. Various types of microprocessor operating system are compared and contrasted. The selection of appropriate languages and software environments for use with microprocessors is discussed. Mechanisms for interworking between different languages, including reasonable error handling, are treated. The CERN developed cross-software suite for the Motorola 68000 family is described. Some remarks are made concerning program tools applicable to microprocessors. PILS, a Portable Interactive Language System, which can be interpreted or compiled for a range of microprocessors, is described in some detail, and the implementation techniques are discussed. Exploratory Lattice QCD Study of the Rare Kaon Decay K^{+}âÏ^{+}Î½Î½[over Â¯]. PubMed Bai, Ziyuan; Christ, Norman H; Feng, Xu; Lawson, Andrew; Portelli, Antonin; Sachrajda, Christopher T 2017-06-23 We report a first, complete lattice QCD calculation of the long-distance contribution to the K^{+}âÏ^{+}Î½Î½[over Â¯] decay within the standard model. This is a second-order weak process involving two four-Fermi operators that is highly sensitive to new physics and being studied by the NA62 experiment at CERN. While much of this decay comes from perturbative, short-distance physics, there is a long-distance part, perhaps as large as the planned experimental error, which involves nonperturbative phenomena. The calculation presented here, with unphysical quark masses, demonstrates that this contribution can be computed using lattice methods by overcoming three technical difficulties: (i)Â a short-distance divergence that results when the two weak operators approach each other, (ii)Â exponentially growing, unphysical terms that appear in Euclidean, second-order perturbation theory, and (iii)Â potentially large finite-volume effects. A follow-on calculation with physical quark masses and controlled systematic errors will be possible with the next generation of computers.

They must be able to communicate effectively on their joint projects at any time; as a result telephone conferences have become indispensable and widely used. Managed by 6 operators, CERN already has more than 20000 hours and 5700 audio-conferences per year. However, the traditional telephone based audio-conference system needed to be modernized in three ways. Firstly, to provide the participants with more autonomy in the organization of their conferences; secondly, to eliminate the constraints of manual intervention by operators; and thirdly, to integrate the audio-conferences into a collaborative working framework. The large number, and hence cost, of the conferences prohibited externalization and so the CERN telecommunications team drew up a specification to implement a new system. It was decided to use a new commercial collaborative audio-conference solution based on the SIP protocol. The system was tested as the first European pilot and several improvements (such as billing, security, redundancy...) were implemented based on CERN's recommendations. The new automatic conference system has been operational since the second half of 2006. It is very popular for the users and has doubled the number of conferences in the past two years. CERN openlab: Engaging industry for innovation in the LHC Run 3-4 R&D programme NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Girone, M.; Purcell, A.; Di Meglio, A.; Rademakers, F.; Gunne, K.; Pachou, M.; Pavlou, S. 2017-10-01 LHC Run3 and Run4 represent an unprecedented challenge for HEP computing in terms of both data volume and complexity. New approaches are needed for how data is collected and filtered, processed, moved, stored and analysed if these challenges are to be met with a realistic budget. To develop innovative techniques we are fostering relationships with industry leaders. CERN openlab is a unique resource for public-private partnership between CERN and leading Information Communication and Technology (ICT) companies. Its mission is to accelerate the development of cutting-edge solutions to be used by the worldwide HEP community. In 2015, CERN openlab started its phase V with a strong focus on tackling the upcoming LHC challenges. Several R&D programs are ongoing in the areas of data acquisition, networks and connectivity, data storage architectures, computing provisioning, computing platforms and code optimisation and data analytics. This paper gives an overview of the various innovative technologies that are currently being explored by CERN openlab V and discusses the long-term strategies that are pursued by the LHC communities with the help of industry in closing the technological gap in processing and storage needs expected in Run3 and Run4. Measurements and FLUKA simulations of bismuth and aluminium activation at the CERN Shielding Benchmark Facility (CSBF) NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Iliopoulou, E.; Bamidis, P.; Brugger, M.; Froeschl, R.; Infantino, A.; Kajimoto, T.; Nakao, N.; Roesler, S.; Sanami, T.; Siountas, A. 2018-03-01 The CERN High Energy AcceleRator Mixed field facility (CHARM) is located in the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) East Experimental Area. The facility receives a pulsed proton beam from the CERN PS with a beam momentum of 24 GeV/c with 5 á¹¡1011 protons per pulse with a pulse length of 350 ms and with a maximum average beam intensity of 6.7 á¹¡1010 p/s that then impacts on the CHARM target. The shielding of the CHARM facility also includes the CERN Shielding Benchmark Facility (CSBF) situated laterally above the target. This facility consists of 80 cm of cast iron and 360 cm of concrete with barite concrete in some places. Activation samples of bismuth and aluminium were placed in the CSBF and in the CHARM access corridor in July 2015. Monte Carlo simulations with the FLUKA code have been performed to estimate the specific production yields for these samples. The results estimated by FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations are compared to activation measurements of these samples. The comparison between FLUKA simulations and the measured values from Î³-spectrometry gives an agreement better than a factor of 2.

These include the ability to interpret the meaning of the graph to make an appropriate conclusion. This particular study analyses the graphical representation among freshmen in an undergraduate physics laboratory. This study uses empirical study with quantitative approach. The graphical representation covers 3 physics topics: velocity of sound, simple pendulum and spring system. The result of this study shows most of the freshmen (90% of the sample) make a graph based on the data from physics laboratory. It means the transferring process of raw data which illustrated in the table to physics graph can be categorised. Most of the Freshmen use the proportional principle of the variable in graph analysis. However, Freshmen can't make the graph in an appropriate variable to gain more information and can't analyse the graph to obtain the useful information from the slope. OPERA experiment and its releted emulsion techniques DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV) Ariga, Akitaka 2008-02-21 The OPERA experiment is designed to clarify neutrino oscillation by detecting appearance of {nu}{sub {tau}} in pure {nu}{sub {mu}} beam through a long baseline method (CNGS beam from cern to the Gran Sasso laboratory). The key technique is the use of emulsion films and their scanning. We developed a new high speed scanning system with speed of 50 cm{sup 2}/h and it was successfully demonstrated in 2006 CNGS commissioning. The new scanning system is not only meant for the OPERA experiment, but it has large potential of applications. For example, measurement of {nu}{sub e} with strong separation power against {pi}{supmoreÂ Â» 0}. Or a compact emulsion spectrometer for future neutrino experiments.Â«Â less Some Unsolved Problems, Questions, and Applications of the Brightsen Nucleon Cluster Model NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Smarandache, Florentin 2010-10-01 Brightsen Model is opposite to the Standard Model, and it was build on John Weeler's Resonating Group Structure Model and on Linus Pauling's Close-Packed Spheron Model. Among Brightsen Model's predictions and applications we cite the fact that it derives the average number of prompt neutrons per fission event, it provides a theoretical way for understanding the low temperature / low energy reactions and for approaching the artificially induced fission, it predicts that forces within nucleon clusters are stronger than forces between such clusters within isotopes; it predicts the unmatter entities inside nuclei that result from stable and neutral union of matter and antimatter, and so on. But these predictions have to be tested in the future at the new CERN laboratory.

And finally, particle colliders, like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, allow researchers to smash protons together and analyze the debris left behind by such collisions. Physicists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, however, are taking a different approach: they are using computers.

FOREWORD: Extreme QCD 2012 (xQCD) NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Alexandru, Andrei; Bazavov, Alexei; Liu, Keh-Fei 2013-04-01 The Extreme QCD 2012 conference, held at the George Washington University in August 2012, celebrated the 10th event in the series. It has been held annually since 2003 at different locations: San Carlos (2011), Bad Honnef (2010), Seoul (2009), Raleigh (2008), Rome (2007), Brookhaven (2006), Swansea (2005), Argonne (2004), and Nara (2003). As usual, it was a very productive and inspiring meeting that brought together experts in the field of finite-temperature QCD, both theoretical and experimental. On the experimental side, we heard about recent results from major experiments, such as PHENIX and STAR at Brookhaven National Laboratory, ALICE and CMS at CERN, and also about the constraints on the QCD phase diagram coming from astronomical observations of one of the largest laboratories one can imagine, neutron stars. The theoretical contributions covered a wide range of topics, including QCD thermodynamics at zero and finite chemical potential, new ideas to overcome the sign problem in the latter case, fluctuations of conserved charges and how they allow one to connect calculations in lattice QCD with experimentally measured quantities, finite-temperature behavior of theories with many flavors of fermions, properties and the fate of heavy quarkonium states in the quark-gluon plasma, and many others. The participants took the time to write up and revise their contributions and submit them for publication in these proceedings. Thanks to their efforts, we have now a good record of the ideas presented and discussed during the workshop. We hope that this will serve both as a reminder and as a reference for the participants and for other researchers interested in the physics of nuclear matter at high temperatures and density. To preserve the atmosphere of the event the contributions are ordered in the same way as the talks at the conference. We are honored to have helped organize the 10th meeting in this series, a milestone that reflects the lasting interest in this research area and the steady progress in resolving the outstanding issues. Many challenges remain and we are confident that this series will continue well into the future. Next year, the meeting will be organized at the Albert Einstein Center for Fundamental Physics at the University of Bern. We expect to have another interesting and lively meeting and look forward to meeting you there. February 23, 2013 Andrei Alexandru Alexei Bazavov Keh-Fei Liu 36th International Conference on High Energy Physics NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) The Australian particle physics community was honoured to host the 36th ICHEP conference in 2012 in Melbourne. This conference has long been the reference event for our international community. The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was a major highlight, with huge international press coverage. ICHEP2012 was described by CERN Director-General, Professor Rolf Heuer, as a landmark conference for our field. In additional to the Higgs announcement, important results from neutrino physics, from flavour physics, and from physics beyond the standard model also provided great interest. There were also updates on key accelerator developments such as the new B-factories, plans for the LHC upgrade, neutrino facilities and associated detector developments. ICHEP2012 exceeded the promise expected of the key conference for our field, and really did provide a reference point for the future.

Formento; Haddad, F.; Sounalet, T.; Stora, T.; Zahi, I. A new facility, named CERN-MEDICIS, is under construction at CERN to produce radionuclides for medical applications. In parallel, the MEDICIS-PROMED, a Marie Sklodowska-Curie innovative training network of the Horizon 2020 European Commission's program, is being coordinated by CERN to train young scientists on the production and use of innovative radionuclides and develop a network of experts within Europe. One program within MEDICIS-PROMED is to determine the feasibility of producing innovative radioisotopes for theranostics using a commercial middle-sized high-current cyclotron and the mass separation technology developed at CERN-MEDICIS. This will allow the production of high specific activity radioisotopes not achievable with the common post-processing by chemical separation. Radioisotopes of scandium, copper, arsenic and terbium have been identified. Preliminary studies of activation yield and irradiation parameters optimization for the production of Tb-149 will be described.

We have designed the laboratories to be taken accompanying a reformed course in the student's second year, with calculus, biology, and chemistry as prerequisites. This permits the laboratories to include significant content on physics relevant to cellular scales, from chemical interactions to random motion and charge screening in fluids. One major focus of the laboratories is to introduce the students to research-grade equipment and modern physics analysis tools in contexts relevant to biology, while maintaining the pedagogically valuable open-ended laboratory structure of reformed laboratories. Lab development procedures along with some preliminary student results from these two small test classes are discussed. Asking the next generation: the implementation of pre-university studentsâ ideas about physics laboratory preparation exercises NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Dunnett, K.; Bartlett, P. A. 2018-01-01 It was planned to introduce online pre-laboratory session activities to a first-year undergraduate physics laboratory course to encourage a minimum level of student preparation for experiments outside the laboratory environment. A group of 16 and 17 year old laboratory work-experience students were tasked to define and design a pre-laboratory activity based on experiments that they had been undertaking. This informed the structure, content and aims of the activities introduced to a first year physics undergraduate laboratory course, with the particular focus on practising the data handling. An implementation study showed how students could try to optimise high grades, rather than gain efficiency-enhancing experience if careful controls were not put in place by assessors. However, the work demonstrated that pre-university and first-year physics students can take an active role in developing scaffolding activities that can help to improve the performance of those that follow their footsteps.

PubMed Honda, Takayuki; Tozuka, Minoru 2015-09-01 In the reversed clinicopathological conference (R-CPC), three specialists in laboratory medicine interpreted routine laboratory data independently in order to understand the detailed state of a patient. R-CPC is an educational method to use laboratory data appropriately, and it is also important to select differential diagnoses in a process of clinical reasoning in addition to the present illness and physical examination. Routine laboratory tests can be performed repeatedly at a relatively low cost, and their time-series analysis can be performed. Interpretation of routine laboratory data is almost the same as taking physical findings. General findings are initially checked and then the state of each organ is examined. Although routine laboratory tests cost little, we can gain much more information from them about the patient than physical examinations.

Researchers are now applying it to science education in an attempt to bring studentsâ science activities closer to authentic science activities. The present study synthesizes the research to discuss the development of technology-enhanced laboratories and how technology may contribute to fulfilling the instructional objectives of laboratories in physics. To be more specific, this paper discusses the engagement of technology to innovate physics laboratories and the potential of technology to promote inquiry, instructor and peer interaction, and learning outcomes. We then construct a framework for teachers, scientists, and programmers to guide and evaluate technology-integrated laboratories. The framework includes inquiry learning and openness supported by technology, ways of conducting laboratories, and the diverse learning objectives on which a technology-integrated laboratory may be focused. « 21 22 23 24 25 » Some links on this page may take you to non-federal websites.
