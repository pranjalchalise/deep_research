Yonhap This week, President Lee Jae Myung said that racism and disinformation pose a grave threat to democracy, directing the justice minister to revise laws regulating defamation so that violators can face harsher punishment. “There are people in our society who constantly engage in discrimination based on race and background, and their hatred and extremism have deepened social unrest,” Lee said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. He singled out political banners as a source of the problem, saying some contain “trashy phrases” that amount to little more than slurs and contempt. Lee expressed frustration that such banners cannot be removed, as those set up by political parties are protected under current law. “Political parties can put up banners whenever and wherever they want. It’s time to rethink such a law because it does more harm than good,” he said, directing Cabinet ministers to draft legislation to restrict political banners. Lee did not specify which phrases he found problematic. Political banners are ubiquitous across the country, with some carrying accusations against China and the Chinese Communist Party over alleged interference in Korean politics. Others target Lee’s confidant, Kim Hyun-ji, who serves as secretary to the first lady’s office. Kim, a longtime aide who has worked with Lee for over a decade, is known to be one of his most trusted advisors. Lee’s criticism of hatred and extremism is well-founded. As he noted, political banners are often divisive and radical, with opposition parties using them to inflame public sentiment against Lee and others. Divisive slogans and partisan interests pursued at the expense of public welfare have long been chronic problems in Korean politics. Hatred, racism and extremism must indeed be curbed. However, the timing of Lee’s criticism raises questions, as the nation grapples with a deteriorating economy and heightened political tensions. The Korean economy is reeling from the impact of the Donald Trump administration’s tariffs, while the depreciation of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar has added further pressure. Exporters, including automakers and semiconductor producers, are suffering from the delayed implementation of the Korea-U.S. tariff deal, as both sides are still negotiating the final joint fact sheet. Compounding the challenges, the country faces political instability as the administration continues to purge what officials describe as the “debris of the Dec. 3 martial law.” The nation is also embroiled in controversy over the prosecution’s inaction following a district court’s ruling that acquitted the so-called “Gang of Five,” who had been accused of illicitly profiting from a massive 2015 land development project in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, of breach of trust and conflict of interest charges. The case has since evolved into a political scandal, as the acting prosecutor-general hinted that the presidential office and justice ministry may have influenced his decision to instruct the Seoul District Prosecutors’ Office not to appeal the ruling. The Korean public is demanding a convincing explanation from the presidential office on whether Lee or his deputies exerted influence over the prosecution’s unusual decision not to appeal the court ruling. The president himself is not free from the scandal, as he oversaw the controversial land development project when he served as mayor of Seongnam. The timing of Lee’s recent denunciation of political banners as malicious tools that spread hatred and racism — and his vow to eliminate what he called “social ills” — is prompting the public to question his motives, as it coincides with growing public scrutiny of him and his office. Before taking action, Lee should reflect deeply on what is expected of him as a national leader, rather than simply doing what he wishes to do. Are his remarks and actions befitting of a head of state? Does his selective application of justice reflect the integrity required of someone entrusted with statecraft? His reaction suggests a troubling misunderstanding of the presidential role. Notably, Lee has remained silent on the anti-America protests that took place in front of the U.S. Embassy in central Seoul, yet he has repeatedly condemned anti-China rallies, labeling their organizers and participants as racists. Such inconsistency fuels public skepticism about his principles and priorities. Finally, Lee must remember that politics is all about timing. When a leader champions causes that seem irrelevant to the nation’s immediate crises, his rhetoric risks sounding detached from reality. As head of state, Lee must focus on the issues demanding urgent attention — above all, providing clear answers on whether he or his deputies were involved in the prosecution’s decision not to appeal the ruling that cleared five former aides of breach of trust and conflict of interest charges."
