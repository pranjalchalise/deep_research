Primary care doc here: I'm hoping to make a poster for my offices that has poignant facts about osteoporosis, the dangers, and the benefits of treatment. Things that will really catch people's attention. Information has to be evidence-based and have sources I can cite. (For context, I have a primarily 70 yo+ mostly female panel and there is a TON of misinfo they think about osteoporosis. It would be nice to have some basics set out on a poster so I don't have to re-discuss all of it so many times every day.) I have my own rambling thoughts but I figured I'd ask you guys for some succinct attention-getters. Thank you in advance! Edit: evidence-based info is what we need folks! Read more Share"
