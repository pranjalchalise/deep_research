State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application. Import useState To use the useState Hook, we first need to import it into our component. Example: At the top of your component, import the useState Hook. import { useState } from \"react\"; Notice that we are destructuring useState from react as it is a named export. To learn more about destructuring, check out the ES6 Destructuring section . Initialize useState We initialize our state by calling useState in our function component. useState accepts an initial state and returns two values: The current state. A function that updates the state. Example: Initialize state at the top of the function component. import { useState } from \"react\"; function FavoriteColor() { const [color, setColor] = useState(\"red\"); } Notice that again, we are destructuring the returned values from useState . The first value, color , is our current state. The second value, setColor , is the function that is used to update our state. These names are variables that can be named anything you would like. Lastly, we set the initial state to \"red\": useState(\"red\") Read State We can now include our state anywhere in our component. Example: Use the state variable in the rendered component. import { useState } from 'react'; import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; function FavoriteColor() { const [color, setColor] = useState(\"red\"); return <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1> } createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render( <FavoriteColor /> ); Run Example » Update State To update our state, we use our state updater function. Example: Use the state updater function to update the state: <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setColor(\"blue\")} >Blue</button> We should never directly update state. Ex: color = \"blue\" is not allowed. Example: Use a button to update the state: import { useState } from 'react'; import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; function FavoriteColor() { const [color, setColor] = useState(\"red\"); return ( <> <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1> <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setColor(\"blue\")} >Blue</button> </> ) } createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render( <FavoriteColor /> ); Run Example » What Can State Hold? The useState Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these! We could create multiple state Hooks to track individual values. Example: Create multiple state Hooks: import { useState } from 'react'; import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; function MyCar() { const [brand, setBrand] = useState(\"Ford\"); const [model, setModel] = useState(\"Mustang\"); const [year, setYear] = useState(\"1964\"); const [color, setColor] = useState(\"red\"); return ( <> <h1>My {brand}</h1> <p> It is a {color} {model} from {year}. </p> </> ) } createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render( <MyCar /> ); Run Example » Or, we can just use one state and include an object instead! Example: Create a single Hook that holds an object: import { useState } from 'react'; import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; function MyCar() { const [car, setCar] = useState({ brand: \"Ford\", model: \"Mustang\", year: \"1964\", color: \"red\" }); return ( <> <h1>My {car.brand}</h1> <p> It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}. </p> </> ) } createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render( <MyCar /> ); Run Example » Since we are now tracking a single object: car , we need to reference that object when rendering the component. (Ex: car.brand ) Updating Objects and Arrays in State When state is updated, the entire state gets overwritten. What if we only want to update the color of our car? If we only called setCar({color: \"blue\"}) , this would remove the brand, model, and year from our state. We can use the JavaScript spread operator to help us. Example: Use the JavaScript spread operator to update only the color of the car: const updateColor = () => { setCar(previousState => { return { ...previousState, color: \"blue\" } }); } Run Example » Because we need the current value of state, we pass a function into our setCar function. This function receives the previous value. We then return an object, spreading the previousState and overwriting only the color. ❮ Previous Next ❯ ★ +1 Sign in to track progress COLOR PICKER REMOVE ADS PLUS SPACES GET CERTIFIED FOR TEACHERS BOOTCAMPS CONTACT US × Contact Sales If you want to use W3Schools services as an educational institution, team or enterprise, send us an e-mail: sales@w3schools.com Report Error If you want to report an error, or if you want to make a suggestion, send us an e-mail: help@w3schools.com Top Tutorials HTML Tutorial CSS Tutorial JavaScript Tutorial How To Tutorial SQL Tutorial Python Tutorial W3.CSS Tutorial Bootstrap Tutorial PHP Tutorial Java Tutorial C++ Tutorial jQuery Tutorial Top References HTML Reference CSS Reference JavaScript Reference SQL Reference Python Reference W3.CSS Reference Bootstrap Reference PHP Reference HTML Colors Java Reference AngularJS Reference jQuery Reference Top Examples HTML Examples CSS Examples JavaScript Examples How To Examples SQL Examples Python Examples W3.CSS Examples Bootstrap Examples PHP Examples Java Examples XML Examples jQuery Examples Get Certified HTML Certificate CSS Certificate JavaScript Certificate Front End Certificate SQL Certificate Python Certificate PHP Certificate jQuery Certificate Java Certificate C++ Certificate C# Certificate XML Certificate     FORUM ABOUT ACADEMY W3Schools is optimized for learning and training.
