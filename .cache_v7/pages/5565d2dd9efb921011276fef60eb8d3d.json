Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The background shorthand CSS property sets all background style properties at once, such as color, image, origin, size, and repeat method. Try it background: green; background: content-box radial-gradient(crimson, skyblue); background: no-repeat url(\"/shared-assets/images/examples/lizard.png\"); background: left 5% / 15% 60% repeat-x url(\"/shared-assets/images/examples/star.png\"); background: center / contain no-repeat url(\"/shared-assets/images/examples/firefox-logo.svg\"), #eeeeee 35% url(\"/shared-assets/images/examples/lizard.png\"); <section id=\"default-example\"> <div id=\"example-element\"></div> </section> #example-element { min-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; padding: 10%; } Constituent properties This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties: background-attachment background-clip background-color background-image background-origin background-position background-repeat background-size Syntax css /* Using a <background-color> */ background: green; /* Using a <bg-image> and <repeat-style> */ background: url(\"test.jpg\") repeat-y; /* Using a <visual-box> and <'background-color'> */ background: border-box red; /* A single image, centered and scaled */ background: no-repeat center/80% url(\"../img/image.png\"); /* Global values */ background: inherit; background: initial; background: revert; background: revert-layer; background: unset; Values <attachment> See background-attachment . Default: scroll . <visual-box> See background-clip and background-origin . Default: border-box and padding-box respectively. <'background-color'> See background-color . Default: transparent . <bg-image> See background-image . Default: none . <bg-position> See background-position . Default: 0% 0% . <repeat-style> See background-repeat . Default: repeat . <bg-size> See background-size . Default: auto . Description The background shorthand property enables you to declare all CSS background properties in a single declaration. The background lies underneath the content of an element. When you have multiple, comma-separated background values, each is a background layer that is painted on top of the previous layers. The background property is specified as one or more background layers, separated by commas. Each layer may include zero, one, or two <visual-box> components and zero or one <attachment> , <bg-image> , <bg-position> , <bg-size> , and <repeat-style> components. If two <bg-position> , <bg-size> , or <repeat-style> components are specified, the first value is the horizontal value and the second value is the vertical value. If only a single value is set, that value is applied to both dimensions. The <'background-color'> component may only be included in the last background layer specified. Component properties not set in the background shorthand property value declaration are set to their default values. Component property order Because some of the component properties share value types, the order of those component properties within the shorthand is important. The <bg-size> value may only be included immediately after <bg-position> , separated with the / character. For example: 10px 10px / 80% 80% means the background image is 80% as tall and as wide as the element, and will be positioned 10px from the top and 10px from the left of the element's top-left corner. Within the <bg-position> , if both values are lengths, or one is a length and the other is center , the first value refers to the horizontal position and the second value refers to the vertical position. Each background layer can include zero, one, or two <visual-box> values. If only one value is included, it sets both background-origin and background-clip . If two values are present, the first occurrence specifies the background-origin and the second specifies the background-clip value. If no <visual-box> values are present, the background-origin defaults to border-box and the background-clip defaults to padding-box . While there is no order requirement for the other background properties, the following order is recommended for consistency and legibility; remember that none of the values are required: <bg-image> <bg-position> / <bg-size> <repeat-style> <attachment> <bg-clip> <bg-origin> <'background-color'> The following background explicitly sets all the default values in this order: css background: none 0% 0% / auto auto repeat scroll border-box padding-box transparent; The following three lines of CSS are equivalent to the above, even if the order differs: css background: none; background: transparent; background: repeat scroll 0% 0% / auto padding-box border-box none transparent; Image painting order If multiple comma-separated backgrounds are included, they create multiple background layers on top of one another. The first background in the list creates the top layer. If the top layer contains no transparent areas, this is the only layer that will be visible. The last layer is the bottom layer. The background color is always included in this layer. Body background applied to the entire document If the document <html> :root element's computed background-image value is none and its background-color is transparent , the browser will transfer the background styles set on the <body> element onto the :root and treat the <body> as if background: initial were set. In other words, the <html> element gets all the background styles set on the <body> element, and the <body> element's background properties are set to their initial values. Because of this behavior, the specification authors recommend setting your document's background styles in your body style block rather than your html style block. However, it's important to note that using containment disables this behavior. When the contain property is set to anything other than none on either the <html> or <body> element, the background property and any longhand components do not propagate from the <body> element to the root <html> element. Formal definition Initial value as each of the properties of the shorthand: background-image : none background-position : 0% 0% background-size : auto auto background-repeat : repeat background-origin : padding-box background-clip : border-box background-attachment : scroll background-color : transparent Applies to all elements. It also applies to ::first-letter and ::first-line . Inherited no Percentages as each of the properties of the shorthand: background-position : refer to the size of the background positioning area minus size of background image; size refers to the width for horizontal offsets and to the height for vertical offsets background-size : relative to the background positioning area Computed value as each of the properties of the shorthand: background-image : as specified, but with <url> values made absolute background-position : as each of the properties of the shorthand: background-position-x : A list, each item consisting of: an offset given as a combination of an absolute length and a percentage, plus an origin keyword background-position-y : A list, each item consisting of: an offset given as a combination of an absolute length and a percentage, plus an origin keyword background-size : as specified, but with relative lengths converted into absolute lengths background-repeat : a list, each item consisting of two keywords, one per dimension background-origin : as specified background-clip : as specified background-attachment : as specified background-color : computed color Animation type as each of the properties of the shorthand: background-color : a color background-image : discrete background-clip : a repeatable list background-position : a repeatable list background-size : a repeatable list background-repeat : discrete background-attachment : discrete Formal syntax background = <bg-layer> # ? , <final-bg-layer> <bg-layer> = <bg-image> || <bg-position> [ / <bg-size> ] ? || <repeat-style> || <attachment> || <bg-clip> || <visual-box> <final-bg-layer> = <bg-image> || <bg-position> [ / <bg-size> ] ? || <repeat-style> || <attachment> || <bg-clip> || <visual-box> || <'background-color'> <bg-image> = <image> | none <bg-position> = <position> | <position-three> <bg-size> = [ <length-percentage [0,â]> | auto ] {1,2} | cover | contain <repeat-style> = repeat-x | repeat-y | repeat-block | repeat-inline | <repetition> {1,2} <attachment> = scroll | fixed | local <bg-clip> = <visual-box> | [ border-area || text ] <visual-box> = content-box | padding-box | border-box <background-color> = <color> <image> = <url> | <image()> | <image-set()> | <cross-fade()> | <element()> | <gradient> <position> = <position-one> | <position-two> | <position-four> <position-three> = [ left | center | right ] && [ [ top | bottom ] <length-percentage> ] | [ [ left | right ] <length-percentage> ] && [ top | center | bottom ] <length-percentage> = <length> | <percentage> <repetition> = repeat | space | round | no-repeat <image()> = image( <image-tags> ?

This is important primarily for screen readers, as a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey nothing to its users. If the image contains information critical to understanding the page's overall purpose, it is better to describe it semantically in the document.
