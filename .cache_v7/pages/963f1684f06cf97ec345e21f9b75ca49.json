When he died at 63, was he poisoned by his wife or could he have died of natural causes? To many in his time, Emperor Claudius was like a cockroach; whatever upheaval Rome faced—and it certainly faced plenty—he would always be there, skating just under the radar, outliving his cleverer, braver, and more powerful contemporaries. A man like Claudius, they said, would die in infancy or outlive them all. It looked like it was going to be the latter—until it didn’t. Overview: (Note: I apologize for the amount of background info here, but I think it’s necessary to set the stage for the various theories. cough*and I’m not good at editing things down*cough. Skippable if you’re just interested in the direct mystery part) Claudius was born Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus on August 1, 10 BC. Despite his storied pedigree as the nephew of Emperor Tiberius and the step-grandson of Emperor Augustus, Claudius inherited none of the charm or battle prowess of his relatives; instead, he was unattractive, clumsy, coarse, and often in ill-health. His own mother thought him monstrous and considered him the standard for stupidity. According to one story, he was forced to attend a memorial for his deceased father in a heavy cloak so that he would not mar the day with his appearance. Because of his perceived uselessness, he spent much of his life overlooked. But being overlooked gave Claudius time for other pursuits, pursuits that in many ways were just as dangerous: history. One of Claudius’ many faults was his honesty, and Rome was not the place to write honestly about those in power. His family quickly put a stop to his writings, but the damage had been done; now, he was viewed as entirely unsuitable for public office. He was snubbed several times for any sort of position until the reign of Emperor Caligula, when he was appointed co-consul (more because of his deceased father than for his own skills). After the assassination of Caligula by Caligula’s own Praetorian Guard, Claudius was dragged by the Guard from behind a curtain and appointed emperor. Claudius’ strange ascension to the throne followed him for the rest of his life, and made him unpopular in some circles, especially the Senate. But during his reign, he expanded the Roman empire majorly for the first time since Emperor Augustus, settled numerous disputes between provinces, changed the court system, created dozens of public works, and issued numerous edicts and reforms. Claudius faced several attempted coups, but weathered them. His personal life was extraordinarily messy—one historian described his taste in women as “‘nothing short of disastrous”—but, in addition to several female partners, he married four times, each a terrible match. His final wife was Agrippina the Younger, in a mostly political union. She had one son already, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus; today, he is better known as Emperor Nero, of fiddling fame. Things were going well for Claudius and Rome. Then, on October 13, AD 54, Claudius died. Afflictions: Before we discuss the mystery of his death, his illnesses are, in some ways, just as mysterious. Several contemporary historians, such as Suetonius (author of The Twelve Caesars , one of the most important contemporary accounts of Roman history), have described Claudius’ litany of physical and mental faults in detail: weak knees, shakes, a stutter, and confused speech, as well as a tendency to foam at the mouth and drool. His laugh was described as ‘indecent,’ and his voice as ‘[belonging] to no land animal.’ Although some disagree on the extent of these issues (as well as the reliability of Suetonius himself), they’re generally accepted. Many diagnoses for Claudius have also been made, ranging from cerebral palsy to Tourette syndrome. Some have also suggested that many of the severest stories of his ill health might have been excuses by his family to keep him away from official functions; one as 'hideous' and 'deformed' as Claudius would not present the desired image of strength and intelligence. Indeed, once Claudius took the throne, many of these symptoms lessened or even vanished, and he seemed to grow far more intelligent and well-spoken. Why? According to Claudius, he had exaggerated his ailments to protect himself. If this was true, it may have saved his life—in Claudius’ time, there was no occupation so hazardous as being a healthy male candidate for the throne. But it’s hard to know how true this was, as it was certainly a habit of those in power, particularly at this time, to edit history to make themselves look better—something no one would know better than the scholarly Claudius who had been so soundly chastised for truthfulness. Contrasting answers to the veracity of Claudius’ claims have emerged; many ancient historians describe Claudius as crude, with a propensity towards gluttony and the pleasures of the flesh, as well as a great lover of games and gladiatorial events, the bloodier the better. He was also a voracious gambler, to the point of addiction, and he \"[ate] himself to sleep\" often. Even within these depictions, however, there are contradictions; Claudius is painted as trusting, oft-confused, and easily manipulated by women, but also paranoid and cruel. Yet these stand in stark contrast to Claudius’ own writings, which show a dedicated public servant, intelligent and well-read. Now, it seems possible that Claudius' rather stunted social development might be more indicative of an isolated and fearful childhood than a mental deficit. For centuries, the accounts of these historians were believed, but with the rediscovery of some of Claudius’ writings such as his “Letter to the Alexandrians,” which demonstrates his reversal of Caligula’s incendiary policies and belief in the rights of Jews, this perception is changing. but the lack of records from Claudius' reign makes it difficult to obtain an accurate picture; for all we know, perhaps those that survive show his only few good decisions. Death: Now we return to AD 54, and the eve of Claudius’ death. The only directly contemporary account is from Seneca’s Apocolocyntosis , written later that year. Although it is a satiric account, it indicates that the fatal illness happened suddenly, around noon of October 13, with death occurring an hour later ( note: Seneca immortalized Claudius’ passing with the poetic lines “This was the last utterance of his to be heard among men, after he let out a sound from that part with which he found it easier to communicate, ‘Oh I think I have sh*t myself” I totally recommend reading all of it, it’s gold). Alternatively, according to Tacitus, some time—possibly days—passed, as Claudius lay ill and \"covered with blankets and poultices.\" Other accounts, including Suetonius's, suggest two separate illnesses, or a recovery then relapse. Suetonius himself points out the many contradictory accounts. But what killed Claudius? Poison(ed?) Mushrooms - According to almost every ancient historian—including all the hits like Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio—Claudius died from poison (or poisoned) mushrooms, which forms an interesting parallel to the likely apocryphal death of his step-grandfather Emperor Augustus from poisoned figs. The alleged perpetrator was his wife, Agrippina the Elder, who wanted to ensure that her son would succeed the throne instead of Claudius’, and thus fed him poison during a meal, his death thus being \"rather than due to her good luck.\" As Cassius Dio has it, Claudius was drunk (as he claims Claudius often was), making this poisoning quite easy. After Claudius’ death, the new Emperor Nero is confirmed to have also had all of Claudius’ blood-related children killed, and also once said that his step-father perished after eating \"the food of the gods,\" that being mushrooms. If this theory is correct, the oft-repeated suspect is A. phalloides or death cap (even today, it is responsible for 95% or mushroom-related deaths in Europe). As some have pointed out, these mushrooms take about 10-15 hours to act, which is inconsistent with Seneca’s account of the death, as well as Tacitus and Cassius Dio’s, though it would match with Suetonius’, as it results in a period of 'recovery' then relapse. Claudius also died during peak death cap season. Another possible culprit is Coprimus atramentarius , which, when consumed with alcohol, causes vomiting and death. Alternatively, some believe that Claudius did die after consuming poison mushrooms, but that it was an accident rather than murder, as he was famously fond of them. The apparent recovery and relapse suggested by some accounts would have signaled foul play immediately to the Romans, who only connected naturally poisonous mushrooms with death in the case of immediate deaths. However, even if Claudius was killed by poison mushrooms as opposed to poisoned ones, it could still have been murder. Interestingly, Claudius was also known for his love of snacks, and ate often during the day—this could have provided someone other than the usual suspects with the opportunity to poison him. I'm not intimately familiar with how taste-testers worked, so I don't know if someone would have tested all his snacks to make sure they were safe. After Claudius' death, his will was not read; some have pointed to this as an example of Agrippina attempting to ensure the throne was secure for her son. Other Poison - Tacitus and several other historians have referenced other potential methods of poison, such as a poison-dipped feather placed in Claudius’ mouth, possibly after a first dose of poison at mealtime was unsuccessful. According to this theory, Claudius’ doctor, Xenophon, was paid by Agrippina to kill Claudius with the feather while performing a medical check-up. It is more likely, though, that Xenophon used a feather to check the reflexes of the already dying Claudius after he’d already been poisoned or fell ill. Xenophon had been Claudius’ doctor for some time, and was richly rewarded for it; he would have had little reason to murder Claudius. Some historians have also pointed to Roman bias against Greek physicians in the stories of Xenophon's condemnation. Natural causes - Originally dismissed, this theory has gained popularity in recent years. Many modern historians now think that Agrippina was villainized unfairly because of Nero’s disastrous reign, and that she had nothing to do with Claudius’ death. This is supported by several factors. First, at the meal where Claudius was supposedly poisoned, the guests noticed nothing wrong. In addition, as Emperor, Claudius had a food-tester. This food-tester, Halotus, continued working—very publicly—as a tester under Nero; if he had been an accomplice to a poisoning—and a poisoning could not have happened at that meal if he was not an accomplice, as he tested all the Emperor’s food—why was he not hidden away as a witness or accomplice, especially by the notoriously ruthless Nero? Instead, many historians now believe Claudius died of an illness or age. A few years earlier, in 52 AD, he had suffered a serious illness and nearly died. Interestingly, coins issued from this point until his death show that he had changed physically, his body thinning shoulders narrowing. He also led a very unhealthy lifestyle full of drink and rich foods. Before the advent of modern medicine, it’s not a recipe for long life, especially for one as sickly as Claudius. Additionally, some have pointed to the difficulty of poisoning mushrooms; the Roman style was to cook them in olive oil or wine, which would have poisoned all who consumed it unless the poison was carefully administered. Final Thoughts & Questions: I’ve always been interested in Claudius’ death partially because of the near-universal blame cast on Agrippina; it bears a lot of resemblance to the treatment other women of the time received, like Livia, Emperor Augustus’ wife, and Messalina, Claudius’ third wife. The unreliability and general incompleteness of most historical records from the time also presents a fascinating challenge in determining how Claudius died, and really, who Claudius was. Sadly, as with a lot of ancient history, there’s a lot we’ll have to content ourselves with not knowing. How unwell was Claudius, mentally or physically? To what extent did he conceal his true state? What was his true personality? How did Claudius die? Did Agrippina have anything to do with it, or was it of natural causes? How might the political situation in Rome before and after Claudius’ death have affected his reputation and the reputations of his alleged murderers?
