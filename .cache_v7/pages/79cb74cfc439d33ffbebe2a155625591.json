Prior to the latest Edge update the text next to the picture was the profile name. Now they all say 'Work' and not all have distinct pictures (indeed I cannot even change the picture from some), which leaving trying to decide which is which. Is there any way to get edge to put the profile name instead of 'Work' (or any other way of me putting some identifiable text there)?

Welcome to Microsoft Community. Regarding to your information I assume that you have some problem of the new profile display. This new feature is related to your Profile type, not your Profile name. Therefore, it can only display two types of profiles: work accounts and personal account. If you do not want to display these, you can go to the website and disable this feature. edge://settings/appearance As for customizing the display name, it seems that Edge currently does not have this feature. After disabling this feature, you can click on this icon and provide feedback for this requirement. If there is anything not clear, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Displaying the type of profile as Work or Personal is fairly useless. It should be displaying the name of the profile. Please sign in to rate this answer.

Unticked the specified toggle (as well as the other one) and my profile icon still says \"Personal\" and has no account picture, despite me being signed in with my Microsoft account.
