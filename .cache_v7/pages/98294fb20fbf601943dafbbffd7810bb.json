Hello my name is Don and I wanted to let you know there have been many complaints and bug files made about this. I would suggest that you see this link https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/news-and-interests-showing-up-and-running-in-task/6df0d17b-897b-4cc1-804c-dc481417d179 for a possible resolution to your problem. Do not try any suggested tricks or work arounds especially with the registry that you may read about as it will not work and could cause you other problems. This problem came from MS Edge and Edge WebView2. Uninstalling Edge WebView 2 will cause problems with other Apps that depend on it. Respectfully, Please sign in to rate this answer.

I saw that information in a news letter (ISSUE 21.42 â¢ 2024-10-14) from Ask Woody, which is usually a very accurate source. He mentions KB5044273 as the apparent source of the problem. https://www.askwoody.com/ I get their detailed news letter by subscription. I don't see this item in the free version so can't give you a link. Please sign in to rate this answer.

Googling this topic returned 1 maybe 2 mentions and not your link. For people curious, this is when my problem with News and Interests began appearing 3 days ago (11/1/24): Servicing Stack 10.0.19041.4950 Update for Microsoft Windows (KB5045933) Security Update for Microsoft Windows (KB5044273) Please sign in to rate this answer.
