While there is a variety of styles and iconography in the art form, the methods and conventions for creating such work are often highly defined and scriptural. The team identified and explored themes that serve as the discourse analysis of Thangka art in the first quarter of the 21st century. They crafted a paper titled “The Intersection of Tradition and Modernity in Thangka painting: Discourse Analysis” to understand the perspectives of artists, art sellers, galleries, and buyers in this field during the course of eight weeks at Incubate Nepal.

It has enabled me to learn my first real research project on Nepal's financial status and my personal growth. One of the most valuable impressions Incubate Nepal has left on me is that one should not strive for perfection; instead, being honest, authentic, and dedicated is sufficient. Learning hard skills, soft skills, and diversity have all had a significant impact on my way of seeing things. Everyone in the Incubate Nepal Family is so welcoming and full of life experiences. My mentor, Anamika didi, and my teammates have been so supportive that they have always made time to sit down and teach me in a variety of ways, whether in research or in life. I will be eternally thankful to this family for providing me with a life-changing experience, a lifelong connection, and the urge to do more.” 2021 Show more Bikash Agrawal Team Samsad ( 2021 ) “Before entering Incubate Nepal, I didn't know anything about research except its spelling. And to my fortune, I got to learn from the dust. The most important thing I learned in IN was to ask questions that helped in better understanding a subject. The processes of data collection and analysis of that data was also a new thing to me. I was blessed with such a wonderful team that 10 weeks seemed like 10 days. The philosophy of Incubate Nepal which is project-based learning was so helpful because it taught us many things without having any pressure to actually prove ourselves in any form of standardized test. 2021 Show more P Aryan Yadav Team Tumornators ( 2021 ) “For me, Incubate Nepal was a tremendous opportunity, giving me the first real touch of innovative world of science! I learnt how to deep dive on any subject matter of my interest by setting up conceptual & analytical framework of mind ultimately to extract impactful solutions. From getting guidance of such kind & accomplished mentors to building strong connections with true exposure, I got everything to initiate shaping myself as a next generation changemaker, which I will cherish forever! I wanna salute the entire family for everything. If I need to rate it, it's surely ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Lastly, one message to the aspiring students, while going through the application try to picturize the real you because it is sth that will truly help getting in! 2021 Show more Abhishek Karna Team Suryastra ( 2021 ) “At Incubate Nepal, I was mindboggled by the surrealistic environment of interdisciplinary collaboration and networking, and that was the best part of my experience. Coming from outside the valley, I had a very limited space with peers of similar interests but here, I found it all: an incredible research mentor, extremely efficient peers, and a wholesome, tough but worthy, experience. I finally found a place I'd fit in as a geeky yet social learner. If you want to cherish and bloom your intellectual eccentricity with fellow eccentrics, Incubate Nepal is just the perfect opportunity to start. 2021 Show more Kripa Lamichhane Art Hub Nepal ( 2021 ) “Incubate Nepal is a platform that every single being thinks of joining to see their capabilities of working as a team. It’s more than just 10 weeks you are going to spend with your mates. More like you working with people of same energies and vibes to build something and in this reaction you get life long friends as by-product. For me, Incubate Nepal has been turning point which made my mind clear and sharp on what I want to pursue. So to upcoming ones, I just want to tell you to be prepared for the knowledge, skills and love that you are gonna be showered with :) 2021 Show more Raghav Raj Sah Art Hub Nepal ( 2021 ) “Strangers have magically transformed into someone precious. The entire journey seems like a beautiful dream worth reliving. Incubate Nepal has transformed me into a different person, and I’m so proud of it, so proud of all of my teammates. It allowed me to look inside the hidden gems of Mithila Art and other arts across the nation. 2021 Show more Riya Jha Team Sathi ( 2021 ) “I had worked on multiple projects before, but working with Incubate Nepal was something really different and amazing. We started off by setting goals and then created plans to achieve the milestones. The best part was the teamwork we had to solve any significant issues and yes the mentorship that we got here was life altering.This was probably the best experience I ever had. And now that slots for the next iteration are open, this is your chance to build connections and work on real life problems with the best mentors. Be Yourself, know your strengths and flaws, and just give your best. 2021 Show more Ayusha Shrestha Team Swasthya Samata ( 2021 ) “It is not always necessary to work on the project from the fields that you are aware of. Working on the topics that are out of your comfort zone can lead you to new path, explore and analyze them strengthening your vision of the world. Although the 10- week with team mates goes by so quick, the learning you learn together and from one another remains with you. 2021 Show more Kritika Pandit Team Tumornators ( 2021 ) “In these 10 weeks, the learning and exploration was an enriching experience, but for me, it were the lifetime bonds developed in such a short timeframe. When I tell someone about our project, they immediately laugh at me. Yeah, a group of teens working on a research paper to cure cancer does sound like a storyline for a movie! Although the journey was overwhelming, with collaborative effort (and well late night discord music sessions!), we really achieved wonders. To clear your confusions, we didn't actually cure cancer, but explored the relevance of few proteins in cancer through molecular docking and binding ratio analysis.` 2021 Show more Satyam Adhikari Team Swasthya Samata ( 2021 ) “Every minute of my involvement in Incubate Nepal was fruitful and exciting. Working side by side with my team members under the supervision and leadership of my mentor taught me not just teamwork and time management skills, but also a lot about health economics that I had never heard of before. It undoubtedly aided me greatly in establishing a solid foundation for future research pursuits. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with my incredible teammates and brilliant mentor for ten weeks.` 2021 Show more Sanskriti Giri Team Dravya ( 2021 ) “Incubate Nepal was without a doubt one of the most valuable learning opportunities I've ever had. It provided me with a platform to connect with other people who shared my desire to bring a `change`. As a member of Team Dravya, I conducted research on Nepal's financial situation, and thanks to my supportive mentor and teammates, I was never discouraged from diving into the world of research as a novice. What started out as an eight-week project gradually grew into a large family. Although I've gained a variety of skills through Incubate Nepal, nothing will ever be as valuable as the lifelong connections I've formed with this family.” 2021 Show more Aayusha Dhungana Team Samsad ( 2021 ) “Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.” 2021 Show more Pranjal Chalise Team Kisan, Team Drishti ( 2020 ) “A surreal utopia where friends turned into F.R.I.E.N.D.S, and fanatics into professionals. Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.” 2020 Show more Anupa Khanal Team Brahmanda ( 2020 ) “Incubate Nepal gave me the opportunity to learn things in a way I never did before. I learned to research, visualize data and more importantly convey and explain my ideas to others. The best part of the program was everyone; be it the mentors or the student themselves motivated each other to do more. It is so much more than just a program and I'm blessed to be a part of this wonderful family!” 2020 Show more Aarasi Shrestha Team Arthasastra ( 2020 ) “Incubate Nepal provided students like me with a platform to share our knowledge on a wide range of topics, hone our leadership skills and team spirit, and it acted as a stepping stone towards accomplishing our future goals and ambitions. Being a team member of ‘Team Arthasastra,' my teammates and I prepared an empirical Economics research paper. Last-minute virtual meetings to complete the tasks that we were assigned, late nights of watching YouTube videos and reading articles on econometrics, and listening to the amazing weekly presentations from different groups helped me in more ways than I thought it would.” 2020 Show more Mahesh Yadav Team Brahmanda ( 2020 ) For me, Incubate Nepal was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I will cherish it all my life. For the first time in my life, I learned teamwork, communication skills, presentation skills, and real-life problem-solving skills at Incubate Nepal. I was always judged and mocked for my suffering communication and presentation skills. Not only did Incubate Nepal accept my flaws, but it also helped me learn and grow those skills. The journey with Incubate Nepal has been a surreal experience for me, and I am grateful to the organizing committee for organizing such a life-changing program.” 2020 Show more Aayushka Budhathoki Team Drishti ( 2020 ) “Incubate Nepal was so much more than I thought. I was able to work with absolutely amazing mentors and meet brilliant people with interests very similar and vastly different from mine. Most importantly it provided me the inspiration that even as a high school student, I can make a difference and use my skills for a social cause. If you're not applying to Incubate Nepal 2021, you are seriously missing out on so much!” 2020 Show more Kiran Yojan Team Diabeters ( 2020 ) “The first step in solving a real world problem is to understand it. Through Incubate Nepal I was able to learn about many real-world issues and also find a promising solution to it. I worked on a biotech project to develop a diabetes monitoring device. This was an incredible opportunity to learn what it takes to create a medical test device. I was able to enhance my critical thinking and research skills while learning the importance of teamwork through this project. With such mentoring and collaboration with such diverse and hardworking friends, Incubate Nepal holds the possibility to stop the next pandemic before it starts.” 2020 Show more Benju Baral Team Diabeters ( 2020 ) “Incubate is definitely one of my best and challenging journeys that had a long-lasting and vast impact on my life in just a short period. New questions arose every day and along came tons of ideas and an immense amount of learning. Productivity was at its peak. Most importantly, I got connected with the talented groups of people, made best friends and seniors who supported and guided me whenever I needed them; even after the end of the program.” 2020 Show more Shruti Pokhrel Team Kisan ( 2020 ) “Incubate Nepal was truly an overwhelming experience that paved the way for me to make connections with people whilst developing teamwork and analytical skills. Exposure to open-ended projects under the guidance of some of the highly accomplished mentors to channel our creative stream and collaborate in prototyping an application ‘KISAN' - perhaps the best aspect of the project. It was through this opportunity that I was able to peek into the world beyond and believe in the possibility of the tremendous potential there is for me to learn and work in the near future.” 2020 Show more Shrijan Pandey Team Arthasastra ( 2020 ) “Incubate Nepal showed me the extent of what a bunch of normal high schoolers could do when given the platform and guidance. It helped me acquire a nuanced idea of the importance of research and the active role of good teamwork in making projects successful. I am sure the skill sets that I have learned from Incubate Nepal will give me a head start at college. Also, Ahilya didi rocks.” 2020 Applications for 2022 closed!
