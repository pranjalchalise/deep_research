What have we been up to all these years? How has Amherst and a liberal arts education impacted our lives? What college memories have stayed with us? How are we thinking about the next 20 years? Latest Episode Follow Episodes 5D AGO Sonia Nagorski Reads Earthâs Past To Help Predict And Improve Its Future As a very amateur geologist, I've been looking forward to catching up with Sonia Nagorski ever since my podcast project started. That's because she's a geologist whose work focuses on understanding Earthâs history and what it can tell us about the world we humans are shaping today. Perhaps not surprisingly, she and I share a sense of wonder about the mind-bending qualities of Earth time and the pleasures of connecting to the geology right under our feet. We talk about her two decades living and teaching in Alaska, the sense of community that comes from life at the edge of wilderness, and her recent move to the University of Colorado Boulder. Along the way, Sonia explains how geology provides essential context for understanding topics that go beyond geology, and why learning to notice and name the landscape around us can deepen both curiosity and responsibility. Highlights: Why geology is best understood as history told on Earthâs timescale What living in Alaska taught her about community, resilience, and connection to place Simple ways to build curiosity about the geology all around us The three Amherst classmates she wants me to interview next You can email her at sonianagorski@gmail.com. Also, check out the Rockd app to learn about the geology in your neck of the woods. Big thanks to Deb Thalheimer Long for nominating Sonia. 44 min JAN 20 Mike Gold Makes The Case For Big Swings That Lead To Practical Good Mike Gold has built a life defined by range. He ran an art gallery in New York. He scaled an animation studio to nearly 200 artists. He has built backend systems for massively multiplayer online games, collaborated with DARPA on next-generation engineering tools, and even mined gold on a beach in Nome, Alaska. Mike traces the throughline that unites these pursuits: he loves learning, assembling strong teams, and building systems that improve the human experience. Today that compass points to two long-term missions: helping more children learn to read earlier, and reducing serious sports injuries through a short weekly training regimen that is proven to deliver outsized results. Highlights include: Mining gold in Nome and what it taught him about persistence and problem-solving Why early reading is one of the most studied areas of learning yet still lagging in successful outcomes An introduction to RIIP REPS, a 35 to 40 minute weekly program designed to reduce injuries and improve performance especially for teenage athletes The Amherst classmate he nominates for a future episode You can email Mike at HancockGold@gmail.com. Thanks to Jordan Hayslip for nominating him. 47 min JAN 13 Asim Ahmed Reflects On Caregiving, Infectious Disease Sleuthing, And The Soundtrack Of His Life Asim Ahmed has three passions: the detection and workings of infectious diseases, sports (especially his hometown St. Louis teams), and music, and in this wide-ranging conversation, he shows how each one has shaped his life. We talk about his one-of-a-kind custom jerseys (clever mashups of teams, players, and music references), his journey from pediatric infectious disease (ID) in academic medicine to metagenomic diagnostics in biotech, and the âdetective workâ mindset that drew him to ID in the first place. We also close with something deeply personal: Asim reflects on the reality of caring for aging parents, including how complex the system can be, and why heâs willing to help others who find themselves learning it on the fly. Highlights include: The art (and satire) of his custom sports jerseys Why he was drawn to infectious disease The promise of âliquid biopsyââstyle diagnostics for infections The live shows and venues that he'll never forget The Amherst classmate he wants me to interview next For those not familiar with \"Seven Nations Army\" by the White Stripes, you can listen to it here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2QdDbelmY. You can email Asim at atothe3@gmail.com. Big thanks to JC Leveque for nominating him. 51 min JAN 6 Mariela Rexach Learned To Stop Following The Script Mariela Rexach's life reflects a combination of steadiness, self-knowledge, and humble assertiveness. From Amherst to Penn Law and back home to Puerto Rico, Mariela has raised a family and built a nearly three-decade career at the same women-owned labor and employment law firm. She shares the thinking that has helped her make decisions that align with her values rather than conventional expectations. Mariela reflects on the mentorship of a federal judge she credits with giving her more than any advanced degree ever could. She talks candidly about how fear fuels her courtroom preparation, the recurring discomfort that comes with new challenges, and how she has learned to recognize those feelings as signals that sheâs exactly where she needs to be. Listen carefully and you'll take away so much wisdom, including what it looks like to advocate for yourself, how to shape your work around your life, how to ask for what you need, and the importance of leading with empathy. Highlights Why âgetting comfortable being uncomfortableâ has been one of Marielaâs most valuable skills acquired at Amherst How fear and self-doubt can be harnessed as tools for preparation and excellence Why thereâs no single template for success, and why playing to your strengths is so much more important than playing to expectations The importance of asking for what you need and modeling humane leadership for the next generation Three new classmates she'd like to hear me interview next To get in touch with her, find her on Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn. Big thanks to Alisa Pincus for nominating Mariela! 53 min 12/30/2025 Kensei Nishikawa Champions The Humanities In A Divided World Kensei Nishikawa arrived at Amherst as a transfer student from Japan already holding a degree from the University of Tokyo, carrying with him two languages, two cultures, and a deep love of literature. What he didnât yet know was how profoundly Amherst would shape not just how he reads and writes, but how he listens. We explore Kenseiâs lifelong devotion to the humanities, especially poetry, and the role they have played in his life as both a student and a teacher. Now a professor of English and poetry in Japan, Kensei has spent decades moving between languages and academic traditions, translating words, structures, and ways of thinking. He shares why he believes the humanities remain essential for cultivating empathy, moral imagination, and the ability to hear one another. Kensei also speaks candidly about aging, memory, and the work of maintaining oneâs intellectual vitality over time. Rather than chasing novelty, he is focused on preserving the richness of language and thought. Highlights include: What it meant to arrive at Amherst as an international transfer student in 1992, and how that moment shaped his understanding of America. How Amherst taught him to listen in the classroom, across differences, and in a second language. The challenges and rewards of teaching poetry and literature across Japanese and American academic traditions. Why the humanities matter now more than ever, and how they help us live more human lives. The classmate he hopes to hear from next. To get in touch, you can email Kensei at kenseini@inst.kobe-cufs.ac.jp. Many thanks to Brian Clark for nominating Kensei. 49 min 12/18/2025 Parke Lutter And The Art of Becoming Who You Already Were Amherst isn't known for launching fashion designers and entrepreneurs, but that's just one of the reasons why this conversation with Parke Lutter was so much fun. This talent has been building inside of him since his childhood in the Midwest, where he made clothes for one of us stuffed animals, his friends, and even a prom dress for his sister. Still, Parke hadn't awakened to that interest as a professional possibility when he arrived at Amherst imagining a Wharton-bound career in business. His study abroad in Paris, the friendships he formed, and his own coming-out process helped him understand that his childhood instinct to make things wasnât just a hobby. We also talk about the birth and evolution of Parke & Ronen, the fashion and lifestyle brand he co-founded with his now-husband, and how building a business that has lasted nearly 30 years has required resilience, reinvention, and a willingness to keep learning. Parke shares how his creative process has changed with age and how heâs thinking about the next phase of life, including questions about legacy, freedom, and what work might look like when you finally have the option not to do it. Highlights include: The role Amherst played as a safe, transitional place where Parke learned to think, create, and understand himself more fully. The creative âconstellationsâ Parke builds from travel, culture, mood, and the world around him. What aging has changed about his creative muscle. How heâs thinking about the future: succession, legacy, creativity, and the possibility of a very different rhythm of life. The classmates he wants to hear from next To get in touch, email Parke at parke@parkeandronen.com, and follow Parke & Ronen on social.

From Wall Street to academia, from the Baltimore public schools to the hospital floor, Deb has navigated big career pivots with intentionality. Now a nurse specializing in wound care and infusion therapy, she brings to her patients the same attentiveness she has offered students, colleagues, and friends: an ability to read people gently, listen deeply, and act thoughtfully. The conversation explores how her gift for quiet perception, honed at Amherst through the close reading of texts and refined through her study of literature, theology, and now medicine, has shaped her approach to work, family, and community. Her story is one of continuous learning and service, and of finding profound meaning in small, human acts of compassion. Along the way, she shares lessons sheâs passed on to her two grown sons, both out in the world now, and the two bits of terrific life advice they're most likely to say they hear from their mom. Episode Highlights: How Debâs winding path from finance to French literature to nursing reflects a life lived with intention. The subtle art of listening, and how she uses it to discern both what people say and what they canât quite express. What sheâs learned about compassion from her students, her patients, and her own aging parents. The role Amherst played in teaching her to read closely, not only books, but people. The simple but powerful advice sheâs passed along to her children about integrity and accountability. Plus, she nominates two new classmates to appear in the guest's chair. You can email Deb at DeborahTLong22@gmail.com. 41 min 11/13/2025 Matt Sawyer Has Found His Forever Team Matt Sawyer has built a career rooted in one place: the Williston Northampton School in Easthampton, Mass., where heâs taught English, coached baseball and football, and served as ninth-grade dean for more than three decades. In a world that celebrates mobility and reinvention, Mattâs story is one of steadfastness and the value of deep community attachments. This conversation explores how teaching has changed since the 1990s, why heâs finally stepping away from coaching varsity baseball after 30 seasons, and how much he's looking forward to watching more of his childrenâs college athletics careers instead of leading practices himself. Matt reflects on building strong team culture, the lessons learned from Amherst footballâs ups and downs, and how the classroom can remain a place for curiosity and honest disagreement, even in an age of AI and youthful risk aversion. Highlights include: Longevity with purpose: Matt has spent his entire post-Amherst career at Williston, finding new ways to grow within the same community rather than leaving it. Shaping culture over chasing wins: He believes that strong team culture not only enriches studentsâ lives but often leads to more success on the field. A coachâs evolution: After 30 seasons leading varsity baseball, heâs trading the dugout for the umpireâs mask and embracing a new vantage point on the game. Teaching in the AI era: His English department has gone âold school,â emphasizing pen-and-paper writing and face-to-face discussion as antidotes to digital crutches. Lifelong impact: Inspired by Amherst professors like Barry OâConnell, Matt sees teaching as a way to meet students where they are and help them through lifeâs hardest transitions. A family woven into campus life: Matt and Sarahâs (Class of '97) home, work, and family life intersect daily, making the Williston community an extension of their own. Matt also shares whom he hopes will take the mic next. You can email Matt at msawyer@williston.com or call or text him at 413.695.8370. 53 min See All (75) Ratings & Reviews 5 out of 5 11 Ratings Inspiring real-life stories 11/21/2019 KS1006 Super impressed to hear stories about heroes that you havenât heard about.
