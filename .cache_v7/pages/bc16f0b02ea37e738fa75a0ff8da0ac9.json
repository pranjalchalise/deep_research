(Photo courtesy: Tuoi Tre/ File Photo) The Vietnamese developer behind the mobile phone game Flappy Bird, has announced he will fund student projects worth up to VND200 million (about $A12,200). Nguyen Ha Dong detailed his mission in a Facebook status, stating he was looking to give back to society by providing private funding for student projects in Vietnam and abroad. The 32-year-old Hanoi-based programmer called on people to pitch their ideas, especially in the field of robotics, artificial intelligence, community and education. Nguyen’s game Flappy Bird was released in 2013. It became the most downloaded free mobile game in January 2014, reportedly earning the creator $US50,000 dollars a day from advertisements and sales. But a month later, the creator removed the game from online distributors, claiming he felt guilty for the game’s addictive nature. – TiVi Tuan-san BÀI VIẾT LIÊN QUAN Những bài viết cùng thể loại 13 November, 2020 ‘Unacceptably low’ number of women in top Australian jobs: govt body 13 November, 2020 Australia scraps plans to allow foreign students back 04 November, 2020 Election Day unfolds smoothly, despite fears of disruption 04 November, 2020 Australia’s Crown Resorts unsuitable for Sydney casino licence, inquiry hears 04 November, 2020 Victoria reports no COVID-19 cases for fifth straight day 03 November, 2020 US surpasses 95 million early ballots on eve of Election Day 31 October, 2020 Pompeo wraps up Asia tour in Vietnam following prisoner release 30 October, 2020 Vietnam tackles typhoon’s tragic aftermath as new storm threatens region 27 October, 2020 Trump celebrates at White House as Supreme Court nominee confirmed"
