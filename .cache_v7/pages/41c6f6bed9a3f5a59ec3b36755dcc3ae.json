This Seminar presents an updated approach to osteoporosis consultation, drawing upon published evidence and collaborative expert opinion to place the data in a pragmatic and useful context for clinicians. New evidence on osteoporosis screening recommendations, fracture-risk assessment, intervention decisions, nutrition-based therapies, and antiresorptive and anabolic therapies are discussed, along with practical approaches to treatment in the oldest old, those with chronic kidney disease, and patients who continue to fracture despite therapy. Patient safety is emphasised by providing an overview of advice on safe discontinuation of denosumab in those who require it. Introduction Bone loss and osteoporosis occur commonly with normal ageing, chronic diseases, and off-target drug therapy effects. 1 The technical description of osteoporosis as a state of low bone mass with microarchitectural deterioration includes mention of increased bone fragility and propensity to fracture, 2 often recurrently. 3 Low bone mass is asymptomatic, but osteoporotic fractures are common, 4 costly,5, 6 and often disabling events in the life of an older person. 7 Effective therapies to reduce the risk of such fractures are widely available, but often underused or mistargeted.8, 9 Section snippets Background In many cases, the initial presentation leading to a diagnosis of osteoporosis is the occurrence of a major low-trauma fracture, typically of the wrist, shoulder, pelvis, or hip in postmenopausal women or older men. Vertebral collapse, or compression fracture, is also common, albeit often unrecognised, asymptomatic, or dismissed as a normal age-related x-ray finding. 10 A clinical fracture presentation represents the late-stage manifestation of an otherwise silent and continuous process of Osteoporosis screening Screening recommendations to identify pharmacotherapy candidates among those at risk for future fragility fractures are important elements in all osteoporosis guidelines. 18 Screening can involve only using major clinical risk factors, such as age, sex, and prior fragility fracture, although the addition of BMD, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), improves the risk stratification accuracy. 19 However, effective treatment options are often initiated based on low BMD. 20 Since 2019, Fracture-risk assessment Although the diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis for both men and women is historically based on a BMD threshold T-score of −2·5 SD or lower, most fractures occur in individuals with T-scores above this threshold. 15 Thus, the National Bone Health Alliance Working Group advocated to formally expand the criteria for making a diagnosis of osteoporosis to include the presence of specific low-trauma fractures or the determination of an elevated fracture risk, without a T-score of −2·5 or lower. 41 The shared decision to initiate an antifracture drug therapy Virtually all osteoporosis guidelines include specific criteria or scenarios in which it is recommended to offer or initiate antifracture drug therapy. Most guidelines agree that in an older or osteoporotic patient incident hip or vertebral fractures should be indications for pharmacotherapy intervention, but beyond that, a systematic review of global guidelines showed little agreement.56, 57, 58 Generally, recommendations might be imaging-based (ie, DXA–BMD thresholds), risk tool-based (ie, Vitamin D Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium-phosphate homoeostasis and is necessary for bone growth and maintenance. 82 However, in populations with a low prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, general population screening is not cost-effective and should be reserved for those with risk factors for serious vitamin D deficiency (eg, malnutrition, malabsorption, chronic kidney disease [CKD], and institutionalisation) or evidence of metabolic bone disease. 82 Total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D Factors influencing treatment modality In selecting a treatment modality, osteoporosis severity, as well as patient-specific medical comorbidities, are important considerations. Osteoporosis severity has led to the concept of goal-directed therapy. 98 This approach sets treatment targets, determined according to each patient's individual risk profile, including the recency, site, number, and severity of prior fragility fractures, and the severity of densitometric osteoporosis. The selection of initial treatment modality should Update on denosumab therapy Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that prevents osteoclast-mediated bone resorption via inhibition of receptor activator nuclear factor kappa β ligand (RANK-L) binding to osteoclast-expressed nuclear factor kappa β receptor activator (RANK). After bisphosphonates, denosumab is the second most prescribed osteoporosis therapy. 109 It is also commonly used as part of treatment protocols to reduce bone loss or prevent fractures in selected oncology settings. 110 Several prospective clinical Anabolic versus antiresorptive in fracture risk reduction Anabolic therapies for osteoporosis act by either stimulating the parathyroid hormone receptor-1 (PTHR1; teriparatide and abaloparatide) or via sclerostin inhibition (romosozumab). Studies have shown the superiority of anabolic over antiresorptive therapy for both fracture reduction and increasing BMD. RCTs have shown that over 24–33 months, teriparatide reduces vertebral (HR 0·44, 95% CI 0·29–0·68) and clinical fractures (HR 0·48, 0·32–0·74) compared with risedronate; 120 romosozumab reduces Treatment in the oldest old A common question is whether there is an upper age limit at which antifracture drug therapy is no longer effective or recommended. Arguments against drug therapy include the risks of polypharmacy at older age, 140 the issue of recurrent falls (in which fractures can be independent of BMD), 141 the safety of intervention in view of multiple competing morbidities, and the general recommendation for deprescribing drugs of low value in patients with a short expected lifespan. 142 With respect to Fracture during therapy Although antifracture drug interventions have been shown to reduce the risk of fracture, no intervention can be expected to prevent all future fractures. Active treatment arms in large clinical trials still showed fracture rates of 1–11% within 2–5 years of therapy (table 3),73, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156 despite being effective at reducing risk of fracture compared with no treatment. Therefore, it is inevitable that some patients using antifracture therapy will still sustain a fracture; Care gap and future outlook Many barriers to treatment uptake and adherence exist in osteoporosis. The most important is the identification of patients with fragility fractures in the health-care system, where less than 20% are initiated on pharmacological treatment. Fracture liaison services identify and provide care for patients with a fragility fracture to reduce subsequent fracture risk. Despite proven benefits, implementation of fracture liaison services has been scarce across health-care systems globally. 171 One Declaration of interests CY declares peer-reviewed research grants relating to bone health (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, University Hospital Foundation, and Cancer Research Society) and membership on the Scientific Advisory Council of Osteoporosis Canada.
