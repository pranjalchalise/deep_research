It's a massive subject that's generally ignored because of what happened 40 or so years later with Marius's equally famous/infamous nephew. So who was the principal good guy, and who the bad. As they both used prescriptions on the others followers/supporters. To remove political enemies and to just even scores. This is how Crassis started his journey to massive wealth. By denouncing rich property owners. And Pompey gained his career by siding with Sulla and taking his father Strabo's forces over to Sulla after Strabo's Devine intervention style death ( by lightning) Was Marius wrong to try and hold on to power for so long ? He even had his Son made Consul. And was he wrong to be so petty in his jealousy over Sulla's military career. And the potential for greater victories in the East for both men. Was the famous Marius supporter Q. Sertorius, right or wrong for trying to maintain the status quo in Hispania against the new regime Sulla set up. After the defeat of Marius and later Cinna ? Was Sulla wrong to do what he did ? Stacked the Senate with survivors of his cause. Added more to insure no change. Then created laws to stop his legal persecution and retired soon after. There is so much back and forth, it's hard to follow. Was there an actual good guy ? When such rampant blood letting was being carried out against the elites, and civilian population in general. Ultimately this led to a peace between a Marian supporter Caesar and two Sulla supporters Crassis and Pompey. Which led further into Romes greatness being enhanced and its borders enlarged. But again at great cost and another Civil War. Any opinions or input would be valued. It's a subject I am interested in. And in history we usually ascribe the bad guy role to the loser. But although I am not a fan of the vain Marius. I see him as upholding Romes interests. And Sulla being the revolutionary upstart who won. Read more Share"
