It varies from other SDF libraries in the following ways: CPU-only, can be run single-threaded or multi-threaded for some integrators Support for multiple different layer types (containing different types of voxels) Serialization using protobufs Different ways of handling weighting during merging Different ways of inserting pose information about scans Tight ROS integration (in voxblox_ros package) Easily extensible with whatever integrators you want Features an implementation of building Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs, EDTs) directly from TSDFs.
