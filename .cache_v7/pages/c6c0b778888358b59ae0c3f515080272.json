Comment Name Email Website Δ Zero on January 29, 2026 3:46 pm From the same guy who did the two great Sisu films, this Rambo prequel won’t disappoint and it will surprise, to the point it could be one of the best of the franchise. Can’t wait to see it next year. Reply Reply to Zero Anonymous on January 29, 2026 2:33 pm How do you make Rambo film without Stallone? Just won’t be the same. Reply Reply to Anonymous Anonymous on January 29, 2026 3:43 pm This is a prequel. Stallone is too old for that and we all know how bad digital de-aging looks. Reply Reply to Anonymous Guest777 on January 29, 2026 6:35 pm So what? Stallone might appear as an older version of Rambo in flashforward and narration scenes. No AI needed at all. It might easily be both a prequel and a mini-continuation at the same time. Reply Reply to Guest777 Ian Wall on January 29, 2026 2:31 pm Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmyk. Those are names I haven’t heard in a long, long time… Reply Reply to Ian Wall Sidebar"
