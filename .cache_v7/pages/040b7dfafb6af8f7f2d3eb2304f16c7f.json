The government aims to make India a global leader in services, targeting a 10% share in the global services market by 2047 through this initiative. From building campuses to building outcomes Last yearâs allocation of about â¹1.28 lakh crore to the Ministry of Education, up 6.22 per cent from the previous year, reinforced the governmentâs commitment to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Schools received their highest-ever funding, with increased support for Samagra Shiksha, PM-POSHAN, and PM-SHRI Schools. BharatNet began extending broadband to government secondary schools, while digital textbooks in Indian languages under the Bharatiya Bhasha Pustak Scheme aimed to make learning more inclusive. Higher education continued its expansion. Five IITs set up after 2014 received infrastructure upgrades, 6,500 new seats were added, and IIT Patna was earmarked for major development. The PM Research Fellowship expanded support for 10,000 scholars at IITs and IISc. A â¹500-crore Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence for Education signalled a first step towards AI-enabled teaching. Medical education was also being revitalized with an increase of 10,000 seats this year as part of a more long term goal of 75,000 seats in five years. The scaffolds are being erected. The question to be asked is whether Budget 2026 will turn radically towards the quality of learning, teacher preparedness, and employability. The NEP 2020 is progressive, although the difficult task will be the future. According to the Economic Survey 2025-26, education was outlined as the core part of the growth process in India, with an increase in enrolment and increased career opportunities. The current Gross Enrolment Ratios are 90.9 on the primary level and 90.3 on upper primary level. Today India has 23 IITs, 21 IIMs, and 20 AIIMS, with international IIT campuses in Zanzibar and Abu Dhabi. The Academic Bank of Credit has 2,660 institutions, whose IDs have been issued to over 4.6 crore individuals, giving them the option of entering and leaving freely. Approximately 153 universities have implemented bi-annual admissions, which has facilitated the objective of NEP, which aims at achieving 50 percent higher education GER by 2035. But NEP 2020 was not all about numbers. It has real potential in multidisciplinary learning, quality teachers, and education that is industry oriented. Those hopes require low interest in the training of the faculty and reforming the curriculum and assessment systems, aspects that hardly find their place in the headlines but ultimately come back to haunt. With the development of AI, jobs become anxious What is more important, a greater discomfort is spreading among students: What will artificial intelligence do to their careers? Entry-level jobs in IT, services, and media are already being automated. At the same time, new opportunities are emerging in data, design, ethics, and humanâAI collaboration. The challenge for India is not resisting technology but preparing young people to work alongside it. Last yearâs AI Centre of Excellence was an important signal. Education leaders now hope that Budget 2026 can go a step further, including supporting scale of teacher training, installing AI literacy in schools and inspiring universities to develop programmes with industry. In the absence of this change, India would have the risk of graduating students with degrees who are not directing in the rapidly evolving job market. Skills, teachers and employability gap The shift in the government towards skill-based education, which has been seen through five National Centres of Excellence in Skilling, has demonstrated the increasing concern over the workforce preparation. However, there is still a gap between theoretical education and the requirements of the workplace, particularly beyond the best-of-the-best schools. The stakeholders expect Budget 2026 to provide greater backing to apprenticeships, micro-credentials, and regional skill hubs. Another priority is teacher capacity-building. Education reform cannot move faster than the educators who deliver it. There is also rising demand for better-targeted funding for digital infrastructure and higher education financing, as India positions itself as a global talent supplier. A defining moment for Indiaâs education future Education funding has grown steadily. Now comes the more difficult phase: translating expenditure into impact. Budget 2026â27 arrives at a moment when Indiaâs demographic advantage is still intact, but not guaranteed. If todayâs announcements successfully link NEP 2020 with AI readiness, teacher development, and real-world skills, this Budget could shape the countryâs workforce for decades.
