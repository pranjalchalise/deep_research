In the leaked audio, Kirk can be heard giggling and talking about the TPUSA event organised after the slain right-wing political activist's assassination, appreciating merch sales and staff support in the organisation of the memorial. While Kirk has been transitioning into the role of a tragedy-stricken widow, rising as a Republican promoter and organiser, Owens has been warning of raising the curtains off the carefully curated show. Charlie Kirkâs Old Post Criticizing âHating Trumpâ Resurfaces Amid Minneapolis Shooting Fallout Candace Owen's buzzing leaked video On her YouTube channel with 5.75M subscribers, Owens shared a video titled 'Erika Kirk's Upbeat TPUSA Call Less Than Two Weeks After Charlie Kirk's Assassination'. She pointed out the timing of the call, saying, \"I want to remind you that Charlie has not been dead for two weeks.\" She also marked how the \"obvious point of the call was to introduce Erika Kirk as the new leader.\" \"Hi everybody, I still love these emojis, Zoom, haha, things. I don't even know where to begin, the fact that we were able to pull off an event of the century. Like it's just insane,\" said Erika. She shared how the \"stadium overflowed\" with over 275,000 people and over 200,000 merch sales had been achieved. She went on to thank the teams involved in the organisation of the event. \"I want to thank the events team, the development team, the graphic design team, the production team,\" she said pointing out that the staff who had worked on the memorial had \"20-hour days for a week during the time of us grieving the loss of my husband.\" Candace Owens LEAKS Erika Kirkâs 'UPBEAT TPUSA CALL' Post Charlie Kirkâs Death After calling the employees \"breathing angels\" she suddenly transitioned into a rant on the alleged existence of a beef between the employees. \"I don't care if any of you have beef with each other from the past or have issues with someone said something about this or that, please put it to rest.\" \"My husband's dead, like I'm not trying to be morbid but he's dead, and it puts life into perspective of how short it is,\" she ended. This is a broader part of the attack Owens has launched against the new TPUSA leader. In additional posts, she alleged that the employees were questioned about their loyalty to Kirk and asked about private conversations regarding leadership. At the time of writing, TPUSA had not confirmed or denied these allegations. The event Kirk seems to be mentioning is her husband's memorial service held on September 21, 2025, at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale. Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA when he was 18, was shot at an event on a Utah university campus on September 10. Post that, his wife has taken over as the chairwoman and CEO of the organisation.
