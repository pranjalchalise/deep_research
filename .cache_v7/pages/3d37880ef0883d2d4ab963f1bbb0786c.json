My transcript is 10 years long and over 130 credits, but I don’t even have an associates degree because I’ve never been enrolled long enough to finish a program. For context, I have a chronic illness that has forced me to withdraw in the middle of a semester and because of this, my transcript is all over the place (all A’s one semester then all F’s the next one). I am currently attending Salem State, but they don’t have my wife’s program and Amherst does. Amherst has family housing which I can’t find anywhere else in nearly the whole state. And to be honest I’m just sick of living in Salem. I know that some schools are super helpful for non-trad students, and some they are just kinda swept under the rug. Here, I feel swept under the rug. Any insights on Amherst as a non trad would be appreciated! Read more Share"
