Left Center Right Ground G Logo Light Bias Comparison Ground G Logo Bias Comparison A team at SLAC decoded the lost star catalog of Hipparchus using a synchrotron, revealing previously invisible Greek texts, including the word for 'Aquarius.' The scanning relied on X-ray fluorescence technology , enhancing resolution beyond previous imaging methods to separate layers of ink from different eras. Researchers aim to compare new data with preserved records of Ptolemy to prove he did not plagiarize Hipparchus's work, as indicated by researcher Victor Gysembergh. The findings may resolve debates about the work of astronomer Ptolemy, indicating he utilized sources other than Hipparchus, according to historian Bradley Schaefer.
