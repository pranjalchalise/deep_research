The biweekly show, which explores how emerging technologies reshape how we live, work, and connect, surpassed 16,000 downloads within 30 days of its first full episode, with its pilot episode alone drawing more than 6,000 listeners. \"The response has been overwhelming,\" said Perry. \"Technology is moving faster than most people can keep up with, and that gap creates confusion and fear. This show is about slowing down, asking better questions, and helping people see what's really changing and what's not in the tech shaping our world. Clearly, that message is resonating.\" A Strong Start Thoughts on Tech & Things premiered with a pilot episode on September 25, 2025, followed by its first full episode on October 16, 2025. In just three months, the show has established itself as a destination for curious listeners navigating a fast-changing technological landscape. Episodes have tackled topics including the data center boom reshaping Maryland's infrastructure, Google's shifting search landscape, how Baltimore City Public Schools are preparing students for AI, whether smart glasses will replace smartphones, and the emerging space economy. A special edition episode produced in partnership with the World Trade Center Institute explored the promise and reality of quantum computing. New episodes are available every two weeks on WYPR.org, jasonmperry.com, the WYPR app, and all major podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and NPR. CES 2026 Coverage This month, Perry brings Thoughts on Tech & Things to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Coverage will include a live interview on WYPR's flagship program, Midday , and a special edition podcast breaking down the biggest announcements and trends from the world's largest technology conference. What's Ahead Upcoming episodes will explore how AI is rewriting the job market, whether hackers target computers or people, and how emerging technologies are or aren't serving people with disabilities. The show continues to pair sharp insights with accessible storytelling, featuring in-depth conversations with innovators, researchers, and creative thinkers.
