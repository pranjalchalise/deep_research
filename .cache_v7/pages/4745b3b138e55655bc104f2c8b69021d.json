(Show more) Sam Altman (born April 22, 1985, Chicago , Illinois , U.S.) is an American entrepreneur who was president of the start-up accelerator Y Combinator from 2014 to 2019 and chief executive officer (CEO) of the artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI beginning in 2019. He has been compared to tech visionaries, including Steve Jobs and Bill Gates , and is known for his belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be able to do anything that humans can. Early life Sam Altman was born in Chicago and moved as a young boy to the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri. He showed an aptitude for numbers and computing at an early age. He knew he was gay but did not come out to his parents until he was a teenager. “Growing up gay in the Midwest in the 2000s was not the most awesome thing,” he said in a New Yorker interview in 2016. He attended John Burroughs , a elite prep school , where he announced to a school assembly that he was gay and encouraged teachers to post “Safe Space” placards in their classrooms in support of gay students. “What Sam did changed the school,” Altman’s college counselor said later in The New Yorker . Loopt and Y Combinator Altman attended Stanford University , where he studied computer science . He dropped out after two years, saying later that he had learned more playing poker with classmates than he had attending lectures by professors. He told The New York Times in 2023 that poker taught him “how to notice patterns in people over time, how to make decisions with very imperfect information….It’s a great game.” In 2005, after leaving Stanford, he founded Loopt, an app that allowed users to share their location with friends. Loopt was one of the first companies to receive funding from start-up accelerator Y Combinator. Although Loopt attracted partnerships with wireless carriers such as Sprint, it failed to attract users, and in 2012 it was acquired by the banking company Green Dot for $43 million. In 2011 Altman began working part-time as a partner at Y Combinator, and the next year he founded the venture fund Hydrazine Capital with his brother Max Altman. Y Combinator founders Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston asked Sam Altman to succeed Graham as president, and he accepted the position in 2014. Under Altman, Y Combinator cemented its reputation as the premier place for start-up founders to learn to build a successful company. Y Combinator assembles founders twice a year for a three-month program during which they learn how to turn their ideas into a useful business. Y Combinator also provides founders with $500,000 in funding in exchange for equity in their companies. By the time Altman stepped down as president in 2019, Y Combinator had helped about 1,900 companies, among them the room-rental service Airbnb, the delivery companies Instacart and DoorDash, the forum site Reddit , and the streaming platform Twitch . OpenAI: ChatGPT and turmoil In 2015 OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit organization to develop AI for the benefit of humanity. Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk were cochairs of the organization. OpenAI started with $1 billion in funding provided by Altman, Musk, American entrepreneur Peter Thiel , and the cloud computing company Amazon Web Services, among others. At the heart of the founding of OpenAI was the recognition of the power of artificial intelligence and the question of how that power would be used. In 2019 Altman compared the work of OpenAI to the Manhattan Project , which developed the first atomic bomb , telling The New York Times that the Manhattan Project had been “on the scale of OpenAI—the level of ambition we aspire to.” He is proud to point out that he and J. Robert Oppenheimer share a birthday. In 2018 Musk told Altman that Musk should run OpenAI so that it could catch up to Google. Altman turned Musk down, and Musk left OpenAI, which put the organization in a difficult position because Musk had been funding its work. Because AI development requires a large amount of computer resources, in 2019 OpenAI created a for-profit company that would fund OpenAI’s work but would be controlled by the nonprofit board. The for-profit part of OpenAI then partnered with the software company Microsoft to use its cloud computing service Azure, while Microsoft integrated OpenAI software into its products. Microsoft controlled 49 percent of OpenAI. OpenAI made great advances with large language models (LLMs), which are trained on copious amounts of written material to provide responses to users’ prompts, and with natural language processing (NLP), which computers use to respond to requests written in human language rather than in specialized programming languages. OpenAI’s family of LLMs, which use the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) architecture, serve as the foundation of two popular products. DALL-E, introduced in 2021, takes a user’s prompt (e.g., “Klimt painting of cats wearing cowboy hats assembling a dinosaur skeleton”) and generates images on the basis of the prompt. OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022 brought AI and the possibility of AGI to wider public attention. ChatGPT is software that responds to questions from users. The program’s quick responses to any subject and its impressive command of written English dazzled many, and, within five days, more than one million users had signed up. However, the fast development of AI as epitomized by ChatGPT concerned political leaders. In the months after ChatGPT’s release, U.S. Pres. Joe Biden issued an executive order about how the U.S. government would use AI, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held an AI safety summit, attended by Altman, Musk, U.S. Vice Pres. Kamala Harris , and others, at which they discussed how to mitigate possible problems caused by AI. OpenAI’s ownership structure in which a nonprofit board governed a for-profit company laid bare the tensions surrounding AI—even in the tech-forward world of Silicon Valley . Would Altman’s vision lead to a world in which AI could do things beyond the imaginings of many in the early 2020s, or would it unleash capacity that could be used to the detriment of humanity? Altman thought the dire concerns were overstated and could be addressed over time. Ultimately, the debate exploded into a battle over corporate governance . On November 17, 2023, OpenAI’s board of directors announced that it had fired Altman as CEO because “he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board” and that board chair Greg Brockman would also step down. Days of tumult followed. Most OpenAI employees signed a letter to board members demanding their resignation and threatening to leave unless Altman and Brockman were reinstated. One member of the board, computer scientist Ilya Sutskever, signed the letter, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that he regretted his role in firing Altman. On November 20 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Altman and Brockman would lead an AI research team at that company; however, negotiations continued between Altman and OpenAI’s board. On November 21 all but one board member agreed to resign, a new board was named, and Altman and Brockman returned to OpenAI. Altman’s conduct as CEO would also undergo an independent investigation.
