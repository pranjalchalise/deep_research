Just before activating it a friend advised me that he read on the Universities Website that they had MS-365 for free. On their first day they log in with their Username and Password and when clicking a link are taken to a MS Portal to download Outlook, Word, Excell, PowerPoint, etc. To Wit: \" Office 365 Education is the Microsoft 365 suite available at no cost to students, faculty, and staff at UMass Amherst. Eligible members of the university community can install Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote on up to 5 devices (Windows or Mac) and Office apps on mobile devices including Windows tablets and iPads. The program also includes 1TB of OneDrive storage. Office 365 Education on Windows also includes Publisher and Access.\" So, I uninstalled MS-365 but I cannot help but wonder if there are some remnants left behind from the uninstall that will cause problems when the version from the Microsoft Portal is downloaded. A rogue Registry entry? Any number of things. Again, my installation was not activated. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?
