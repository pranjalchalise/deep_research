  "data": "Professor Claudio Cantù has been awarded this year's Eric K. Fernström prize for young, highly promising and successful researchers at Linköping University. Photographer: Ulrik Svedin Claudio Cantù, recipient of the Eric K. Fernström Prize 2024 for young, highly promising and successful researchers. (Stock Photo) - Receiving such a prestigious award gives me a great sense of validation. In science, it is important that one's results are accepted and convince others. We have taken many risks for testing new, sometimes crazy hypotheses, but now we know that most of them were truly worth the efforts, he says. Claudio Cantù is professor in cell and molecular biology at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV). Since 2018, he leads the Cantùlab at the Wallenberg Center For Molecular Medicine (WCMM), which conducts research on the genomics of embryonic development. Claudio’s team studies how from one single cell we become fully functioning organisms. In the award committee's citation, it can be read: \"Claudio Cantù is a passionate researcher who is driven by the question of how the genome regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation. In this work, he has had great success, which has shown itself in the form of significant research grants, as well as high-quality publications.” A prize for the entire research group Claudio Cantù (Stock Photo). Photographer: Ulrik Svedin In the lab, Claudio and his team examine the genome (hereditary information) and have developed new techniques to understand its function. Claudio emphasizes that the award is recognition for the entire research group, not just for him. - In describing the merits that are recognized by this prize it is for me of extreme importance my use of the plural pronoun we. Science is not a solitary endeavour. While the discoveries made by my research groups have been initially inspired by my previous work and ideas, these very ideas have been shaped, massaged, and re-built by my team members: all of them are becoming a better scientist than I will ever be, and each of them should be credited with an equal share of recognition. What is the secret behind your success? - One key of success, in my opinion, is to establish a research group on the ground of positive values; attainment of these is for me a measure of success. One value is creativity: we wish to discover new biological phenomena, by whatever means. Crazy ideas, new tools, parallel strategies and acceptance of failure are the key ingredients. I hope that my coworkers feel free to exercise all these forms of intellectual and experimental work. If not, I want them to let me know! How does it feel now to be awarded this prize? - When I started my research lab, in 2018, I was scared and worried that I would not be able to transform ideas into research projects, or even that my ideas were not good in the first place! Seeing that what we have done is appreciated and considered of value, gives me immense pride and joy. The award committee's motivation: Claudio Cantù is a passionate researcher driven by the question of how the genome regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation. In this work, he has had great success, which has shown itself in the form of significant research grants, as well as high-quality publications. Using elegant models, Claudio Cantù describes the mechanisms for how the genome controls the future identity of embryonic cells, new insights that can also explain the emergence of cancer cells. This year's award ceremony takes place at “Forskningens dag/Research day” in Lund 6 November. Short Facts Claudio Cantù Professor in Molecular and Developmental Biology at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV), and group leader at the Wallenberg Center For Molecular Medicine (WCMM).

The Fernström Prize (Fernströmpriset) The Eric K. Fernström Foundation was formed in 1978 to promote scientific and medical research. The primary purpose of the Foundation is to make awards of monetary prizes to researchers who have made outstanding contributions within the medical sciences. Fernström’s special desire was to stimulate younger researchers. The Foundation therefore makes one award of a Nordic prize and one award to young medical researchers active in Sweden. Each one of Sweden’s medical faculties designates its own prize winner. The Cantù Lab - Genome Regulation in Development and Disease The Cantù Lab - Genome Regulation in Development and Disease The Cantù Lab at LiU is focused on one important goal: to discover the mechanisms of genome regulation that drive cell differentiation and specialization during embryonic development. Read more about Claudio Cantù \"We have so much to learn from each other\" On 8-9 december 2025, it was once again time to bring together the WCMM/DDLS affiliates for a retreat. Mechanism in embryonic development makes cancer aggressive Tumour cells in colorectal cancer exploit an important signalling pathway that normally controls embryo development.

Customer confidence is crucial to how new technology is received As customers, we can become both satisfied and more interested when a company offers digital, innovative services, such as an AI-based solution. At the same time, this can make us reject those services. American poets society Literary scholar Elin Käck is probably the only person who has done her work experience programme with a poet. She enjoys spending her summers in various archives and has recently presented her research on American poets’ travels in Europe. Political polarisation blocks more sustainable transport Trains and planes have become part of our polarised social climate one is often set against the the other. This political gridlock hinders progress towards a more sustainable transport system. This is the conclusion of a doctoral thesis at LiU. Digital services can increase exclusion When public agencies introduce digital services, one goal is to improve accessibility for citizens. But for residents in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, this may create new barriers to integration. This is shown in a doctoral thesis from LiU. Electric motors are transforming hydraulics Electrifying hydraulics on, for example, an excavator can significantly improve efficiency. However, it requires major technical changes.
