Arguably beginning with the Manchurian Incident in 1931 and ending with Japan's surrender to the Allies in 1945, the Second World War lasted longer in Asia than anywhere else. Yet, histories of the global conflict still tend to focus disproportionately on the European theater. Countering that tendency, this course surveys the Asian theater, asking and answering a number of questions: How did imperialism and the rise of nationalist movements precipitate total war in Asia? What was the character of the warfare and how did it transform politics and societies in Asia? How did the war alter the geopolitical configuration of Asia and give rise to the Cold War? What are the continuing legacies of the war in the region today? While we will use Japan as a fulcrum to engage these questions, the course will attend to the regional dynamics of World War II in Asia. This is a 100-level survey that presumes no prior familiarity with Asia or the Second World War. Not offered in 2025-26.

We look historically at issues that continue to have relevance today, including: invasive species, deforestation, soil-nitrogen availability, water use, desertification, and air pollution. Themes include: the relationship of nineteenth-century colonialism and environmental degradation, gender and environmental change, the racial dimensions of ecological issues, and the spatial aspects of human interactions with nature. We will take at least one field trip. In addition, we will watch three films that approach nineteenth-century environmental issues from different vantage points. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 18 students. Not offered in 2025-26. Professor Melillo. 2025-26: Not offered Other years: Offered in Spring 2012 , Spring 2014 , Spring 2015 , Fall 2018 , Spring 2020 , Spring 2021 , Spring 2023 105 Global Environmental History of the Twentieth Century (Offered as HIST 105 and ENST 105) This course examines the environmental history of the world since 1900 with a particular focus on Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and China. We will use books, articles, four films, and a range of online media to illuminate the comparative and interdisciplinary possibilities of global environmental history. In addition to studying the past, we will explore how to use historical knowledge in the formulation of policy recommendations and grassroots initiatives for addressing contemporary environmental issues. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 20 students. Fall semester. Professor Plishka.

Spanning topics from Jewish newspapers in India to musicians in North Africa, it examines how Jewish communities responded to the religious, political, and cultural transformations associated with modernity. Drawing each week from works by intellectuals, journalists, poets, and revolutionaries, the course illuminates a globally interconnected community. Organized thematically, it investigates the roles of women, the press, and empire, moving beyond elite politics and state-centric narratives. By placing Jewish experiences in broader local and regional contexts, students will explore how these perspectives both enrich and complicate our understanding of the Middle East. The course culminates in an independent research paper tailored to student interests, suitable for all students regardless of major or prior coursework. Two meetings weekly. Fall Semester. Professor Amir. Other years: Offered in Fall 2025 111 The Holocaust (Offered as HIST 111 and EUST 111.) This course is a detailed examination of the history of the Holocaust. The Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jews of Europe was an event of global proportions and significance, which still shapes the world in which we live. In this introductory course we will interrogate the origins and preconditions of the Nazi genocide and analyze the transition of Nazi policy from exclusion and persecution of the Jews to systematic murder. We will closely study the perpetrators and try to understand how “ordinary men” became mass murderers. Students will reflect on the historical significance of the \"bystanders.\" Throughout the semester we will pay special attention to Jewish dilemmas and conduct during the Holocaust, in response to persecution and mass murder. The Holocaust raises some of the most formidable challenges for historians. Students in this course will identify the major debates and controversies among historians and will gain a deep understanding of the nature and significance of these dilemmas of historical interpretation. Three class meetings per week. Limited to 45 students. Fall semester. Professors Epstein and Gordon. Other years: Offered in Fall 2022 , Fall 2023 , Fall 2025 112 Russian Empire in Eurasia (Offered as HIST 112, ASLC 112, EUST 112 and RUSS 130) In the course of almost 500 years, the Russian Empire evolved from a backwater principality at the crossroad of Eastern Europe and Eurasia into one of history’s largest polities. By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources. Two class meetings per week. Fall semester. Professor Semyonov. Other years: Offered in Spring 2012 , Spring 2018 , Spring 2022 , Fall 2024 , Fall 2025 114 Race, Empire, and Transnationalism: Chinese Diasporic Communities in the U.S. and the World (Offered as HIST 114, AMST 114 and ASLC 114) How does a study of the Chinese diasporic communities in Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, the United States, and other parts of the world help us understand the questions of ethnic identity formation, construction, and negotiation? More specifically, how does the study of their history and experiences force us to rethink the concepts of “China” and “Chinese-ness”? How did scholars, officials, and travelers construct the categories of “China” and being “Chinese”? These are the main questions that we seek to answer in this introductory course to the history of the Chinese diaspora. We will begin by looking into the early history of Chinese migration (circa 1500 to 1800) to particular geographical areas in the world, including the United States. The rest of the course will look into the history of selected diasporic communities from the nineteenth to the twenty-first centuries. All throughout the course we will also examine how these diasporic people and their families manipulated and continue to manipulate attempts by dominant groups to control their identities, bodies, and resources, and how their lives challenge the meanings of “China” and “Chinese-ness.” Other questions to be discussed during the course are: What caused people from China to move, and to where? What forms of discrimination and control did they experience? How do their experiences and histories deepen our understanding of “race,” “empire,” and “transnationalism”? Themes to be discussed throughout the course include imperialism, colonialism, race, ethnicity, gender, nationalism, transnationalism, orientalism, hegemony, and globalization. Two class meetings per week. Omitted 2025-26.

This course offers an introduction to the global medieval world through interdisciplinary methods. Drawing from the disciplines of art history, architectural history, and history, this course challenges the idea that the period between 500–1500 was a ‘dark age’ in world history. Rather, through a study of visual culture, texts, and architecture the course emphasizes the complexity, diversity, and connectivity that characterized the medieval period. The medieval world was made by the movement of people and objects through land and sea across East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Central and Western Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean basin. We explore this rich global history through sources such as granite inscriptions, indigo-dyed cotton textiles, palm-leaf manuscripts, temples, and cities. We consider what role translation of languages and material culture played in creating a global medieval world. Finally, this course challenges Eurocentric perspectives that equate medieval history with western Europe. Two meetings per week. Omitted 2025-26. Professors Rice and Gomes. 2025-26: Not offered Other years: Offered in Spring 2024 122 Readings in the European Tradition II Other years: Offered in Spring 2012 , Spring 2013 , Spring 2014 , Spring 2015 , Spring 2017 , Spring 2018 , Spring 2019 , Spring 2020 , Spring 2021 , Spring 2024 128 Get Medieval: Europe from 500-1500 (Offered as HIST 128 and EUST 128.) The Middle Ages are typically defined as the period between 500-1500 CE, and this course aims to draw a new image of these thousand years in terms of periodization, geography, gender, race, and culture. On the one hand, we will examine processes of establishing power by exclusion, such as the race-thinking that coalesced around Jewish and Muslim believers or the strong hierarchies built to privilege men. On the other hand, this course also considers the inconsistencies of these systems of domination, including how women resisted patriarchal dominance and the intimate social, political, and cultural entanglements between different faith communities. In exploring these elements of the medieval world, we will encounter thirsty monks, naughty nuns, clout chasing popes, black saints, and all manner of other diverse individuals who articulated capacious notions of self, other, and the world. Finally, this course attends to the ramifications of medieval European history on the future of the globe. Not offered in 2025-26. Professor Murrell. 2025-26: Not offered Other years: Offered in Fall 2020 , Fall 2021 , Fall 2022 , Spring 2025 130 World War I (Offered as HIST 130 and EUST 130) The image of the First World War is so iconic that it can be evoked through a handful of tropes: trenches, machine guns, mud, “going over the top,” crossing “no man’s land.” Yet in many ways this is a partial vision, one that focuses myopically on the experiences of European soldiers who occupied a few hundred miles of trenches in northern France. Why is it that a conflict as unprecedented in its size and complexity as “the Great War” has been reduced in our minds to this very limited scale? This course both explores the role of World War I in our cultural imagination and aims to create a broader, messier, and more complicated portrait of the history. It will examine the conflict on multiple fronts, studying the perspectives of both European and non-European soldiers and civilians, and analyze the war’s role in shaping the twentieth century. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 35 students. Omitted 2025-26.

We depart from the origins of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula to explore the evolution of legal and scholarly traditions, art, architecture, science, technology, literature and a wide array of social institutions as they took shape across fast expanding Islamic empires. We will also move beyond dynasties, politics, and religion to dissect social categories like gender, race, and class as they evolved in Islamic societies and the role of non-Muslims in making the Islamic world, both as subjects of Islamic empires and the leaders of rival polities. In addition to lectures, discussions, and texts, the course will also draw from podcasts, primary sources, visual culture, and other nontraditional texts to enliven our examination of the Islamic world. Fall semester. Two meetings weekly. Professor Ghazarian. Other years: Offered in Fall 2025 139 Introduction to the Modern Middle East This course offers an introduction to the history of the Middle East, North Africa, and neighboring regions from 1800 to the present. It aims to highlight the region’s inhabitants and their perspectives and experiences of the past two centuries. Beginning in the late 18th century Age of Revolutions, the region’s people faced many new global currents: the twinned developments of capitalism and colonialism; a turn toward more representative forms of government; new notions of political, religious, and ethnic belonging; and upheavals of class, gender and family relations. Throughout the course, we will analyze how historical actors understood and responded to these changes. What actions and claims were they making for justice, freedom, and/or a different world? Meets twice weekly. Spring semester. Professor Ghazarian. 155 Twentieth-Century America The course traces United States political, social, and cultural history from 1900 to the present. Among the topics covered are the rise of the modern corporation, class conflict and the Progressive movement; immigration, ethnic pluralism, and the rise of mass culture; the Great Depression and the New Deal; World War II, the Cold War, and McCarthyism; the civil rights, women’s and environmental movements, the New Left, the New Right, and the continuing inequalities of race and class. Films and videos will regularly supplement class readings. Three class meetings per week. Limited to 40 students. Not offered in 2025-26.

This course will seek to understand the effect of expansion on the nation’s values, institutions, and history, and examine the methods used to extend the nation’s borders, trade, and influence. It engages “foreign relations” in broad terms to incorporate ideology, race, gender, technology, economics, geopolitics, and culture as important forces in shaping the United States’ understanding of and behavior toward the world. The country’s domestic character critically determined the ways in which the nation’s power took shape on the world stage, even as global interactions shaped nascent U.S. institutions and identities. This course will examine how economic and security needs shaped foreign policy goals, while social norms and domestic values informed the ways Americans interacted with other societies.

Professor Walker. 2025-26: Not offered Other years: Offered in Fall 2022 , Fall 2023 157 The U.S. in the World: 1898 to the Present This course investigates the United States’ foreign relations in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries and seeks to understand why and how it has become increasingly involved in world affairs. Starting with the War of 1898 and closing with the contemporary global war on terrorism, it examines the interplay of domestic and foreign considerations that have defined the “American Century.” This period raises important questions about the nature of American power in relation to traditional empires. The course asks students to think critically about the United States in the context of imperialism and explore how Americans, both in and out of government, sought to reconcile domestic values and identities with the country’s growing global presence. It investigates the ideological, economic, political, social, racial, and security considerations that shaped America’s emergence as a world power and formed the basis of modern American foreign policy and domestic society. Three class meetings per week. Limited to 40 students (10 spots reserved for first-year students). Not offered 2025-26.

We will learn about foundational and current themes in the field of Asian American history. Using an intersectional approach, the course traces how issues related to gender and sexuality impact Asian American racial formation in the U.S. For example, we look at how particular immigration pathways impact the lives of Asian immigrant communities differently depending on individuals’ gender and sexual identities. We also explore the ways the fetishization of Asian American women and men has influenced shifts in American foreign and domestic policy. Major themes include labor migration, community formation, U.S. imperialism, legal exclusion, racial segregation, cultural representations, and social movements. Students will also examine digital oral history archives throughout the U.S., and work collectively on an oral history project on the history of Asian American student activism at Amherst College and beyond. Two meetings per week. Limited to 40 students. Omitted 2025-26.

Do popular representations distort the queer past and if so, to what end? By studying LGBTQ history through primary source materials, students will develop a rich and nuanced historical view of such major issues as the homophile movement, the Stonewall riot and other acts of resistance, the rise of the gay press, lesbian feminism, Harvey Milk, the March on Washington, anti-gay violence and hate crimes, the youth/student movement, HIV/AIDS, ACT-UP, Lawrence v. Texas , same-sex marriage, and the transgender revolution. By juxtaposing historic research with screenings of contemporary television and film, students will reflect on the power and limits of such representations and further consider why real stories of LGBTQ communities and people remain so elusive. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 30 students. Not offered in 2025-26.

Long before terms such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender were coined, people challenged gender norms and engaged in same-sex sex, love, and relationships. This course introduces students to the dynamic, contested, inspiring, and sometimes quite challenging histories of this wide-ranging group of queer and trans people in the first 250 years of American history. We will learn about the lives, loves, values, and occupations of a racially and geographically diverse group of people. What laws existed to regulate the freedom and lives of queer and trans early Americans? What role did religion play in shaping dominant attitudes? Were queer and trans people isolated or in community? Did they live in all parts of the country, whether rural, urban, or suburban or did they more commonly reside in certain regions? By working extensively with primary source documents such as laws, diaries, personal letters, court records, newspaper articles, novels, and memoirs, we will learn not only about individual experiences but also how their friends, neighbors, and families understood them. How did individuals navigate contradictions between their own desires, prevailing cultural norms, religious beliefs, and existing legal codes? While individuals survived and thrived in many contexts from Puritan New England to the U.S. military to working class enclaves in New York city to rural homesteads, they faced tremendous hardship while doing so. Students will walk away with a rich and nuanced understanding of what life was like for queer and trans Americans before the emergence of visible, safe, and organized LGBTQ communities. Two class meetings per week. Limit to 25 students. Spring semester. Professor Manion. 171 History of Dynastic China (Offered as HIST 171 and ASLC 171.) This introductory course provides a broad overview of China’s long history and major cultural traditions from its very beginnings to the eve of modernity. No familiarity with China or previous experience in the study of history is assumed or required. Over the course of the semester, we will investigate long-term economic, social, and cultural transformations in Chinese history. We will examine a broad array of issues, such as the role of geography in shaping history, the glorified antiquity in traditional Chinese political thought, the rise and fall of dynastic empires, China’s troubled relationship with the Inner Asian steppe and nomadic societies, cycles of peasant rebellions and civil wars, emergence of major philosophical schools and the canonization of Confucian thought, establishment of the civil examination system and a bureaucratic state, the formation of a literati elite and its culture, rise of Buddhism and Daoism, evolution of gender, family, and kinship structures, and China’s engagement with the outside world through trade and diplomacy. In this course, students will engage a wide range of primary sources—ancient classics, poems, films, paintings, novels, and memoirs—and learn to develop skills in reading these sources in their historical contexts. At several points in the semester, we will also look at how this history has been used and recycled in contemporary politics and popular culture and reflect upon the continuing legacies of this history for China and the world today. Classes will entail lectures combined with close readings and discussions that engage primary texts, interpretive essays, and film. Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

This survey offers students a deep historical perspective on today’s China and Chinese society. It examines the matrix of the internal and external forces and movements that have shaped modern China from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. During this period, people in China have experienced the most tumultuous and traumatic events in its transformations toward modernity; few countries have gone through as many dramatic changes as China in the last two centuries. We will study China’s modern transformations by exploring a series of momentous events, including the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the collapse of the imperial system and the Republican Revolution, the “New Culture Movement,” Communist revolution, World War II, the Chinese Civil War, the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the Korean War, the Great Leap Forward, Mao’s Cultural Revolution, post-Mao economic reform, the Tian’anmen protests, and China’s recent development as a rising global superpower. Through examining these events, we will explore important themes such as China’s troubled transformation from an empire to a nation-state, the rise of new Chinese cultures, gender and family revolutions, economic and industrial modernization, student activism, and China’s changing relationship with the outside world. Readings, which include a wide variety of documents such as religious and revolutionary tracts, eyewitness accounts, memoirs, letters, and fiction, are supplemented by interpretive essays and videos. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester. Professor Qiao.

South Asia comprises the modern nation-states of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka and is one of the most diverse regions of the world. The course challenges Eurocentric and Orientalist ideas of a timeless and singular South Asia. It explores how this region changed over time and has been a part of world-history connected through economic exchange, movement of people and languages, and violent conquests. We will study film, paintings, inscriptions, and pottery and analyse different approaches to the history of the region. This study will help us better understand the history of South Asia as part of world-history at large. Two meetings per week. Not offered in 2025-26.

Contrary to images of a uniform and stable culture, the Japanese archipelago possesses a history marked by fragmentation, violent conflict, and dynamic cultural change. This course traces that history from the beginnings of human history on the archipelago to the establishment of one of the most stable and peaceful regimes in human history, the Tokugawa shogunate. Our survey will be organized around a central riddle: why was it so difficult to produce a stable, unified polity on the Japanese archipelago? Placing Japan within the broader regional context of East Asia, we will answer this riddle by following the rise of successive political authorities, from the sacral rulers of the tomb period to the samurai. Prominent themes include the rise of early polities, contact with the Chinese continent and Korean peninsula, the aristocratic culture of the Heian court and its displacement by medieval samurai rule, the role of Buddhist thought and institutions, the “warring states” period of the sixteenth-century and cosmopolitan contact with Christian Europe, and the Tokugawa peace and its urban cultural forms. Throughout, we will read a variety of sources, including eighth-century mythology, aristocratic literature, war chronicles, religious and philosophical texts, as well as modern fiction and film. This is a writing attentive survey of Japan’s history from antiquity through the eighteenth century. It traces political, social, and cultural developments in order to provide basic literacy in pre-modern Japanese history and a basis both for comparative history and further course work in Japanese history. Classes will combine lectures with close readings and discussions of the assigned texts. Requirements include short Moodle posts and topical essays. Three class meetings per week. Not offered in 2025-26.

The transformation of the Japanese archipelago from a relatively secluded agrarian polity in the early-nineteenth century into the world’s second largest economic power by the end of the twentieth century is one of the most dramatic stories of modern history. This course introduces the history of this transformation through two “revolutions”: the formation of an imperialist nation-state and the post-World War II creation of a pacifist democracy. Situating these revolutions within regional and global contexts, we will pay close attention to the political debates and social conflicts that accompanied Japan’s drastic transformations. We will begin with the collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate, follow the rise of the modern Japanese nation-state through colonial expansion and total war, and conclude with postwar economic recovery, democratization, and the socio-political challenges facing the Japanese nation-state in the twenty-first century. Our goal along the way will be to explore in the specific context of Japanese history themes relevant to the history of global modernities: the collapse of a traditional regime, the creation of a nation-state, imperialism, industrialization, feminist and socialist critiques, total war, democratization, high economic growth and mass consumerism, including so-called “otaku” culture. Classes will entail lectures combined with close readings and discussions that engage primary texts, interpretive essays, and film. This is a writing attentive course with requirements including short writing exercises and topical essays. There will be a take-home final exam. Three class meetings per week. Not offered in 2025-26.

We have three major questions that we will be pursuing throughout the semester. The first concerns various images of Africa and Africans, conceived in the West and then exported back into African societies. Can we distinguish the image from the reality, the myth from the reportage? The second question involves the causal relationship between colonial rule and the function and dysfunction of postcolonial rule: Are some or all of Africa’s contemporary problems traceable to the colonial past? Finally, we will try to understand what it was like to live within several African societies and through several momentous events in this historical period. The underlying questions we will explore are when and how history matters for understanding why the present is the way it is and whether history offers any insights into resolving longstanding problems. In the first half of the course, we will study the imperial scramble to colonize Africa, the broad integration of African societies into global economic and social trends, the social, political, and economic impact of imperial policies, popular Western images of Africa in the colonial period, nationalist struggles, the genocide in Rwanda, and persistent problem faced by post-colonial states. In the second half of the course, we will investigate three case studies: the post-colonial Democratic Republic of Congo, the political economy of disease in Africa, and development quandaries and resource conflicts.

The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) Islam in the context of late antiquity; (2) The Abbasid Empire: Perso-Islamicate synthesis and the articulation of Islamic institutions; and (3) The Ottomans in the Classical Age. The thematic focus of the course is on cross-cultural exchange, adaptation and synthesis. Students will become familiar with a variety of seminal primary texts, the principle historiographical arguments and debates in the secondary literature, and methodological tools of inquiry. The course culminates in a project designed to allow students to explore the Ottoman Empire in accordance with their own interests, and to introduce students to research methods. The course is appropriate for all students, regardless of major or prior coursework on the Middle East. Two meetings per week. Omitted 2025-26.

The Indian Ocean World (IOW) is a vast world region that includes parts of five areas: Africa, Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Thousands of large and small islands are also part of the IOW. Inspired by the “global turn” in history, we learn about the diversity of human experiences and histories in the IOW. Themes include Roman trade with India, travels of Buddhist scholars, Islamic empires, movement of commodities, pilgrimage, slavery, and European expansion and imperialism. Throughout the course, we explore how to think about the IOW both in terms of geography and concepts, question Eurocentric perspectives on the region, and ask: does our understanding of history change when we look away from land divided by nation-states and toward people connected by oceans? Two meetings per week. Omitted 2025-26. Professor Gomes. 2025-26: Not offered 202 Jewish History through Jewish Languages (Offered as HIST 202 and ASLC 202) This course explores Jewish history through the diverse languages spoken by Jewish communities from antiquity to today. From the scriptural centrality of Biblical Hebrew to the vibrancy of modern Yiddish culture in the United States, we will investigate what attitudes towards language reveal about Jewish creative, spiritual, and political life. Engaging directly with texts in Aramaic, Ladino, Yiddish, Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Persian, and other Jewish languages (in translation), students will examine how Jews interacted historically with surrounding cultures. Political and theoretical frameworks—including religion, immigration, Zionism, socialism, popular culture, and myth—will help uncover commonalities across time and geography, challenging fixed notions of culture, nationalism, and ideology. The course culminates in an independent research paper tailored to student interests, suitable for all students regardless of major or prior coursework. Two meetings weekly. Fall semester. Professor Amir. Other years: Offered in Fall 2025 204 Jewish History in the Modern Age This course introduces students to the history of the Jews from the 16th century to the present. Jews—a small group, lacking a stable geographical or political center for most of modern history—have played a remarkably central role in world events. Jewish history exemplifies questions of tolerance, intolerance, and diversity in the Modern Age. From Europe to the Americas to the Middle East, Jewish history has witnessed constant interchange between the non-Jewish world and its Jewish subcultures. This course investigates Jewish history’s multiple dimensions: developments in Jews’ political status and economic opportunity; dramatic demographic shifts and global migrations; transformations in Jewish cultures, ideologies and identities; and religious adjustments to modernity. We examine a variety of Jewish encounters with the modern world: integration, acculturation, assimilation, anti-Semitism, Jewish dissimilation and nationalism. Finally, the course will use this broad historical lens to explore and contextualize the double watershed of the 1940s—the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel—as well as contemporary Jewish life. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester. Professors A. Gordon and Daniel Amir. Other years: Offered in Spring 2023 205 European Intellectual History and Its Discontents (Offered as HIST-205 and EUST-129.) Intellectual history concerns itself with the study of social and political ideas. These ideas are known by big words, such as Conservatism, Liberalism, Socialism. As George Orwell once remarked: “The worst thing one can do with words is to surrender to them.” This course will help students to create a distance needed to analyze the big ideas and the meaning beneath them and help acquire skills for exploration of the origin of key social and political concepts, their development and impact. The readings for this class will take students on a journey through the battle of ideas in Europe at the end of the 19th and early 20th century when tensions and paradoxes of modernity surfaced in the form of political and social divisions. This journey will continue through the “Age of Extremes” and the confrontation between Communism, Fascism, and renewed Liberalism observing the legacy of this defining for the 20th century history moment.

Other years: Offered in Spring 2023 , Spring 2024 , Fall 2024 , Fall 2025 206 They Not Like Us: Race in the Medieval Mediterranean When did race begin? This course explores answers to this question by focusing on the multi-faith and multicultural Mediterranean between the eighth-fifteenth centuries – prior to the rise of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the ideas it spawned about race that have violently shaped the present. We will study how the Christian and Islamic societies of southern Europe, Mediterranean Africa, and the Near East invented racial frameworks when and as it suited their needs. Over the course of the semester, students will be introduced to the literary, historical, and art historical frameworks and sources for the study of premodern race in such spheres as the law, religion, gender, enslavement, violence, and status. Through close reading of texts, images, and objects, we will consider the contingencies and complexities of race-making within and across the communities of the medieval Mediterranean. The course will also examine the legacy of premodern race in shaping modern ideologies, curricula, and politics. Why have groups from the Ku Klux Klan to far-right extremists to ISIS invoked the medieval past as a homogeneous, racially \"pure\" space? No prerequisites, open to students of all majors. Two class meetings per week. Fall semester. Professor Murrell. Other years: Offered in Fall 2025 207 The Wild and the Cultivated (Offered as HIST 207 and ENST 207) For thousands of years, wild and domesticated plants have played crucial roles in the development of cultures and societies. Students in this course will consider human relationships with plants from a global-historical perspective, comparing trends in various regions and time periods. We will focus on the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution, seed-saving practices, medicinal plants, religious rites, food traditions, biopiracy, agribusiness, and biofuels. Two class meetings per week.

We will begin in 1571 with the opening of Manila as a Spanish trading port and end in 1898 with the Spanish-American War. Over the course of the semester, we will discuss the trans-Pacific silver and silk trades, the function of Catholic missionaries in shaping the Pacific World, environmental exchanges between the Americas and Asia, indigenous resistance to imperialism, and the role of Pacific peoples in the development of the world economy.

It highlights the importance of Islamic law’s formations within early modern Muslim empires, like those of the Ottomans, Mughals, and Safavids, as well other parts of the globe. Developments in Islamic law and society in this period are crucial not only for better understanding the history of sharia or the Islamic world, but for better understanding law, state, and society writ large. After an introduction to the key actors and concepts of Islamic law, the course examines themes including law and state power; property & wealth; commerce; non-Muslim subjects of Muslim rulers; and women, gender, and sex. Meets twice weekly. Omitted 2025-26.

Through discussion, lectures, readings, and visual analysis we will consider the historical and artistic roots of their radical aesthetics as well as the ideals and struggles that shaped their lives. During their era, Kahlo was overshadowed by her husband Rivera, but in recent decades her fame has eclipsed his. To make sense of this we will address the changing meaning of their art over time, especially in relation to markets, social movements, and gender and sexual identities. By the end of the semester, students will have a strong understanding of these two artists and their work, as well as the contexts in which they lived and in which their art continues to circulate, including early twentieth-century Modernism, the Mexican Revolution, indigenismo, the Chicano Movement, and recent efforts toward ethnic and gender inclusion. No prerequisites, open to all years and majors. No prerequisites, open to all years and majors. Spring semester. Professor Lopez.

Many Americans think of the northern United States as removed from and antagonistic toward slavery. The truth is much more complicated. Slavery existed in the region for generations, and northerners continued to support and profit from slavery in the South and the Caribbean even after the institution came to an end in the North. For example, northerners produced and sold to enslavers the food, clothing, shackles, and other items that kept plantations in operation. This course explores northern racism and northern complicity with slavery in the antebellum period and considers the present-day legacies of this history. It grapples with topics such as how the economies of North and South tied the regions together, how wealth built through slavery and the slave trade was used to establish northern institutions of higher education, and how structures put in place during slavery have lived on after abolition. It also looks at northern abolitionism, examining how some northerners Black and white fought slavery and why this aspect of the region’s history has featured so much more prominently in historical memory than northern complicity with slavery. Students will investigate the North’s complicated relationships to slavery by working with primary and secondary sources, visiting historical materials related to Amherst College’s connections to slavery in the college archives, and going on a field trip. Two meetings weekly. Limited to 15 students. Sophomore Seminar. Not offered in 2025-26.

Often viewed as one of the defining events in modern history, the French Revolution has been debated and discussed, derided and celebrated by generations of politicians, cultural commentators, and historians. This course enters into this on-going conversation by examining the nature of the revolutionary process as it unfolded in late eighteenth-century France and its empire. Beginning in the “old regime” of kings and commoners, it untangles the social, political, and intellectual roots of the Revolution and investigates the extent to which these factors contributed to the radical overthrow of the French establishment in 1789. It then follows the extension of the Revolution throughout French society and across the seas to the Caribbean, analyzing how popular and colonial upheavals influenced the revolutionary new order of “liberty, equality, and brotherhood” that was taking shape in France. Finally, the course explores the aftermath of the Revolution by tracing the various ways that its history has been interpreted and reinterpreted from the nineteenth century to the present day.

At its height, this small island nation ruled one-quarter of the earth’s surface and more than 450 million of its inhabitants. Not only did British imperialism play a decisive role in shaping world politics, economics, and cultures in its day, it also left a number of profound legacies that continue to affect our lives in the present. This course traces the rise, fall, and lasting influence of the British empire, and pays particular attention to questions of race and ethnicity. Through a series of colonial encounters--such as the first contacts made between explorers and Pacific Islanders in the eighteenth century, the interactions between missionaries and Africans in the nineteenth century, or the migration of South Asians to Britain in the twentieth century--it examines what “race” meant in different historical contexts. The course thus explores the institutionalization of racism in government, law, and society, and analyzes moments in which racism has been combated and overturned. Readings and course materials will be drawn from secondary and primary sources, including newspapers, novels, photographs, artwork, oral histories, and films. Not offered in 2025-26. Enrollment limited to 30 students.

This course explores racial capitalism through the lenses of history and economics. Racial capitalism understands racism, slavery, segregation, and imperialism as key to how the economic system of capitalism enables the creation of profit for some via the racialized exploitation of others. After reading foundational texts in the beginning of the semester, we will consider how slavery devalued Black lives and labor, look at the economic benefits of whiteness, and investigate a series of case studies illuminating racist capitalist logics in areas such as real estate, school funding, and mass incarceration. The semester will end with a consideration of the historical case for and the economics of reparations. This seminar course will be co-taught by faculty in economics and history. Students will focus on close reading of texts and engage in class discussion. There will be both low-stakes and high-stakes writing assignments, including in-class writing, reflection posts, and research papers. No prior coursework in economics is required. Course meets twice weekly. Spring semester. Limited to 20 students. Professors Herbin-Triant and Reyes. Other years: Offered in Fall 2013 , Spring 2024 234 Nazi Germany (Offered as HIST 234 and EUST 234) This class is an introduction to the history of Nazi Germany from 1933-1945. Through readings and class discussion, we will cover topics such as the Holocaust, Nazi ideology and aesthetics, daily life in the Third Reich, women under Nazism, Nazi foreign policy and World War II, and the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial. In addition, we will discuss themes that range well beyond the Nazi dictatorship: What is the relationship between aesthetics and politics? How do dictatorships function? What constitutes political resistance? How and why do regimes engage in mass murder? We will examine a wide variety of primary-source documents (including films, memoirs, and diaries), as well as secondary historical accounts of the Nazi era. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 30 students. Spring semester. Professor Epstein.

Stalinism became a phenomenon that influenced the development of the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and North Korea. The course will begin with the exploration of Stalin’s own life and then focus on what historical forces enabled the emergence of Stalinism. It will cover the period on the eve of and during the Russian Revolution, Stalinist transformation of the USSR in the 1930s, WWII, and the onset of the Cold War. Among issues to be explored are the extent of popular support for Stalinist-type regimes, the mechanisms of large-scale political terror, the longevity of Stalinist regimes, and historical memory about Stalinism.

Spies seemed ubiquitous; nuclear annihilation imminent. Films such as Red October and the James Bond series forged a Western image of the Soviet Union. But how were these decades experienced behind the Iron Curtain? This course explores Soviet history between the end of World War II and the collapse of the USSR. We will study the roots of the Cold War; the politics of de-Stalinization in the USSR; the unfolding of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe; and Soviet relations with the West, China, and the developing world. We will also explore the internal dynamics of Soviet society: the rise of the Soviet middle class, consumerism, tourism, the entertainment industry, demographic trends, education, and public health.

We will discuss the state of the Soviet Union on the eve of dissolution and politics of nationalism; emergence of the post-Soviet states and divergence in their historical development; transition to capitalism and privatization; challenges of federalism and regionalism in post-Soviet Russia; relations between the Russian Federation and “Near Abroad,” NATO and China, and the social and cultural developments from the late Soviet period to the early twenty-first century. The class will also explore the historical evolution of the phenomenon of Putinism as rooted in long-term transformation of the former Soviet space. Two class meetings per week.

It rocked the country and the world, keeping Iran in the headlines ever since. This course will explore key events and ideas in Iran’s history from the revolution to the present day, giving students insight into the Islamic Republic, its politics, and culture. We will learn about the country through the viewpoints of its influential clerics, varied ethnic and religious minority groups, protesters trying to effect change, women demanding equal rights, soldiers on the streets and borders, and clashes between conservatives and reformers debating the country’s future. The course will examine Iran’s relationships with global and regional actors, its tensions with the United States and Israel, and diplomatic engagement over its nuclear programme. Students will gain an understanding of the way power and identity function in a country that tends to be polarizing in both political opinion and the way it is represented. Meets twice weekly. Spring semester. Visiting Professor Amir 243 Environment, Technology, and Power in the Modern Middle East (Offered as HIST 243 and ASLC 243) This course offers an introduction to the methods and key debates in environmental history and the history of science and technology in the modern Middle East. What does the history of the region look like when we foreground humanity’s relationship with nonhuman actors like the rest of nature or technical objects? To answer that question, this course aims to offer a re-reading of familiar topics in history as well as the introduction of wholly new ones. Key themes include human-animal relations, water and food systems, imperial violence, disease, carbon energy, and military weapons systems. We will explore these themes across the Middle East, Southwest Asia, Northern Africa, and neighboring regions. After a unit on theory and methods, we will discuss the Age of Revolutions, colonial empires, post-war violence, and the region’s role in the global spread of carbon energy. Fall semester. Two meetings weekly. Professor Ghazarian. Other years: Offered in Fall 2025 245 U.S. Carceral Culture (Offered as HIST 245and SWAG 247) An overview of punishment from the Enlightenment to modern times. Topics include theories of criminality; birth of the penitentiary; growth of carceral culture; role of reform movements; relationship between slavery, abolition, and punishment; rise of criminology, eugenics, and sexology; persistence of poverty among carceral subjects; and the emergence of mass incarceration. Primary sources for consideration include newspaper articles, reform and abolition organizational records, official prison reports, and legal and sociological papers. Secondary readings will be primarily historical with some critical theories of difference and power including critical race theory, feminist theories of intersectionality, queer theory, and contemporary critical prison studies.

Major questions to be addressed include the following: What visions for freedom did African Americans hold in the aftermath of slavery? How have black Americans fought to secure social, economic, and political rights? How has government both supported and subverted black people’s efforts to lay claim to citizenship? How have gender and capitalism shaped the lives and labors of black Americans? What have been the afterlives of slavery and segregation in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, particularly in the areas of voting rights, housing, mass incarceration, policing, and health outcomes? Students will use both primary and secondary sources to investigate how—in the face of numerous challenges—African Americans created vibrant new cultures, accumulated property, built strong communities, and challenged the United States to live up to its founding ideals. Readings include foundational texts in modern African-American history, including writings by Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Michelle Obama, among others. Two meetings per week. Limited to 25 students. Omitted 2025-26.

As such, the course serves as an introduction to modern US history, the black freedom struggle, and the archive of civil rights. Moving beyond mythology, this course will emphasize his connections to American liberalism, the labor movement, the black prophetic tradition and human rights. As such, this course will excavate the radical King, a man whose life and work often challenged the liberal consensus on questions of class, race, and empire, and thus questions later ahistorical characterizations of the Civil Rights Movement as either “moderate” or “conservative.” Two class meetings per week.

This is an introductory survey course on the history of Asian/Pacific/Americans (A/P/A) within the broader historical context of imperialism in the Asia-Pacific region. We will compare and contrast the historical experiences of specific groups of the A/P/A community; namely, those of Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Southeast Asian (Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Hmong), Asian Indian, and Pacific Islander descent. The first half of the course examines the U.S. involvement in the quest for “empire” in Asia-Pacific, spanning the period from approximately 1850 to World War II, focusing on the experiences of the Chinese, Filipinos, and Pacific Islanders in the United States. The second half examines the experiences of the various A/P/A communities, and relates these with the continuing U.S. imperialist and neo-colonialist policies throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

How should it expand our political dictionary? How does it challenge preconceptions about the relationship between \"religious\" and \"secular\"? Why has the concept and symbol of the Caliphate remained potent to this day? How is the idea of the Caliphate tied to a vision of a \"Golden Age\" of Islamic governance? This class deploys the central organizing idea of the caliphate to explore the diversity of Middle Eastern political thought in historical context, from the Iranian Sasanian empire to the present. Thematically, the course will address many of the following issues: ideas of the Rashidun Caliphate in the post-Prophetic period as precedent for later, \"classical\" iterations; the influence of Iranian and Turkic ideas on the development of Islamic political institutions in the Abbasid period; the Caliphate as a rallying point against Western imperialism; European Orientalist constructions of “Islam” and \"Islamic\" political thought; the abolishment of the Ottoman Caliphate following World War I; contemporary nostalgia for the Caliphate in South Asia, Turkey and Egypt. In addition to secondary sources, primary sources include: Hadith, tenth-century Islamic histories, advice literature for princes, diplomatic documents, political treatises, newspapers, and websites.

This period was characterized by military conquest, territorial expansion and the consolidation of Ottoman institutions, designed to govern an ever-expanding empire of colossal dimensions that, at its zenith, reached from the Balkans to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. This empire was home to a dizzying array of peoples, languages, religions, institutions and customs. This class takes as its starting point the idea of overlap, negotiation, and fluidity that characterized the Ottoman Empire – that the Ottomans were the Sultans of Two Worlds – the Islamic/Middle Eastern and the Byzantine/European. The course focuses on intersections and overlaps, the crossing of borders by individuals and ideas, and the way in which power was negotiated and represented by the royal dynasty in different theatres and idioms.

Focusing on rights within the United States, this course will explore how the United States has sought to balance these competing concerns in the past, and the implications of this history for contemporary debates. We will examine the shifting meaning of \"national security\" and how it has changed at key moments in the nation’s history. We will also analyze how debates over national security and rights have reflected broader partisan divides, served diverse political objectives, and reflected competing visions of national identity and purpose. The shifting relationship between these two imperatives addresses the central purpose and dilemma of democratic governance: to advance the collective good while ensuring basic freedoms for all individuals. The course will initially survey these issues through a historical lens, demonstrating how questions of security and rights have been present since the nation’s founding. Contemporary case studies will make up the bulk of the remainder of the course: refugees and immigration; domestic counter-terrorism and due process; cybersecurity and surveillance; domestic terrorism and hate crimes; detention and interrogation.

As important, they will think and write critically about the contentious history of the region. For good reason, Central America is often considered as a whole, but despite many commonalities, each country's history is unique. How did the indigenous cultures of northern Central America compare to those of the south? Why did the once-united Federation of Central America fracture into five different states? How did Honduras become the quintessential \"banana republic\"? Why did Guatemala suffer decades of military dictatorships, while Costa Rica abolished its military at the same time? Through lectures and readings, we will answer these questions as we address topics including precolonial indigenous cultures; the conquest, slavery, and encomienda; independence and the struggles of nation-building; foreign interventions; and reforms, revolutions, and counterrevolutions.

As important, they will think and write critically about the contentious history of U.S.-Latin American relations. Just a few of the many topics to be addressed are the Monroe Doctrine, the U.S. invasion of Mexico, the construction of the Panama Canal, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, and the Iran-Contra Scandal.

Their struggle continues today. This course considers the historical meanings of democracy in various Latin American countries, with particular attention to the relationship between liberalism and democracy in the nineteenth century; the broadening of democracy at the start of the twentieth century; the rise and fall of military dictatorships in the 1960s–1980s and their impact upon civil society; and the current clashes between neo-liberal economic programs and the neo-populist resurgence of the left. Readings and discussions will focus on the ways broad economic and political shifts impacted individuals' lives; how each economic class experienced these shifts differently; the way race and gender have shaped peoples' experience with democratization and repression; and the personal processes of radicalization by which individuals became inspired to take risks in their struggle for inclusion and against repression. Because the approach is thematic and chronological, some countries and regions will receive more attention than others. Meetings and readings will draw on secondary studies, historical documents, testimonials, music, images, and film. Two meetings per week. Not offered in 2025-26.

Questions we will engage include: How has imperialism impacted the environment? How have these environmental impacts shaped the possibilities for political resistance by subaltern groups? Can history guide us in our current efforts to develop a sustainable approach to the environment that helps the land and its fauna, but does so in a way that brings greater justice and self-determination to the people who live there? Is it possible to protect the environment while affirming the interests of the state and of investors? We will focus on case studies from all across Latin America, with particular emphasis on Brazil, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes. The class will introduce students to classic texts in Latin American environmental history, as well as some of the newest scholarship. Two class meetings per week. Spring semester. Professor López. Other years: Offered in Spring 2013 , Spring 2015 , Spring 2017 , Spring 2018 , Fall 2021 , Fall 2024 268 Black History of Spanish America, 1503-1886 (Offered as BLST 268 [CLA], HIST 268, and LLAS 268) Students will gain in-depth knowledge of the experiences of Africans and their descendants, slave and free, from the time the first captives were brought to Hispaniola in 1503 until the time of abolition in Cuba in 1886 in this course. Regions to be covered include the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America, and the Andean and Southern Cone regions. Topics will include the ways in which specific regions of Western Africa contributed captives to specific regions of Spanish America, the nature of Spanish colonial institutions and their impact on the lives of Africans and their descendants, resistance and rebellion, routes to freedom, and slave and free Black families. This readings-based course features both secondary and primary sources. Select primary documents will acquaint students with the sources historians use to reconstruct these aspects of the histories of largely non-literate African-descended peoples. Not offered 2025-26. Professor Lohse. Other years: Offered in Fall 2021 , Fall 2023 269 Early American Debates This course will examine the historic roots of some of the most pressing debates in American politics today. What did people in the revolutionary era really think about citizenship, colonization, democracy, disease, guns, equality, punishment, religion, reproduction, slavery, taxation, and violence? This fresh examination of the nation’s founding period draws heavily on primary sources such as diaries, newspapers, speeches, and pamphlets as well as innovative historical scholarship. Students will be challenged to consider both the power and limits of invoking the past as a political tool in the present. Includes class meetings in the Amherst College Archives and Special Collections and the Mead Art Museum. One class meeting per week. Limited to 20 students. Not offered 2025-26.

Can literature be a source for history? What happens to stories when they travel through time and space? Do myths migrate with people? We address these questions through the Ramayana, one of the most famous stories in the world. It is a fascinating tale of love, violence, exile, loss, and redemption known and loved by people in South and Southeast Asia and across the diaspora. This course begins with the oldest Ramayana story written two thousand years ago by Valmiki in Sanskrit. It then explores Ramayanas across time in Old Javanese, Hindi, and Tamil and as comic books, performances, films, and TV shows. This course ultimately draws attention to the global power of stories that animated the distant past and continue to enchant the present. Two meetings per week. Omitted 2025-26.

This 200-level survey is a history of the making of modern South Asia with a focus on India. Spanning the period from the sixteenth century to the present, the course introduces students to the history, politics, culture, and societies of the Indian sub-continent. It covers the consolidation of the Mughal empire, successor states in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, British imperial rule, resistance to colonialism, anti-colonial movements and political thought, decolonization in the subcontinent, postcolonial social movements, and the new rise of ethnic nationalism. The course outlines this long and complex history through themes including caste, labour, gender, the economy, and political thought and institutions. Two meetings per week. Not offered in 2025-26.

Questions about whether South Africans can move beyond the legacy of the past haunt the current population. New interpretations of South African history have emerged as new generations of historians write the past. This course will explore established and emerging themes in the history of this fascinating country. We will cover a broad period from just before the beginning of white settlement in the mid-1600s to the present. The focus will be on understanding how South African populations have confronted and engaged with colonial rule, profound cultural changes, and the development of an oppressively unequal economic and political system. What are the roots of the current situation, and how do they shape and constrain future possibilities? How do people in contemporary South Africa confront the ideas that have shaped their understanding of their own country as they reconstruct their history? Meets twice weekly. Not offered in 2025-26.

Art, trade, small-scale manufacturing, medical knowledge, religion, state systems, history, and legend all flourished before the formal political take-over of the continent by European powers in the late nineteenth century. We will explore this varied history of states and cultures in the African past. The course will focus primarily on the period between 1400 and 1885 by discussing four topics in depth: labor systems within African societies and the impact of both the trans-Atlantic and East African trades in enslaved people; the impacts of religion and political power on the rise and fall of the central African kingdom of Kongo; the genesis of the Zulu state in southern Africa and historical debates about the regional impact of the Zulu state’s expansion; and the changing roles of women as economic, political, and social actors. We will discuss differences between oral and written narratives to understand how Africans actively interpreted their histories and how later historians have re-interpreted, re-written, and occasionally silenced these earlier narratives.

It will explore political, military, social and cultural history. We will seek a better historical understanding of many of Israel’s ongoing challenges, such as the place of religion in civil life, the state’s relation to world Jewry, and the Arab-Israeli conflict. We will pay special attention to contested identities and inner debates within Zionism and Israel, highlighting different and occasionally opposing visions of a Jewish homeland. In addition to historical documents and books (non-fiction and fiction), we will rely on the growing wealth of Israeli documentary films. Not offered in 2025-26. Professor A.

It will assess the impact of global and regional wars on Great power diplomacy and their role in shaping the region and resolving its conflicts, from the demise of the Ottoman Empire to the emergence of the US as the dominant great power in the late 20 th century. It will examine how the Great Powers defined the area’s borders and peoples, and how their interests impacted on and were affected by the regions’ nationalisms, nation states, and local conflicts and collaborations. It will look at, inter alia: the post-WW1 Anglo-French regional carve up; the seeds of the Palestine/Israel conflict; WW2, US/Soviet competition and the Cold War; Suez, Nasserism and ‘positive neutrality’; the scramble for oil; the emergence of the US/Israeli strategic alliance; Iran, Turkey and the ‘periphery’; the US and the post-Soviet moment; and ISIS, Iraq and the new world order. Limited to 25 students. Spring semester. Professor Khalidi and Ghazarian. 301 Proseminar in History: Writing the Past This course offers an opportunity for history majors and students intrigued by the past to reflect upon the practice of history. How do we claim to know anything about the past at all? How do historians construct the stories they tell about the past from the fragmentary remnants of former times? What is the connection between the past as it was lived and the narratives that historians write? How do we judge the truth and value of these histories and memories? The course explores questions such as these through readings and case studies drawn from a variety of places and times. Throughout the semester, we will examine a variety of subjects, from the heroic yet complicated life of noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to the clashing worldviews of Hawai’ians and Europeans at the time of Captain Cook’s Pacific explorations, from debates over the motivations of perpetrators in the Holocaust to contrasting interpretations of Chinese footbinding. To be explicit, though: our object in reading these books is not to learn their subject matter. If you gain a better understanding of these historical events through our readings, great – but that is not the goal of the course. Rather, our aim is to study the discipline of History itself, looking closely at how the historians writing these texts tried to make and discover knowledge. This approach will allow us to grapple with a number of significant philosophical questions that still dominate the study of the past. Is there such a thing as historical truth? Is it appropriate for historians to have a political agenda? What does it mean for a history, or a historian, to be “biased”? To what extent is history a useful lens for understanding the present? Not open to first-year students. Limited to 25 students. Fall semester: Professor Manion. Spring semester: Professor Couvares. Other years: Offered in Fall 2011 , Spring 2012 , Spring 2013 , Fall 2013 , Spring 2014 , Fall 2014 , Spring 2015 , Fall 2015 , Spring 2016 , Fall 2016 , Spring 2017 , Fall 2017 , Spring 2018 , Fall 2018 , Spring 2019 , Fall 2019 , Spring 2020 , Fall 2020 , Spring 2021 , Fall 2021 , Spring 2022 , Fall 2022 , Spring 2023 , Fall 2023 , Spring 2024 , Fall 2024 , Spring 2025 , Fall 2025 310 History of Fascism (Offered as HIST 310 and EUST 310) Fascism emerged as a political ideology that was simultaneously revolutionary and reactionary, promising national rebirth in opposition to both liberalism and Marxist socialism. But after the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II, fascism seemingly ceased to be a factor in global politics. How do we assess fascism a century after the establishment of the first fascist regime in Italy? This course will explore the social, cultural, and intellectual origins of fascism, the rise of fascist movements in Europe in the early to mid-twentieth century, the politics and policies of fascist parties and regimes—including in Germany, Italy, Iberia, the Balkans, and the Baltic States—and transnational fascist links between Europe and the Americas, Asia, and Africa. This course will conclude with a consideration of anti-fascism and the \"fascism question\" in contemporary politics. Readings and course materials will be drawn from a variety of secondary and primary sources. Two meetings per week. Not offered in 2025-26. 2025-26: Not offered Other years: Offered in Spring 2011 , Spring 2022 312 History and Politics of Human Rights This course will introduce students to major philosophical roots, historical developments, and contemporary debates in human rights politics. The course will begin by examining the global historical evolution of human rights, exploring how philosophical developments and historical events influenced modern concepts. It will then examine the growth of international laws, institutions, and policies in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Finally, the course will explore human rights issues in contemporary politics. Throughout, we will trace the shifting boundaries and meanings of “human rights,” probe the divide between theory/recognition of rights and their realization, or lack thereof, and analyze the efficacy of instruments and institutions meant to secure those rights. Considerable weight and attention will be given to human rights issues in the context of the United States and its domestic and international politics. The universalizing nature of human rights and their global import, however, compels us to think beyond these cultural, political, and historical boundaries, and challenge assumptions about the meaning and form of universal rights. One class meeting per week. Not offered in 2025-26.

Which political issues have sparked student movements in the United States, and why? Why do some student movements succeed, why do others fail, and how might one define and evaluate the meaning of success? How have student movements in higher education and beyond changed over time? Centering the experience of African American learners, this course surveys the history of student activism for freedom and racial equality during Reconstruction and Jim Crow; the Civil Rights and Black Power Movement; and, the Movement for Black Lives. In particular, this course will explore how students have fought to secure freedom, equality, and citizenship through education. Students will also critically engage with how other social movements have influenced campus campaigns. Course materials include historical monographs, scholarly articles, primary sources, and video/audio media. Assignments likely include an exam, a book review, a research paper, and an oral presentation. One class meeting per week. Limited to 25 students. Not offered in 2025-26. Professor Bradley. 2025-26: Not offered Other years: Offered in Spring 2020 , Fall 2021 317 Curating the Premodern The medieval and early modern past is constantly being explored and reinterpreted, whether in the traditional realms of academia and the heritage industry or through film, TV, games, and even political protests. Despite this saturation of premodernity in modern culture, few opportunities exist for those outside the academy to consider how the premodern past is selectively shaped and communicated to the public. This course offers theoretical and practical takes on curating and curatorial practices in relation to art and objects produced during the medieval and early modern periods, making extensive use of the collection of the Frost Library Special Collections and Mead Art Museum. At the beginning of the semester, short lectures will be focused on introducing students to central aspects in curating and museum practices, such as collecting and conservation; installation and display; education; and documentation. As the semester progresses, we will transition to a discussion-based seminar focused on the practical elements of an exhibition: the interpretive plan, object list and labels, and educational panels. The course includes one field trip to a museum and culminates in the installation of an exhibition in the Frost Library. Meets once weekly. Instructor permission only. Spring semester. Professor Murrell. 318 Rap, Reagan and the 1980s Other years: Offered in Spring 2022 , Spring 2024 , Spring 2025 319 Religion, Empires, and Secular States (Offered as HIST 319, ASLC 320 and RELI 322.) Conceptions of the religious and the secular assumed global significance over the course of the nineteenth century. Legal and scholarly means to identify, compare, and regulate religion took shape as colonial empires and nascent nation-states sought to govern and integrate heterogeneous populations. Drawing on inter-disciplinary conversations, this course historicizes the categories of religion and secularity in order to consider their political and intellectual functions as they developed in the nineteenth century. The 1893 World Parliament of Religions will set the stage for a historiographic and theoretical engagement with topics such as the academic creation of “World Religions,” reappraisals of the secularization thesis, and the invocation of “religion” as an explanatory force in international relations and colonial encounters. Specific case studies will include Meiji Japan, as well as contemporary debates of secularism in France and India. Requirements include short writing assignments, web posts, a modest research paper, and a class presentation. Two meetings weekly. Not offered 2025-26.

Our guiding questions include: Why have different groups described the past in different ways—as lost or recoverable, dangerous or a teacher, determined or open to change? What mediums—from rocks to charts, songs to manuscripts, and isotopes to cities—contain history’s secrets and shape it? And how have cultures adapted their understanding of history to form new ways of living? Our exploration will be extensive, including the following case studies: how Charles Darwin’s reading of eighteenth century nautical charts and study of animal migrations led him to deny humanity’s ability to understand many aspects of Earth’s natural history; how studying fossilized footprints in the nineteenth century led Amherst’s Edward Hitchcock to re-evaluate humanity’s political and technological aspirations; and how the Wakuénai in South America, in the twentieth century, conceived antisocial travel as bridging oneself to ancient forces that could then affect present personalities. We also look at how producers of fiction from Hubert Robert to Steven Spielberg used expansive histories to elicit wonder in audiences. This course contains lectures, discussions, and hands-on interactions. The latter include organizing relics to affect our historical interpretations, learning to read geological history from “footmarks,” and searching for overlooked sources in archives. These abilities are refined through exams, essays, and a creative final-project.

Human histories have always intertwined with the histories of non-human animals, domesticated and wild. This course will discuss African animals as historical subjects, highlighting their connections to human societies and how animals have shaped these societies and entered into their cultural imaginings and economic endeavors. Specific topics will include the representations of specific animals, such as the eland and the jackal, in African art and folktales; the significance of domesticated animals, such as cattle, goats, dogs, and horses, to African economies and the development of states; hunting as an aspect of European empires in Africa; and the intersection of wildlife and environmental conservation with political movements and military conflicts. We will use historical sources and scholarly works from multiple disciplines to think through these complex interactions on the frontiers between societies and species. Two class meetings per week. Not offered 2025-26. Professor Redding. 2025-26: Not offered Other years: Offered in Fall 2024 326 Diamonds (Guns and Money): An African History of a Precious Commodity (Offered as HIST 326 and BLST 326) Diamonds have a long history in global trade; for centuries, they were scarce enough to be among the most precious commodities. But in 1867, the discovery of diamonds in a remote part of the Cape Colony in southern Africa turned them into a commodity that helped finance the construction of the British empire on the continent through conquest and African labor. The diamond industry that emerged also developed a mass retail market as the gem became a symbol of marital love and respectability, a marketing feat that masked the harsh realities of their production. More recent diamond discoveries in Africa and elsewhere have been implicated in enough revolts, secessionist movements, and arms deals to earn the label “conflict diamonds” for the gems coming out of those regions. We will trace the history of diamonds on the continent from their discoveries through the development of mining and labor systems, the creation of the global consumer market, and the use of diamonds as a source of revenue for aspiring empire-builders and revolutionaries.

In 2014-2015, young Black people in St. Louis and Ferguson rescued American democracy, and it scared the nation. Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb. Brown’s last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis. This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions: what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights? In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves. Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level. In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights. Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans. Meets twice weekly. Fall semester. Professor Bradley. Other years: Offered in Fall 2024 , Fall 2025 333 American Empire Is the United States an empire? Was the United States an empire? What does it mean to be an empire or to act imperially? And how has the United States’ relationship to these concepts and structures changed over time? This course uses the lens of empire and imperialism to examine the social, cultural, political, economic, and environmental history of the United States from the nation’s founding up to the present. Rather than focusing on traditional diplomatic relations or domestic political culture, it highlights the in-between spaces—western territories invaded by white settlers, overseas possessions annexed by war and declaration, and foreign countries subjected to the disproportionate influence of U.S. presence in their domestic affairs—to explore how American imperial power manifested, how those affected adapted to and resisted it, and how the legacies of this history continue through the present. Two class meetings per week. Not offered in 2025-26. 2025-26: Not offered Other years: Offered in Spring 2023 334 High Growth Japan as History (Offered as ASLC 334 and HIST 334.) Japan’s rise from the ashes of total defeat to become one of the largest and most prosperous economies in the world was once celebrated as the “Japanese miracle.” Focusing on the so-called high-growth period between the mid-1950s and mid-1990s, this course explores shifting historiographic approaches to postwar Japanese history, with a particular focus on the intersection of economic growth and democratic politics. Topics will include the place of Japan within the Cold War, the effects of economic growth on society and the environment, including social movements and intellectual responses to the changes wrought by high-growth. We will conclude by considering the legacy of high growth on Japan during the so-called “lost decades” that followed the bursting of the economic bubble. The course will entail short writing assignments and a historiographic research paper. Two class meetings per week. Fall semester. Professor Maxey. Other years: Offered in Fall 2025 336 Thatcher's Britain (Offered as HIST 336 and EUST 336.) As Prime Minister (1979-1990), Margaret Thatcher presided over a tumultuous and still deeply controversial era in British history. This course examines the key events of this decade, exploring the extent to which they constituted a “revolution” in British politics, society, and culture. Students will gain an understanding of the rise of neoliberalism and “Thatcherism” as an ideology and a set of policies that included privatization, free market economics, the attempted dismantling of the welfare state, and a renewed emphasis on personal responsibility. The course will also examine the opposition to these changes that arose from across British society, including from trade unions, the IRA, and the peace movement. Finally, students will consider the lasting effects of the Thatcher era in shaping the racial and class tensions that underlie Britain’s status as a post-imperial nation today. Course materials will predominantly focus on historical scholarship, but will also integrate the study of songs, memoirs, and films, both from the era and today. Not offered in 2025-26.

This course examines U.S. history—particularly the history of the South—during the era of Jim Crow, the period between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement when African Americans were systematically denied political and social rights. The right to vote, for example, granted after the Civil War through the Fifteenth Amendment, was limited by the southern states through policies like the poll tax and the literacy test. African Americans were also subject to segregation and racial violence during the age of Jim Crow. This course examines the visions white southerners held for what their region should be in this period, as well as the varied black responses—which include accommodationism (with Booker T. Washington as the most prominent advocate for this), protest, and migration out of the region. In examining the life and death of Jim Crow—and how Jim Crow has been depicted in literature and film—the course grapples with changing ideas about race and rights, including “states’ rights” and the rights of individuals, both black and white. Two meetings per week. Limited to 20 students. Not offered in 2025-26.

Many see today’s world resembling some features of the world in the 19th century. Unlike in the Cold War, there is no stability of two superpowers system. Like in the 19th century some powers today claim regional hegemony, attempt to pursue the course of supranationalism, and encounter the challenge of diversity. The course will explore the historical experience of the British, French, German, Habsburg, Ottoman, and Russian empires in the 19th century by focusing on how those imperial formations met the challenge of modernization and nationalism which included both accommodation of diversity and violent exclusion. Students will acquire the toolkit of comparative historical analysis and will focus on moments of interaction-entanglement of these imperial formations. Two meetings per week. Limited to 18 students. Spring semester. Professor Semyonov.

By contrast, students in this course will be asked to bring women, gender and sexuality from the margins to the center of Latin American history. In doing so, we will reevaluate four transformative historical moments: the Spanish conquest, the wars of independence, the emergence of industrial capitalism, and the proliferation of late twentieth-century political revolutions. Through an exploration of these key periods of upheaval we will assess how social conflict was frequently mediated through competing definitions of masculinity and femininity. In addition, this course will explore the ways in which women’s activism has been central to social and political movements across the continent. Furthermore, we will investigate how the domain of sexual practice and reproduction underpinned broader conflicts over racial purity, worker power, and the boundaries of citizenship in racially and ethnically diverse societies. The course will culminate in a final research paper on a topic chosen by the student. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 18 students.

Examining the Caribbean, Mesoamerican, Andean, and Amazonian regions, we will consider questions such as: What were the earliest cultures of the Americas like? How did civilizations such as the Maya, the Aztecs, and the Inca confront the unprecedented challenges of the conquest? How did indigenous peoples resist and forcibly adapt to centuries of Spanish and Portuguese colonialism? What roles did native peoples play in the new nations of the nineteenth century? How have indigenous peoples pursued their own struggles for citizenship in the face of threats to their autonomy and the environment? In a series of short writing assignments and a longer paper based on original research, students will explore secondary historiographies, analyze diverse primary sources, and discuss different historical methods in the study of the indigenous past and present.

Historians have taken many approaches to understanding its rise and the challenges to its ascendency. This course explores these interpretations, using an array of theories and case studies from around the globe. Participants will also investigate the ways that issues of class, race, gender, religion, and the environment have shaped these historical approaches, and we will speak with several of the historians whose works we read. Among the learning goals for the course is to help students evaluate the debates over how we understand the formation of our contemporary world. Enrollment capped at 24 to facilitate discussion.

The course will then follow the development of the peace process after 1967, highlighting the US’s preeminent role after the 1991 Madrid Peace conference and the significance of PLO’s push for a two-state solution after 1988. We will examine the background to the 1993 Oslo accords, as well as the failure of the negotiating process since, and end with an examination of the lessons of the past and the future of a potential settlement. Students will utilize a variety of primary and secondary materials and will also gain insights into the negotiating process from the instructor's own experience. Seminar format. One meeting per week.

What does it mean to talk of “Asia,” if the term itself is largely the product of modern imperialism and its attendant discursive formations? This seminar adopts Kuan-Hsing Chen’s framework of “Asia as Method” to combine post-colonial studies, critical area studies, and the emerging field of “Asian studies in Asia” to grapple with the intellectual history of East Asia from the late-nineteenth century onwards. Topics will include the legacy of pan-Asianist thought and movements, critiques of area studies in late-twentieth century American universities, resistance to the national form and the lingering effects of imperialism, and the role of global capitalism in driving cultural criticism in contemporary East Asia. Classes will combine close readings of texts, short writing assignments, and a modest individual research paper. Two meetings per week. Spring semester. Professor Maxey. 355 Race and Educational Opportunity in America (Offered as HIST-355, BLST-355 and EDST-355) This interdisciplinary seminar blends African American history; urban history; and the history of education to explore the relationship between race, schools, and inequality in American society. In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans’ educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality. We will focus on African Americans’ efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans’ legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans’ unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others. Course assignments will consist of weekly responses; two short papers; and one longer essay designed to allow students to delve into some aspect of the course in depth. This course can be used to complete the seminar requirement in History, upon consultation with the instructor. Fall semester. Limited to 18 students. Professor Moss.

It was also a decade fraught with contradictions. On the one hand, Americans experienced widespread disillusionment with the power of the federal government to promote and protect the minority from the majority. Historians seeking to understand the collapse of the welfare state or the origins of white resistance to civil rights’ initiatives most often point to the 1970s as the time when the Supreme Court abandoned school desegregation and the federal government shifted the burden of the social welfare system onto the market, state and local governments, and onto poor people themselves. And yet, the 1970s also saw an explosion of progressive social activism, as the women’s movement, the gay rights movement, and the environmental movement, among others, all came into their own. Likewise, this was also a time when U.S. realignment internationally and military overextension intersected with new hegemonies of human rights regimes, multinational corporations, and “globalization.” This course will emphasize a wide array of social movements and activism—both left and right—and the interplay among formal politics, grassroots organizing, and popular culture. It will ask students to consider how the 1970s catalyzed many of the domestic and international dynamics and debates that define American politics and society today. One class meeting weekly. In Fall 2022, this course will be offered at both Amherst and Williams College campuses. There will be an end of the semester symposium at Williams College that all enrolled students are required to attend as part of the final project. Limited to 15 students. Not offered in 2025-26.

We will begin by situating the late imperial Chinese economy in the global context and engaging rival scholarly approaches to the multifaceted debates over the ”Great Divergence” question: Why and when did China fall behind, while Western Europe embarked on a trajectory of modern economic growth? We will investigate several key issues, such as the imperial state’s role in the economy, China’s Malthusian crisis, the structure of the marketplace, the social status and life of merchants, the nature of Chinese entrepreneurship, the intersections between gender, family, and economic life, and China’s trade connections with the wider world. Students will learn significant scholarly approaches to socioeconomic history and learn to discuss and write historiographically. This course requires neither prior knowledge about Chinese history nor command of the Chinese language. This is a reading-intensive and writing-attentive course. We will read a significant number of monographs and scholarly essays, including both classic and contemporary works. Assignments include short response papers, in-class presentations, a book review, and a final essay. Students wishing to fulfill the seminar paper requirement may opt to write a research paper in place of the final essay. One meeting weekly. Not offered in 2025-26.

This class introduces students to the major historical scholarship and debates on state, society, and the family and kinship structures in China from the mid-seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century. The purpose of the course is to not only familiarize students with important issues in late imperial Chinese history but also engage them in representative work by successive generations of scholars in order to understand how historical interpretations (including theoretical orientations, methodology, and use of sources) have developed over time. We will focus on the following topics: the feature of the imperial state; the structure of local government and rural control; the law in society; heterodoxy, collective violence, and peasant rebellion; the evolution of the Chinese family and lineage system; gender and sexuality; the nature of the Chinese “gentry” and the foundations of their power; civil examination and elite reproduction; agrarian economy and city life. All of these topics have provoked intense debates and fostered an important and growing body of scholarship. Requirements include short response papers and topical essays. No prerequisite.

This seminar examines the role of various frontier regions and borderlands in the long span of Chinese history. Ever since ancient times, the development of agricultural communities, dynastic states, and Sinitic cultures in China was deeply intertwined with the fate of the societies on its borders, such as Mongolia, Manchuria, Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, and the mountainous southwestern regions. In this course, we will read both classic and cutting-edge scholarship on China’s frontier regions and critically engage a number of major historiographical issues in Chinese history, such as empire building, frontier expansion, borderland society, cross-cultural trade, environmental changes, the construction of ethnicity, and Chinese nationalism. At the end of the course, students will learn about the history of China’s frontier regions and gain deep insights into China’s persistent problems in its borderland areas. Some knowledge of Chinese history and culture is helpful but not necessary to do well in this course.

This course explores how history can be understood through sex, gender, and the body. The course focuses on South Asia as part of global history. We explore what relationship sex had with medieval politics. We analyze how colonialism and capitalism dominated people through disciplining bodies. Finally, we examine how nationalisms operate through gender. Throughout the course, we interpret a range of primary sources including poetry, maps, and films. Students will have the opportunity to do independent research by visiting the Amherst College Archives and Special Collections. Two meetings per week. Omitted 2025-26.

This seminar will explore the histories of transgender identities, activism, and communities around the world. Some questions to be engaged include: What concepts have been used to understand gender variant, expansive, and nonconforming people throughout history? How have war, violence, and legacies of colonialism, enslavement, and exploitation shaped the terms and conditions by which people of transgender experience and expression understood themselves and were perceived by others? How have transgender people advocated for self-determination, legal rights, and medical care? How has the transgender rights movement intersected with the civil, disability, women’s, and the LGBTQ rights movements? Students will work with primary sources such as newspaper accounts, legal codes, medical journals, religious texts, memoirs, and manifestos as well as pathbreaking historic studies of transgender people in China, England, Germany, Iran, Thailand, and the United States.

Reformers were determined to strengthen their countries’ sovereignty vis-à-vis increasingly aggressive European imperial powers and embarked on a series of measures designed to improve their economies, political institutions and militaries. Reformers were also concerned to generate a new public, and develop modern citizens imbued with new civic, political, literary and artistic sensibilities. Europe served as one important source of inspiration for Ottoman reformers. Reformers were in conversation with European modernity, even as they were in conversation with their own traditions. This course explores the complex relationship between preservation and change, between admiration and rejection, both of Ottoman and European ideas, institutions and cultures that characterized the nineteenth-century reform process. We will move beyond the oversimplification and distortion inherent in the paradigm of “adoption vs. rejection” and instead seek to conceptualize the complex relationship with Europe, and with the Ottomans’ own traditions, as a process of translation from the ‘traditional’ to the ‘modern.’ The course focusses on the construction of an Ottoman Modern through an examination of literature, art, ideas and institutions.

Using predominantly primary material, we will chart the emergence, success, and evolution of Islam, the Islamic community, and the Islamic polity. The focus of this course is on understanding the changing nature over time of peoples’ understanding of and conception of what Islam was and what Islam implied socially, religiously, culturally and politically. We concentrate on exploring the growth of the historical tradition of Islam and its continued contestations amongst scholars today. This course will familiarize students with the events, persons, ideas, texts and historical debates concerning this period. It is not a course on the religion or beliefs of Islam, but a historical deconstruction and analysis of the period. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 15 students. Not offered in 2025-26.

In Part 1, The Struggle for Palestine, 1936 simulation, students present arguments to the British \"Peel Commission\" regarding the Arabs’ and Jews’ respective needs and demands as they saw them at the time and learn about the origins of the conflict, and the various contacts between the parties and attempts at mediation from the early 1900s till the late 1940s. In Part II, student delegations examine proposals for a two-state solution beginning from the mid-seventies, as well as alternative visions of a one-state solution and/or other futuristic models. Different groups then put forward proposals based on these or their own ideas. \"Integrative Simulations\" are neither attempts at conflict resolution nor at finding an artificial middle ground between two asymmetric parties. They do not follow a \"Model UN\" or debate format. Rather, they are deep dives into the most difficult and intractable issues. Students will be asked to push beyond their comfort zones to develop an astute understanding of history and the political, strategic, and psychological underpinnings of the conflict. Students will engage in dynamic teamwork and be supported by the instructor as well as external \"coaches.\" Class meeting once per week. Fall semester. Co-taught by Natasha Gill and Ahmad Khalidi. Other years: Offered in Fall 2025 402 Wine, History and the Environment (Offered as HIST 402 and ENST 402.) Wine is as old as civilization, and is deeply wedded to religious and secular traditions around the world. Its production has transformed landscapes, ecosystems, and economies. In this course we examine how wine has shaped the history of Europe, North Africa, the Americas, and, increasingly, China. Through historical readings, scientific study, art, and class discussion, students will learn about such issues as the environmental impact of wine; the politics of taste and class; the organization of labor; the impact of imperialism and global trade; the late nineteenth-century phylloxera outbreak that almost destroyed the European wine industry; and the emergence of claims about terroir (the notion that each wine, like each culture, is uniquely tied to a place) and how such claims are anchored to regional and national identity. We will get our hands dirty with soil sampling, learn the basics of sediment analysis in the laboratory, and have a go at fermentation. Required field trips might include the taking of soil samples and planting of vines at Book and Plow Farm and a visit to a nearby winery. There also might be an optional multi-day oenology trip to New York’s Finger Lake district. Students who are using the course as their research seminar for History or LLAS will have one extra workshop each week to focus on the design and execution of an independent research project. Limited to 20 students. This is a research seminar open to juniors and seniors. Not offered in 2025-26.

Broadly we will learn about the treatment of people with disabilities, about the medical and social constructions of disability that have emerged in American society, and about key advocacy movements from the late 1800s to the twenty-first century. For example, we will examine the history of workers' compensation laws, accessibility design, and the American Disability Act. We will also tackle deeper questions such as: What is the historian’s responsibility to engage with disability? How does historical context impact how we define and perceive disability? And how can a historical perspective aid in disability advocacy? What responsibility do Americans have of learning about the lives that have become disabled, injured, and harmed overseas by US warfare? Since disability is not something that is experienced exactly the same way by everyone, this course will also examine the intersection of disability with the categories of race, gender, class, citizenship and sexuality. Students will do close analysis of historical evidence, including written documents, images, film, and newspapers. There will also be intensive in-class discussion and varying forms of written work, which will culminate in a final research paper on a topic chosen by the student. Two meetings per week. Omitted 2025-26. Professor Peralta. 2025-26: Not offered 404 Comparative School Choice: History and Policy (Offered as EDST 404 and HIST 404.) Relative to the U.S., Aotearoa New Zealand has been far more open to experimenting with choice-based educational policies within its public schools, particularly with respect to religion, Indigeneity, and the utilization and dismantling of school attendance zones. This research seminar explores the history of school choice in the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand in the late twentieth century. Students will research, explore, compare, and connect the history of school choice in the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand by considering choice-based policies including vouchers; de-zoning; \"controlled choice\"; and early charter initiatives derived from public-private partnerships. Among the questions we will consider: how did ideas about school choice circulate between educators and policy makers across the Pacific? What analytical understandings emerge about the purposes and possibilities of public education when one peers beyond the United States? What can Americans, particularly those concerned with equalizing educational opportunity, understand about the possibilities and pitfalls of public-choice initiatives that decouple educational access from a student's place of residence? How have African American and Indigenous parents, educators, and policy makers utilized school choice to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for their communities? And how and why have debates over school choice functioned as key sites for contesting citizenship, identity, language preservation, and belonging in these two different contexts? As this is a research seminar, students will conduct primary research on a topic related to this course. Those interested in Aotearoa New Zealand will have access to a curated archive of primary and secondary materials. Limited to 18 students. One class meeting per week. Spring semester.

It is a discipline that is invested in critiquing U.S. empire, white supremacy, and the Western academy by highlighting different historical actors and demonstrating different ways of approaching knowledge. Despite these pivotal conversations which have shaped the field for over the past two decades, the way that Asian American history has been taught is still through traditional conversations of belonging, racialization, and exclusionary laws that are heavily bound within the framework of the nation-state. This research seminar will examine a range of questions, problems and approaches that current scholars use in the field. We will examine new theories and methods in their historical context, and will analyze their impact on current understanding of Asian American history such as queer theory, transnationalism, and settler colonialism. Finally, the course will culminate in individual research projects based on theories and research methods learned in class. One meeting per week. Limited to 18 students. Not offered 2025-26.

Throughout the seminar we will consider how factors such as religion, marriage, age, status, and geographic region interacted with gender to shape the lived experiences of women. We will chart a course that traverses the divide between medieval and early modern, focusing also on how premodern realities contrast with (or resemble) their modern depictions. This research seminar will begin with a systematic exploration of prevailing methodologies (and their limitations) for analyses of premodern gender and power. From this foundation, we will explore a series of case studies that illuminate how women negotiated the limitations placed upon them to attain prominence and renown – or in some cases, notoriety – in the political and cultural spheres of a patriarchal world. The course will culminate in individual student research projects, consisting of a 25-page research paper. One class meeting per week. Note on enrollment: Not open to first-year students.

Each of these commodities represents a complex array of linkages among producers, consumers, and intermediaries over time and space. Readings draw upon the disciplines of history, ecology, anthropology, and geography to place these commodities in their social, environmental, and spatial contexts. One of our aims is to understand the changing roles of natural systems and the divisions of labor that underlie the long-term processes of globalization. One class meeting per week.

By positing a new form of human identity, it has liberated and enslaved, built and destroyed. Most importantly it persisted by presenting itself as a natural fact of human life. Studying nationalism, therefore, is an act of self-exploration, whether we regard ourselves as national or not. Yet, though nationalism has shaped the modern age, people strongly disagree on its most basic concepts: What are nations? When did they emerge? What is their future? This research seminar will begin with a systematic and comparative study of the key theories of nationalism, seeking to understand both their claims and historical contexts. From this theoretical foundation, the seminar will explore case studies from different epochs and continents. Further: more than focusing on nationalism’s impact on politics, our case studies will illustrate nationalism’s impact on gender norms and class, on religion and philosophy, on culture and the arts. Finally the course will culminate in individual student research projects, consisting of a 25-page research paper and a final presentation as part of a mini-conference event.

It shaped the ways in which states viewed their citizens, and citizens viewed their states. This research seminar explores the Cold War from US and Soviet perspectives as well as considers the experiences and influences of nations and people beyond the two superpowers, to understand how the global conflict shaped politics, culture, and economy. Focusing on the years between 1945 and 1990, we will explore the relationship between international affairs and domestic society. Further, the course will place considerable emphasis on the interactions between the Cold War conflict and the concurrent process of decolonization. Throughout the course, students will be introduced to current interpretative models and theoretical approaches dealing with the Cold War, as well as read key texts on how the Cold War shaped a range of developments in different societies across the globe. Along with examining the beginning of the Cold War and key conflicts in Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam, we will consider the Cold War’s domestic manifestations in the United States, Soviet Union and beyond. This course provides students with an opportunity to develop and execute a research project of their own design. Students will pursue the project and write a 20-25 page research paper satisfying the History Department research paper requirement. Fall Semester. Professor Walker and Professor Glebov.

Traditionally, the modern concept of citizenship is tied to democratic government, that is, to participation in government, and, implicitly, to the nation-state. But when one travels overseas, it becomes immediately obvious that there is another meaning of citizenship aiming at regulating the boundary between “nationals” and “foreigners.” Before the second half of the twentieth century the global map featured more imperial states than nation-states. Those imperial states regulated the population’s rights and obligations and differentiated between foreigners and citizens. This course will explore the evolution of citizenship in the region of Eurasia from the Russian Empire to the post-Soviet period. It will focus on the concept of imperial citizenship as it pertained to the allocation of collective and individual rights to a religiously and confessionally heterogenous population and regulated the national and supranational political belonging. Contemporary societies may learn a lesson from the history of imperial citizenship in Eurasia as they face the challenges of diversity coming from global entanglement, migration flows, and new claims of collective cultural rights. The historical perspective on the history of citizenship in the region of Eurasia will also help us understand the post-imperial trajectories of political loyalty in present day former Soviet spaces that are ridden with multiple conflicts and the ongoing war in Ukraine.

Following Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms, the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, putting an end to the Communist experiment in Eurasia and to the Cold War. This momentous and defining event was the outcome of different historical processes, the fall of the Communist Party rule, the collapse of the command economy, and the disintegration of the Soviet multiethnic state under the pressures of nationalism. In this research seminar, students will explore social, political, and cultural forces that shaped the end of the Soviet Union and study the impact of the Soviet collapse on the post-Soviet developments. Using a range of primary and secondary sources, students will develop and execute independent research projects focusing on the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the legacies of this historical moment in Eurasia and the world. Student research will result in a 25 page research paper. One meeting per week. Limited to 18 students. Not offered 2025-26.

Rather than referring to damages paid by states to other states (by defeated to victorious powers), the term came to mean damages paid by states to groups of individuals wronged within their own polities. This seminar will explore a variety of reparations programs, both those implemented and those demanded. Cases will include reparations programs for the Holocaust and the confinement of Japanese Americans during World War II, as well as municipal reparations programs designed to address housing discrimination against Black Americans. In addition, the class will explore demands for reparations to Black Americans stemming from slavery, Jim Crow, and more recent discrimination; and those raised by former colonies against past imperial powers. Throughout, we will explore general questions: Can reparations ever make good the harm done? What makes for more and less efficacious reparations programs? Has the quest for reparations come to substitute for other more utopian visions of society? Students will write a 20-25 page research paper based on primary sources on any topic related to reparations, including cases of and/or movements for reparations not otherwise studied in the seminar. One meeting per week. Limited to 15 students. Spring semester. Professor Epstein. 436 Race, Gender, and Sexuality in U.S. History (Offered as HIST 436and SWAG 436) This course introduces students to critical theories of difference in thinking and writing about the past. We will read major works that chart the history of the very concepts of race, gender, and sexuality. We will explore how these ideas were both advanced and contested by various groups over the years by reading primary sources such as newspaper articles, personal letters, court records, and organizational papers. Movements for women’s rights, racial justice, and LGBTQ liberation have dramatically shaped these debates and their implications. In particular, feminist theory, critical race theory, and queer theory provide powerful arguments about how we formulate research questions, what constitutes a legitimate archive, and why writing history matters. Students will learn to identify and work with an archive to craft a major research paper in some aspect of U.S. history while engaging the relevant historic arguments about race, gender, and/or sexuality. Limited to 18 students. Not offered in 2025-26.

The majority of postwar migrants came from territories within the British Empire, particularly the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. As British imperial subjects, these people – known as Commonwealth Citizens – held full rights to live, work, vote, and receive welfare provision in the U.K. In spite of this formal political equality, Commonwealth Citizens experienced various kinds of official and unofficial racism upon arrival in Britain. They were frequently – if erroneously – represented as “foreigners” who took jobs, housing, and benefits from white Britons. Changes in immigration law throughout the 1960s and 1970s cemented this tendency to define Commonwealth Citizens as outsiders. This trend culminated in the 2018 “Windrush scandal,” in which thousands of Britons of color, all of whom had been legally living in the U.K. for decades, were detained, denied legal rights, and some wrongfully deported. This course explores the postwar experience of Commonwealth Citizens through the theme of risk. Structural racism in various realms of British society – from housing and employment to policing, education, and the media – all served to amplify migrants’ economic and social precarity. How did Commonwealth Citizens negotiate these risks? What forms of political, social, and cultural organizing helped them build community, claim belonging, and increase individual and familial security? To what extent did this activism transform migrant lives and communities, as well as British society more generally? This is a research seminar; throughout the semester, students will pursue individual research projects and write a 20-25 page paper on a topic of their choice. Limited to 18 students.

How did various historical actors (from medieval Mongols to modern colonial settlers to nationalists and Communists) decide to remove – and sometimes exterminate – entire peoples? Did ethnic cleansing exist throughout human history, or is it a distinctly modern phenomenon? How did specific historical processes, such as settler colonialism, state and nation-building, ideological and military conflicts contribute to ethnic cleansing? Finally, what is the relationship between modern human sciences and population politics and ethnic cleansing? This research seminar will explore different instances of ethnic cleansing and discuss under what circumstances peoples are unmixed. We will study a variety of materials, such as witness accounts, victim and perpetrator narratives, official reports, as well as analytical and historical studies of ethnic cleansing. Each student will select a case study and write a research paper of 25 pages. Limited to 18 students. Not offered in 2025-26.

Following 1954’s Brown vs Board of Education decision, a diverse social movement of students, preachers, working people, activists and intellectuals challenged—and eventually dismantled—Jim Crow segregation in the American South. How did this happen? To answer this question, we will examine the origins of the movement, its institutional dimensions, its key figures, and its intellectual underpinnings. In addition, this course will trace the afterlife of the movement, assessing its national and global reverberations, as well as its relationship to the Black Power movement. As a research seminar, this course will culminate in the production of a 25-page research paper based on an analysis of primary sources related to the movement. One class meeting per week. Not open to first-year students. Limited to 18 students. Not offered in 2025-26.

It will examine U.S. policy in the context of Cold War foreign relations and how U.S. policy responded to the decolonizing Third World and the perceived danger of communist expansion and control in Southeast Asia. The seminar will explore the various pressures and influences on American policymakers, the nature of the war, and its effects on Vietnam and the United States. It will also stress Vietnamese perspectives on the conflict and analyze how Vietnamese history and culture shaped interactions with the United States, the Soviet Union and the global community. Finally, the course will spend significant time on the conflict's broad impact on U.S. society and popular culture, as manifested through music, film, and literature. One class meeting per week.

Shanghai was the largest treaty port with the first foreign concessions in China, and thus emerged as the primary conduit for western ideas and culture. It witnessed the rise of China’s first bourgeoisie and urban middle class, and along with them, a modern consumer culture, popular media, modern aesthetics and new forms of art. It was also the origin of the workers’ movement and communist revolution and where the Chinese Communist Party held its first meetings. During the Mao era, Shanghai was not only the preeminent industrial city in the country, but also a major political center where the cultural revolution was plotted. Thanks to its key role in China’s modernity, the history of Shanghai has generated a substantial and impressive body of scholarship over the past few decades. In this research seminar, we will examine the various scholarly approaches to Shanghai’s history and grapple with a number of important theoretical and historiographic issues that are central to the study of modern Chinese history. In this seminar, we will develop research and writing skills in order to conduct a research project. This course requires some familiarity with modern Chinese history, but command of Chinese language is not necessary. Assignments include research exercises, short response papers, presentations, a research prospectus, and a final paper. Students wishing to fulfill the seminar paper requirement may opt to write a research paper. One class meeting per week. Limited to 18 students. Not open to first-year students. Spring semester. Professor Qiao. Other years: Offered in Spring 2013 471 Market, Capital, and Business Institutions in Traditional China (Offered as HIST 471 and ASLC 471.) In this course, we will explore the development of markets in premodern China and examine the methodologies of socioeconomic history. Our focus will be on critically engaging with exemplary scholarship on key topics in Chinese history, including the role of the state in the economy, the question of capitalism, business institutions, commercial networks, merchants and entrepreneurship, market structures, the peasant economy, frontier commerce, and the “great divergence” between China and Europe. We will also work on analyzing primary sources and employing them to construct historical narratives. Designed as a research seminar, this course aims to help students develop essential research skills in history. No knowledge of Chinese is required, and there are no prerequisites. This course meets once a week. Limited to 18 students. Omitted 2025-26.

This seminar examines how the experience of war during the 1930s and 40s are captured in the memory and history of Japan, East Asia, and the United States. The principal questions guiding our discussions will be: What is the relationship between history and memory in our media-saturated world? How are the memory and history of war intertwined in both national and international politics? What forms of memory have been included and excluded from dominant historical narratives and commemorative devices? What role can the academic discipline of history play in these controversies? The goal of the seminar will be to immerse ourselves in a critical conversation and to produce self-directed research projects. This is a research seminar that will combine historiographic readings and discussions with assignments designed to help students define and execute their own research project which will culminate in a 20-25 page evidence-based paper. Limited to 18 students. Not open to first-year students. Fall semester. Professor Maxey. Other years: Offered in Fall 2014 , Fall 2025 488 Riot and Rebellion in Colonial and Post-Colonial Africa (Offered as HIST 488 and BLST 321 [A]) There were numerous rebellions in Africa during the colonial period and violent resistance to state authority has continued to characterize political life in many post-colonial African countries. We will look at the economic, social, religious, and political roots of these disturbances. Rebel groups and state forces roiled societies and reconstituted social identities, while legends and rumors swirled around rebellions and their leaders. We will focus on insurgencies and their origins, including spiritual and religious beliefs, disputes over land and labor, and fights against colonial and post-colonial authoritarian states. We will also discuss the problems historians face in researching revolts whose strengths often stemmed from their protean characters. The seminar will study specific revolts, including the Herero Revolt and subsequent genocides in German-controlled South-West Africa in 1904-1907; the first (1896-1897) and second (1960-1979) Chimurengas (revolts) in Southern Rhodesia/Zimbabwe; the Chilembwe Revolt in Malawi in 1915; the Black Consciousness Movement and the student revolt in Soweto, South Africa in 1976; the roles of child soldiers and youth in post-colonial conflicts, and the Holy Spirit Movement and the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda. Students will complete a 20 to 25 page research paper on individually chosen topics relating to revolts in Africa. Two class meetings per week. Limited to 18 students.

As a national hero and Turkey’s first President from 1923 until his death in 1938, Ataturk symbolizes a shift from empire to republic, from subject to citizen. He is remembered for promoting the secularization, democratization and Westernization of Turkey. Turkey’s current President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has now served as head of the Turkish Republic for nearly as long as Ataturk. Supporters point to Erdogan's policies of democratization as the fulfillment of Ataturk’s intentions, while his opponents argue that Erdogan is deliberately dismantling the foundations of Ataturk’s secular and western-oriented republic. This seminar focuses on how these two leaders are variously imagined and claimed, as a window onto contemporary debates surrounding secularism and the place of religion, nationalism and minority rights, the tensions between authoritarianism and democracy, and the ways in which competing visions of the Ottoman past surround alternative constructions of Turkey’s future.
