All Hi! I just got accepted into Rice and Amherst College as an international student (junior year, linguistics major (hoping to focus more on psycholinguistics in the future). I’m super torn between the two because both are wonderful schools in different ways. My interest in linguistics (the linguistic topics that originally drove me into the field) requires combining psychology, cog sci, psychoanalysis, philosophy, and more (at least that’s how I hope to approach the subject). I also love visual arts, Chinese traditional art, classical music, and just art in general. I’m looking for a place that: 1. offers courses on most of the above-mentioned fields. 2. has enough research opportunities for undergrads 3. provides more support and guidance on future career planning 4. has a great and tight community 5. cares about its student’s wellbeing (cause that’s what my current school really lacks) I need to make a decision very soon and would really appreciate some advice and insights. Based on what I look for in a school and my future plans (which is not super clear, hence the tough decision), here’s a list of the pros and cons of each school: Rice: Pros: Has a linguistics department, though the course offerings are a bit limited (compared to other STEM majors at Rice) Plenty of research opportunities Easier to double a STEM major (I might want to pair cog sci or computer science with linguistics) Able to graduate on time in 2027 May if I took a full summer semester Great community and support, people here seem happy Great music department and art resources All the resources and opportunities Houston has to offer I’m getting entrepreneurship vibes on campus, which I appreciate More well-rounded overall I like owls…if that counts Cons: I’m from the north north, so the warm and humid weather is a concern for me I spent some years in the east coast and is more familiar with the general area I’m an introvert in general (and also neurodivergent) so some school traditions might be a bit overwhelming for me. Though it might be a different thing to actually experience them. Doesn’t seem to have courses in psychoanalysis or any course that touches on the more philosophical/ fuzzy/ abstract aspects of language and mind. Amherst College: Pros: So many interesting courses in philosophy (the one course in Wittgenstein offered next semester! I’ve been looking for that everywhere) and some in psychoanalysis and literature as well Love the quiet small college town, the hills the trees the animals, all the sceneries. The weather is also better for me, personally speaking The overall curriculum and course description feels very revolutionary I like seminars/ seminar-style courses The five-college consortium offers very niche language courses that can’t be find elsewhere Offers financial aid (though I assume I won’t be getting much) Cons: No linguistics major at all! I could do a computer science/ neuroscience major instead and take some linguistic courses at UMass (which has a great linguistics program), but I wouldn’t be able to get a Bachelor’s degree in linguistics, if I’m understanding it correctly. I plan to apply Phd in psycholinguistics/ linguistics in general and I don’t how much that’s going to affect my application Very few research opportunities compared to Rice Professors are great instructors but might not be as impactful in their respective fields as profs at research institutions Fewer discussions and resources on job opportunities/ future career paths. I get that, and correct me if I’m wrong, Amherst College has a great Alumni network but it works mostly for people in the pre-med/ pre-law/ consulting track, which is not the case for me. Most people in my country do not know anything about Amherst College, which I personally do not care, but it’s a concern for my parents so it’s a concern for me since they are the ones that pay my tuition fees. No summer semesters so I won’t be able to graduate on time (gonna have to spend one more semester) Sorry for the super long post. For a quick summary, I feel that Rice is more well-rounded and has more opportunities/ flexibility overall, but lacks some of the really niche stuff I really look forward to discussing with people. Amherst vibes with me really well but unfortunately does not have a linguistics program and overall feels like a utopia for me, one that I would really enjoy while I’m there but would be hit hard by the reality once I graduate. At this point I really need to hear some insider’s experience on attending/ choosing between a top LAC and a t20 university, and any other advice would also be greatly appreciated! (My info comes mostly from school websites, my friends, and past reddit posts. I do not directly know anyone from these schools, so please correct me if I’m wrong about anything) Thank you!
