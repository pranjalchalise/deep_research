An example of a web site video having the problem is https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/guide/osteoporosis-exercise When I right click on the video it is call for an Akamai Adaptive Media Player. Both of my Win 11 PCs do not have the Akamai Adaptive Media Player installed but yet runs fine on 1 PC. It appears that to download Akamai Adaptive Media Player it has a cost which I am not interested in paying.

I'm Greg, 10 years awarded Windows MVP, here to help you. No video appears anywhere on that page you linked. Do I need to click a link there? In any case it's a browser issue as web pages must use embedded players in the browser itself, not Windows players which don't respond to web page links unless they are downloaded first and then directed to the player. You could try another browser. If that doesn't work then since you now the player you can try to install it as a website extension explained here: http://www.yourtechtamer.com/blog/2017/01/what-... You can also ask the webmaster of the website, as they should not expect users to ever have to go find players to see their content, it should be embeddded in the page code to pop up and pay without effort. If you can direct me to the video I can research it more. Feel free to ask back any questions. Based on the results you post back I may have other suggestions if necessary. ______________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

They both had hardware acceleration on, so I turned it off and relaunced on the one not working. It did not fix the issue. I then deleted all browsing data (for all time) and relaunched but again problem not solved Please sign in to rate this answer.
