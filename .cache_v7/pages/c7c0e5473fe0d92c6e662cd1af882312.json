  "data": "Fact-checked by Grok 3 weeks ago Claudiu Keșerü Claudiu Andrei Keșerü (born 2 December 1986) is a Romanian former professional footballer who played as a striker, known for his prolific goal-scoring in multiple European leagues. [1] Over a career spanning more than two decades, he represented clubs in Romania , France , Qatar , and Bulgaria , amassing over 500 appearances and more than 250 goals across domestic competitions. [2] Internationally, Keșerü earned 46 caps for the Romania national team between 2013 and 2021, scoring 13 goals, including several in UEFA European Championship qualifiers. [3] Keșerü began his professional career with FC Bihor Oradea in 2003 before moving to France, where he spent nearly a decade with clubs including Nantes , Angers , and Bastia , playing over 150 matches in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. [2] In 2014, he returned to Romania with FCSB (formerly Steaua București), where he won the Liga I title and the Romanian Cup in his debut season, highlighted by a remarkable feat of scoring all six goals in a single league match against CS Pandurii Târgu Jiu —a first in the club's history. [4] He briefly played in Qatar with Al-Gharafa in 2015 before joining Bulgarian side Ludogorets Razgrad , where he enjoyed his most successful period, winning six consecutive Parva Liga titles from 2016 to 2021 and being named the league's top scorer twice (2016–17 and 2020–21) with 119 goals in 184 appearances. [5] Later stints included returns to FCSB and UTA Arad in Romania , followed by a brief comeback with Cherno More Varna in Bulgaria in 2024, before retiring on 1 January 2025. [2] Since retirement, Keșerü has transitioned into football administration as the sporting director for Liga II club FC Bihor Oradea. [1] Club career Bihor Oradea Claudiu Andrei Keșerü was born on 2 December 1986 in Oradea , Romania , where he developed an early interest in football through participation in local youth programs. [1] As a promising young talent from the region, he joined the youth setup of hometown club FC Bihor Oradea around 2002, honing his skills as a forward in the club's academy system. [1] Keșerü made his professional debut for FC Bihor Oradea during the 2002–03 Liga II season at the age of 16, becoming one of the club's emerging prospects in Romania's second division. [6] Over the course of that campaign, he featured in 15 appearances and netted 3 goals, demonstrating his potential as a goal-scoring threat early in his senior career. [7] A notable highlight was scoring his first senior goal, which underscored his rapid progression from youth ranks to contributing meaningfully in competitive matches. [7] In the summer of 2003, following Bihor's promotion to Liga I, Keșerü transferred to French club FC Nantes for a fee of €300,000, ending his initial stint at his formative club and launching his professional journey abroad. [6] This move represented the start of his adaptation to higher-level European football. [6] Nantes Keșerü joined FC Nantes in August 2003 at the age of 16, transferring from FC Bihor Oradea in Romania for a fee of €300,000. [8] Upon arrival, he was initially integrated into the club's reserve team, where he adapted to the professional environment under the guidance of staff including Serge Le Dizet and Jacky Soulard, though he faced personal challenges such as homesickness during his early months in France. [9] By the 2004–05 season, he earned promotion to the first-team squad, marking the beginning of his involvement in competitive matches for the senior side. Keșerü made his Ligue 1 debut for Nantes during the 2003–04 season, though he saw limited minutes initially; his first start came on 22 January 2005 against Rennes , where he scored the opening goal in a 2–0 victory with a lob over goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson . [9] Over the course of his tenure from 2003 to 2010, he accumulated 98 appearances across all competitions in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 , netting 16 goals, with notable contributions including a goal in a 1–1 draw against Saint-Étienne on 15 October 2005. [10] The 2006–07 season proved particularly challenging, as Nantes finished 20th in Ligue 1 and suffered relegation to Ligue 2 after 44 consecutive years in the top flight, despite Keșerü's efforts in 22 league appearances that year. [11] Keșerü's opportunities for consistent starting roles were hampered by strong competition from established strikers such as Nicolas Gillet and Marama Vahirua , leading to irregular playing time and periods on the bench during key seasons like 2004–05 (when Nantes finished 15th) and 2005–06 (15th place). [9] [12] He later reflected on his stubborn attitude as a young player, admitting it sometimes prevented him from fully absorbing advice from veterans like Mickaël Landreau . [9] Following Nantes ' promotion back to Ligue 1 at the end of the 2007–08 season, Keșerü remained with the club until July 2010, when he departed permanently on a free transfer to Angers SCO in Ligue 2. Angers In the summer of 2010, Claudiu Keșerü joined Angers SCO on loan from FC Nantes , marking a significant step in his career after limited opportunities in Ligue 1 . [6] During the 2010–11 Ligue 2 season, he appeared in 35 league matches, scoring 10 goals and providing 7 assists, which helped Angers finish fifth and reach the promotion playoffs, where they were eliminated by Dijon FCO . [13] His performances demonstrated growing consistency as a forward, building on the resilience gained from earlier challenges at Nantes . Keșerü's loan was converted to a permanent transfer in June 2011 for a reported fee of €1.5 million. [14] Over the next two seasons, he continued to develop as a reliable goalscorer in the second tier. In 2011–12, he played 33 league games, netting 6 goals and contributing to Angers ' mid-table finish. The 2012–13 campaign represented his peak at the club, with 17 goals in 32 Ligue 2 appearances, tying him for fourth in the league's scoring charts behind Mustapha Yatabaré's 23 goals. [15] His contributions were vital in securing Angers ' survival, as the team ended 16th and avoided relegation by six points. [16] A highlight of the 2012–13 season was Keșerü's hat-trick in a 3–1 home victory over Le Mans on 29 March 2013, which boosted Angers ' position in the relegation battle. [17] Across all competitions from 2010 to 2013, he recorded 33 goals in 100 appearances for Angers , establishing himself as a key attacking threat in Ligue 2. Keșerü departed the club in the summer of 2013, signing a two-year contract with SC Bastia in Ligue 1. [18] Bastia In the summer of 2013, Keșerü joined SC Bastia on a free transfer from Angers SCO . [6] During the 2013–14 Ligue 1 season, he made 17 appearances for the club, scoring just one goal and providing two assists while accumulating 712 minutes on the pitch. His time at Bastia was marked by limited opportunities, with only eight starts under coach Frédéric Hantz, as he struggled to secure a regular place in the lineup despite his prolific form at Angers the previous season. [19] Keșerü departed the club in January 2014 after six months, citing insufficient playing time as a key factor in his decision to return to Romania amid interest from FCSB . [19] FCSB Claudiu Keșerü joined FCSB (formerly Steaua București) on a free transfer from SC Bastia in January 2014. This move marked his return to Romanian football after mixed experiences in France , where his prior Ligue 1 stints helped him adapt quickly to the domestic pace and physicality. In his first half-season, he quickly integrated into the squad, contributing to the team's offensive surge. During the 2014–15 season, Keșerü made 34 appearances across all competitions, scoring 20 goals and establishing himself as a prolific forward. His standout performance came on 15 August 2014, when he netted all six goals in a 6–0 Liga I victory over CS Pandurii Târgu Jiu , a first in the club's history. This feat not only highlighted his finishing prowess but also propelled the team toward a dominant campaign. Keșerü played a pivotal role in FCSB's 2014–15 Liga I title win, finishing as the league's top scorer with 22 goals, and their Romanian Cup triumph, where he scored crucial goals in knockout stages. His effective partnerships, particularly with winger Alexandru Chipciu, created numerous scoring opportunities through coordinated attacks and overlapping runs. Following a successful 2014–15 season, Keșerü transferred to Al-Gharafa in Qatar in February 2015, leaving behind a legacy of domestic dominance. Al-Gharafa In February 2015, Claudiu Keșerü transferred from FCSB to Al-Gharafa in the Qatar Stars League for a reported fee of €2.4 million. [20] His impressive goalscoring form at FCSB, where he had scored 20 goals in 34 league appearances during the 2014–15 season, drew the interest of the Qatari club seeking to bolster their attack. Keșerü quickly made an impact, featuring in 9 league matches and scoring 9 goals before the end of the 2014–15 season. [21] A highlight was his four-goal haul in a 7–0 rout of Al Shamal on 21 March 2015, which elevated his tally to 7 goals after just 6 starts and helped Al-Gharafa secure a mid-table finish of 7th place. [22] Despite this productive spell, Keșerü's stint proved brief, as his contract was mutually terminated in August 2015, paving the way for a move to Ludogorets Razgrad. Ludogorets Razgrad Claudiu Keșerü joined Ludogorets Razgrad from Al-Gharafa on August 13, 2015, signing a three-year contract for a transfer fee of €1 million. [23] [24] Over the course of his tenure from 2015 to 2021, he made 243 appearances across all competitions, scoring 139 goals and providing 44 assists, establishing himself as the club's all-time leading scorer. [10] In the Bulgarian First League (Parva Liga), he amassed 119 goals in 184 matches, becoming the most prolific foreign player in the competition's history. [10] His arrival bolstered Ludogorets' attack during a dominant era, contributing to six consecutive league titles from the 2015–16 to 2020–21 seasons. [25] Keșerü's individual brilliance shone in the Parva Liga, where he claimed the top scorer title in the 2016–17 season with 22 goals and in 2020–21 with 22 goals, while finishing second in 2017–18 (24 goals) and 2018–19 (20 goals). These performances were instrumental in Ludogorets' sustained supremacy, as the club secured the championship each year Keșerü was a key starter, often leading the line with clinical finishing and aerial prowess. His experience from Romania's UEFA Euro 2016 campaign further enhanced his composure in high-stakes matches. [25] In European competitions, Keșerü provided memorable moments, including a goal in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League group stage against Arsenal , where he put Ludogorets 2–0 up in a 2–3 home defeat on November 1, 2016. [26] Overall, he scored 16 goals in UEFA club competitions during his time at Ludogorets, with notable contributions in Champions League qualifiers and Europa League group stages. [10] His departure came on August 27, 2021, when the club and player mutually agreed to terminate his contract ahead of its expiry. [27] Return to FCSB In the summer of 2021, following the termination of his contract with Ludogorets Razgrad, Claudiu Keșerü rejoined FCSB on a free transfer, signing a deal until June 2023; his strong scoring record in Bulgaria , where he became the foreign player with the most goals in the league's history, made him a high-profile addition to the squad. [28] [1] During the 2021–22 season, Keșerü featured in 19 Liga I matches for FCSB , starting 10 and scoring 5 goals, primarily in the first half of the campaign before his involvement diminished. [29] His contributions helped FCSB secure second place in the league, though the team fell short of the title. Tensions arose in early 2022 when Keșerü publicly expressed frustration over limited playing time and tactical decisions under coach Anton Petrea, leading to a heated exchange with club owner Gigi Becali ; Becali criticized Keșerü's form and level, benching him and excluding him from several match squads, including the February loss to Academica Clinceni. [30] [31] Becali stated that Keșerü could no longer perform at the top level and suggested he move to a lesser club, escalating the dispute into public declarations of departure. The conflict culminated in Keșerü's free transfer to UTA Arad in June 2022, after which his FCSB contract was mutually terminated in August 2023 upon its expiration, ending his second stint at the club with limited overall impact amid the ongoing disputes. [14] UTA Arad Following his departure from FCSB , Keșerü signed a two-year contract with fellow Liga I club UTA Arad as a free agent on 30 June 2022, marking a low-key return to the western Romanian region near his hometown of Oradea . [6] In the 2022–23 Liga I season, Keșerü featured in 26 league matches for UTA Arad, scoring 3 goals, while adding 7 appearances and 3 goals in domestic cup competitions, for a total of 33 outings and 6 goals across all competitions. [29] [10] His contributions, including timely goals during the play-out phase, supported the team's survival efforts, as UTA Arad finished 13th overall with 39 points and avoided relegation. [32] [33] Keșerü's experience as a veteran striker allowed him to mentor younger squad members amid the club's push for stability in the top flight. The move emphasized a regional homecoming over high-stakes competition, aligning with his desire for proximity to family and roots after a demanding career abroad. His contract was mutually terminated in August 2023, resulting in his release as a free agent , after which he transitioned to Cherno More Varna. [6] Cherno More Varna In August 2024, Claudiu Keșerü joined Cherno More Varna on a one-year contract as a free agent following his stint at UTA Arad, marking his return to Bulgarian football after nearly a decade away. The 37-year-old Romanian striker quickly integrated into the squad , providing experience and leadership during Cherno More's competitive campaign in the First Professional League, where the team challenged for the title alongside Ludogorets Razgrad and Levski Sofia. [34] During the 2024–25 season, Keșerü made 15 appearances in the league, scoring 6 goals, including notable strikes against rivals Levski Sofia that contributed to key draws in the title race. [35] His role as a veteran forward extended beyond scoring, as he mentored younger players and helped stabilize the attack in a side that finished as runners-up the previous season, emphasizing tactical discipline and set-piece contributions. Keșerü announced his retirement in December 2024 at age 38, shortly after a 4–0 league win over Lokomotiv Sofia where he scored twice, citing the physical demands of professional football as a primary factor in his decision to step away. [36] His farewell match came on December 14, 2024, in the Bulgarian Cup against Slavia Sofia, where he entered as a substitute and scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory, advancing Cherno More to the quarter-finals and capping his career with an emotional send-off from teammates and fans. [37] Retirement Claudiu Keșerü officially retired from professional football on December 31, 2024, upon the expiry of his contract with Cherno More Varna. [1] This marked his second retirement announcement, following an initial one in 2023 after departing UTA Arad, though he briefly returned to play for Cherno More in the 2024–25 season. [38] In the immediate aftermath, Keșerü reflected on his time at Cherno More, where he appeared in 15 matches, scoring 6 goals and providing 2 assists over 4.5 months. [39] He bid farewell in his final match on December 14, 2024, scoring the winning goal in a 1–0 Bulgarian Cup victory over Slavia Sofia, and expressed gratitude to the fans and teammates for their support, stating, \"I gave everything I had.\" [37] [39] Among his career highlights, he noted recently scoring in six consecutive matches and receiving the AFAN career award at the Gala Premiilor AFAN. [38] Keșerü expressed some regrets, particularly the \"bitter taste\" of leaving UTA Arad, which motivated his strong performance in Varna to reaffirm his abilities. [38] Regarding limited international success, he had previously highlighted frustrations with Romania 's national team campaigns, though his overall career spanned multiple leagues and included significant achievements like multiple league titles in Romania and Bulgaria . Following retirement, Keșerü became the sporting director for Liga II club FC Bihor Oradea in January 2025. [40] International career Early caps (2013–2015) Claudiu Keșerü earned his first call-up to the Romania senior national team in 2013, propelled by his strong goalscoring form at Angers SCO , where he netted 17 goals in the 2012–13 Ligue 2 season. Under head coach Victor Pițurcă , who had taken charge in 2011, Keșerü was selected to bolster the attack during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. He made his debut on 11 October 2013 in a 4–0 away victory over Andorra , entering as a substitute and scoring Romania's second goal with a header from a Bogdan Stancu cross just before halftime. Three days later, on 15 October 2013, he started in the return fixture against Estonia , helping secure a 2–0 win that clinched a playoff spot for Romania , though he did not score in that match. [41] [42] [43] Keșerü's early contributions proved vital in maintaining Romania's competitiveness in the World Cup campaign, where his debut goal highlighted his aerial prowess and immediate impact as a target man. Following Pițurcă's dismissal in October 2014, new coach Anghel Iordănescu retained Keșerü for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, where he became a regular starter. Over the next two years, he featured in six Euro 2016 qualifiers, scoring once—tapping in the rebound from Alexandru Maxim's deflected free-kick in a 1–0 home victory against the Faroe Islands on 29 March 2015—and playing key roles in draws against Northern Ireland (0–0 away on 13 June 2015), Hungary (0–0 away on 4 September 2015), and Greece (0–0 home on 7 September 2015). His consistent presence helped Romania top Group F and qualify directly for the tournament. [44] [45] [43] In January 2014, Keșerü transferred from SC Bastia to FCSB midway through the 2013–14 season. He encountered initial adaptation issues upon returning to Romanian football but integrated effectively into the senior squad, using his physicality and hold-up play to complement midfield creators like Alexandru Chipciu . By the end of 2015, following a 2–2 friendly draw against Italy on 17 November , Keșerü had accumulated 10 caps and 4 international goals, with additional strikes in friendlies, including a brace against Denmark on 18 November 2014. [44] [43] UEFA Euro 2016 and aftermath Claudiu Keșerü was included in Romania's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 , announced by coach Anghel Iordănescu on 31 May 2016. [46] His strong form at Ludogorets Razgrad , where he contributed to multiple domestic titles, had elevated his international profile leading into the tournament. During the group stage in Group A, Keșerü made three appearances for Romania , starting the matches against Switzerland and Albania while coming on as a substitute against hosts France . [47] He played the full 90 minutes in the 1-1 draw with Switzerland on 15 June, where Romania equalized early through Bogdan Stancu but conceded late to Admir Mehmedi , and in the 0-1 defeat to Albania three days later, marked by a second-half own goal by Vlad Chiricheș . [48] Against France on 10 June, Keșerü entered in the 78th minute during a 0-2 loss, with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Dimitri Payet sealing Romania 's fate. These results left Romania with one point, resulting in their elimination from the tournament at the group stage. Keșerü did not score during the competition but contributed to the team's defensive resilience in the draws. Following Euro 2016, Romania entered the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers under new coach Christoph Daum , appointed in July 2016 as the nation's first foreign head coach. [49] Keșerü featured in six qualifier matches, often as a substitute with limited minutes, scoring once in a 3-1 home win against Kazakhstan on 5 October 2017. [50] The reduced playing time under Daum reflected a tactical shift that prioritized other forwards, amid Romania's struggles in Group E, where they finished fourth and failed to qualify. By the end of the qualifiers, Keșerü had contributed to Romania's international efforts. Later international appearances (2017–2021) Keșerü maintained a significant role in the Romania national team from 2017 to 2021, adding to his international tally during this phase. His contributions were particularly notable in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, where he led Romania 's scoring with 5 goals across key matches, including a brace against Norway in June 2019. These efforts helped Romania secure second place in Group F, earning qualification to the playoffs, though they ultimately fell short of the tournament proper. In subsequent competitions, Keșerü continued to deliver in the UEFA Nations League and UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers, scoring important goals such as one against Norway in October 2020 during a Nations League fixture. Over his entire international tenure, he amassed 46 caps and 13 goals for Romania . [3] His final appearance came on 11 October 2021 in a 1–0 win against Armenia in World Cup qualifying. [43] Keșerü closed out a career that positioned him as one of Romania 's leading active goalscorers at the time of his last appearance. This legacy underscored his reliability as a striker for the Tricolours, building on the foundation laid during earlier tournaments like UEFA Euro 2016. Life outside football Personal life Claudiu Keșerü was born on December 2, 1986, in Oradea , Romania . He is of partial Hungarian descent. There, he grew up and developed his early passion for football, a connection that has shaped his lifelong affinity for the city. He met his future wife, Laura Pop, during their high school years in Oradea , and after a decade-long relationship, the couple married in 2012 in a ceremony attended by family and friends. Their bond, rooted in shared hometown experiences, has remained a cornerstone of Keșerü's life amid his professional travels. The couple has two sons: Ayan, born in 2016, and Patrick, born in 2019. Keșerü has emphasized the importance of family sacrifices in his upbringing, crediting his late father—a former footballer—for instilling discipline and supporting his career from a young age, while his mother continues to be a key influence. Post-retirement, Keșerü has established a long-term base in Oradea, where he owns a leisure complex near the city that reflects his commitment to local roots; during his playing career, he resided in the Nantes area, France (2004–2010), the Razgrad/Sofia area, Bulgaria (2015–2021), Bucharest and Arad, Romania (2021–2023), and Varna, Bulgaria (2024). [6] Beyond family, Keșerü engages in philanthropy focused on supporting Romanian youth and families in need, including organizing charity football matches in 2014 to aid children in difficult situations and offering his Oradea complex for a free vacation to a low-income family of eight children in 2023. He also actively teaches football skills to his son, fostering the next generation's interest in the sport in his hometown community. Executive career Following his retirement from professional football at the end of 2024, Claudiu Keșerü returned to his hometown club FC Bihor Oradea as sporting director on January 10, 2025, signing a contract until June 2030. [51] [40] This appointment marked a significant transition for Keșerü, who began his playing career at the same club, leveraging that background to contribute to its revival in Liga II . In his role, Keșerü oversees player recruitment, youth development initiatives, and strategic planning to achieve promotion to Liga I , including analysis of the club's financial and sporting performance to optimize resources and reduce operational costs. [52] He focuses on enhancing player potential through improved medical support and internal team assessments, while appointing key staff such as Zsolt Hadnagy as scouting director to support talent identification. [52] Keșerü's early efforts included securing the signing of Dutch offensive midfielder Desley Ubbink on a half-season loan with an option to extend, aimed at bolstering the squad for the season's remainder. [52] By November 2025, his influence extended to recruiting young prospects like 17-year-old left winger Adelin Nica and integrating academy talents into the senior setup. [53] Career statistics Club Claudiu Keșerü's club career encompassed 21 seasons across Romania , France , Qatar , and Bulgaria , where he amassed 618 appearances, 277 goals, and 81 assists in all competitions combined. [54] His most prolific period came at Ludogorets Razgrad , contributing 142 goals in 247 appearances across domestic and European fixtures. [54] In domestic leagues, Keșerü recorded 494 appearances and 215 goals, with notable contributions in the Romanian Liga I (44 goals in 100 appearances post-2014, primarily during his FCSB stints) and the Bulgarian Parva Liga, where he ranks third all-time with 119 goals in 184 appearances.
