[1] The band's early work, released through Equal Vision Records , includes the debut studio album A Flair for the Dramatic (2007), which featured raw energy that garnered attention in the underground scene. This was followed by Selfish Machines (2010), which included the breakout single \"King for a Day\" featuring Kellin Quinn and propelled the band toward mainstream recognition with its theatrical lyrics and dynamic instrumentation. Signing to Fearless Records in 2012 elevated their profile, beginning with Collide with the Sky , which debuted at number one on Billboard's Top Rock Albums, Alternative Albums, and Hard Rock Albums charts and produced hits like \"A Match into Water\" and \"Bulls in the Bronx.\" [2] The 2016 release Misadventures similarly topped those same Billboard charts, showcasing matured production on tracks such as \"Circles\" and \"Floral & Fading,\" solidifying their status in the rock genre. [2] After a seven-year hiatus, The Jaws of Life (2023) returned with polished, introspective songs like \"Pass the Nirvana\" and \"Emergency Contact,\" the latter achieving the band's first number-one on the Billboard Alternative Airplay chart. A deluxe edition of the album, featuring additional tracks and collaborations, was issued in May 2025. Beyond albums, Pierce the Veil's singles discography highlights their collaborative spirit and chart success, including \"Karma Police\" (2024), a Radiohead cover that reached number 27 on the Alternative Airplay chart, and the 2025 single \"So Far So Fake,\" which topped the same chart. [3] Their music videos, often cinematic and narrative-driven, number nineteen and have amassed hundreds of millions of views, contributing to their enduring fanbase in the post-hardcore community. [1] Album releases Studio albums Pierce the Veil has released five studio albums since their formation in 2006, transitioning from post-hardcore roots to a blend of alternative rock and pop-punk influences across their catalog. Their debut album marked an independent breakthrough on a smaller label, while subsequent releases on major imprints like Equal Vision and Fearless Records achieved increasing commercial success, with later efforts peaking in the top 20 of the Billboard 200 and earning certifications for strong sales performance. Production on these albums often involved collaborations with notable producers, emphasizing the band's evolving sound through layered instrumentation and thematic depth.

It laid the foundation for their fanbase through grassroots touring, though it achieved modest chart entry limited to the Heatseekers ranking. Selfish Machines followed under producer Mike Green at The Green Room in Los Angeles , introducing more melodic elements and themes of personal turmoil; the 2013 reissue featured remixing by Dan Korneff for enhanced clarity, aligning it with the band's maturing production style. Lead single \"Bulletproof Love\" from this album helped propel its Heatseekers chart-topping debut. Collide with the Sky, also produced by Dan Korneff, represented a commercial pivot with polished hooks and guest features, debuting strongly across multiple Billboard genres and later earning RIAA Gold status for sustained sales driven by touring and radio play. Misadventures continued this trajectory under Korneff's guidance, exploring introspective lyrics amid high-energy tracks, and marked the band's highest Billboard 200 entry to date with robust first-week performance. Their latest, The Jaws of Life , co-produced by Paul Meany and Vic Fuentes, incorporated electronic textures and collaborations like Chloe Moriondo on \"Pass the Nirvana,\" achieving top spots on rock charts and international recognition in Australia; the extended and deluxe editions added bonus tracks such as the Radiohead cover \"Karma Police\" and \"Kiss Me Now,\" extending its lifecycle into 2025. [4] Video albums Pierce the Veil's only video album to date is This Is a Wasteland , a documentary film chronicling the band's first world tour in support of their 2012 studio album Collide with the Sky .

Running approximately 60 minutes, it emphasizes the visual and emotional intensity of Pierce the Veil's live shows, distinguishing it as a key document of their mid-2010s breakthrough era. The production highlights unique fan engagements, such as meet-and-greets and impromptu performances, which helped solidify the band's reputation for fostering deep connections with their audience. [6] [7] The album was distributed in DVD format, frequently bundled with a CD edition of Collide with the Sky for collectors, and also made available digitally via platforms like iTunes for broader accessibility. This multi-format approach allowed fans worldwide to experience the tour's vibrancy without attending live events, contributing to its role as a milestone in the band's visual media output.
