I’m Rebekah, a senior at Amherst College double majoring in Biochemistry and Music on the premedical track. I’m excited to serve as a Peer Career Advisor because I value the kind of reflection that helps us see how our interests and values shape our careers. Throughout college I’ve immersed myself in a wide range of pursuits—coaching beginner tennis, film scoring, composing and improvising, writing poetry, and conducting chemical engineering and biochemistry research—interests that seem to echo the breadth and curiosity of many Amherst students. Through extensive journaling and the guidance of mentors (shout out Loeb), I’ve come to see how these experiences converge on a central passion about the human story expressed through writing and the arts, while also drawing me toward quantitative challenges that sharpen my critical thinking. Currently I’m creating a music thesis in collaboration with local Cambodian genocide survivors, exploring the meanings of silence in suffering and the role of the arts in collective grief. Making college a cohesive experience—connecting classes, personal values, goals, and community—has been deeply enriching, and I hope to help others discover similar connections as they craft their own résumés and cover letters.
