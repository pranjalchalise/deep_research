Fresh off a crushing Game 7 World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the right-handed pitcher explained how he mentally reset after one of the most demanding and emotional years of his career. With Toronto once again looking to make a run at the title, Yesavage's development and George Springer's future are major storylines heading into spring training. Yesavage opens up on World Series heartbreak and heavy workload Yesavage emerged as Toronto's postseason surprise contributors in 2025, helping the club make its late playoff push and run to the Fall Classic. Across the minors, majors, and playoffs, he pitched 139.2 innings, a huge increase from the 93.1 frames he threw at East Carolina in 2024. However, according to the 23-year-old, he stepped away from the game completely. Reflecting on his loss, Yesavage said, âI spent a lot of time out in the woods hunting and just trying to be with myself and kind of disappear a little bit. â He further added, âThe ending was heartbreaking for everybody in that clubhouse because everyone worked so hard for that moment. But weâll be better for it next season.â As the 2026 season is soon to start, Yesavage has geared up for training. Talking about his 2026 plans, he said, âI had the most workload this year, and itâs the shortest off-season Iâve ever had, so I had to navigate that. Right now, Iâm really just ramping it up for spring training.â Moreover, as the season is approaching, the Blue Jays are hopeful that his reset, both mental and physical, will help him leap forward in his first full season in the majors. \"I'm just fooling around with the grip, trying to see what is the most comfortable and trying to see how I can throw my curveball the most naturally. I have a funky arm angle, so I have just got to play around with it,â he added. Yesavage has already started tweaking his arsenal as he gets ready for Opening Day. New pitches and George Springerâs uncertain future at the Blue Jays While Toronto sees Yesavage as a long-term option at the front, veteran star George Springer is facing a more uncertain future. The 36-year-old had a huge resurgence in 2025, batting at .309 with 154 hits, 32 homers, 84 RBIs, and 106 runs in 140 games, winning his third Silver Slugger Award, according to StatMuse. However, with free agency looming just around the next offseason, questions remain whether or not he will finish his career in Canada. During the Jan. 21 episode of Toronto Sports Rush, MLB.comâs reporter, Keegan Matheson, shared his take on how the Springer situation could play out. Talking about Springer, Keegan said, âHe really seemed to kind of find that joy for baseball again last year.â He further added, âI think there may be more beyond this for George, and if he can find a place where heâs DHing, plays the outfield once or twice a week, where heâs still good, heâs still solid, youâre not throwing a clunker out there to run around, I think he can keep this rolling.â As the Blue Jays embrace the 2026 season, Yesavage's revenge tour and Springer's future can be a defining season for the Toronto Blue Jays.
