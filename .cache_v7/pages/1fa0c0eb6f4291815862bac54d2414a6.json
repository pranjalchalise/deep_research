OK CASL Verify Self-Assessment: Assess your risk and compliance posture with Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation Kindle Edition by Claudiu Popa (Author) Format: Kindle Edition 1.0 1.0 out of 5 stars (1) Sorry, there was a problem loading this page.Try again. Canada's Anti-Spam Law has been called the most aggressive on the planet. CASL packs a strong punch with a combination of severe financial penalties and reputational damage. Particularly dependent on IT systems and process, the legislation makes it difficult for most small and mid-size businesses to understand, potentially introducing the real threat of legal action or public ridicule. This package includes a free professional telephone consultation (reg. $375) with certified auditors to ensure you have an opportunity to determine where you stand and whether you need to learn more about anti-spam controls. All moneys spent on this volume go directly towards the cost of a professional Verify(tm) Information Risk Assessment, conducted by experienced IT security auditors.

Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzes reviews to verify trustworthiness.
