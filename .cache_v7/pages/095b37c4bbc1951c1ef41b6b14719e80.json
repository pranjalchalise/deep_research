Disadvantages of Python Programming Language Every day you are not using Python, you are losing money. It’s true that Python is extremely popular and has a lot of fans, but it also has limitations, which developers should be aware of. Knowing the disadvantages of Python can help you choose the right instrument for the job. The following is a summary of what is considered to be the weakness of Python, and is written very simply to describe the problem. 1. Slower Execution Speed: One of the most talked-about issues with Python is the fact that it is slow when compared to compiled languages. Python is an interpreted language as well, so it executes code just one line at a time. That can make programs slower, especially for those that need to run fast. This limitation is frequently mentioned as a Python pro and con. 2. High Memory Usage Python programs tend to consume more memory than those written in other programming languages. This is because Python allocates memory dynamically and keeps some overhead information. For memory-constrained devices, this becomes a big con of Python and is a performance bottleneck in if we try to run anything close to scale, and clearly showcases the pros and cons of Python. 3. Not Ideal for Mobile App Development: Python is definitely not the best language for mobile app development. However, most mobile platforms don’t run Python itself, and developers tend to favour other languages. This limitation is among the practical drawbacks of Python for consideration in the language for mobile-targeted projects. 4. Runtime Errors: Python raises an error during the execution of the program, not prior to the execution. This can occasionally lead to unexpected crashes if exceptions are left uncaught. For massive projects, runtime errors can lengthen testing time. This is another one of the potential downsides of Python in practical development. 5. Poor Multithreading Support: Python has its own shortcomings when it comes to multithreading because of its Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This inhibits the simultaneous execution of many threads for an extended period of time. This is a disadvantage for CPU-bound work, and it is typically highlighted in the list of Python pros and cons and the list of pros and cons of Python. 6. Slow Database Access Speed: While Python interfaces well with databases, its database access layer is slow compared to some other languages. This could impact applications that require rapid database transactions, again adding to the list of Python's cons. 7. Relying on external libraries: For many tasks, Python is quite dependent on third-party libraries. An obsolete or unsupported library can cause problems. Dependency management is notoriously difficult in large projects, also a key point in the pros and cons of Python discussion.
