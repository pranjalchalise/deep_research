What people are saying Testimonials Cred că ce m-a surprins cel mai mult a fost nivelul discuțiilor – atât de vii, atât de sincere. Speakerii au știut să creeze un spațiu liber, în care fiecare întrebare conta. A fost o conferință care m-a făcut să-mi pun întrebări despre cum ar trebui să arate, cu adevărat, învățarea în fotbal. Alex Chipiciu Professional footballer , Universitatea Cluj What I felt there was a genuine sense of belonging. I had never been in a space where coaches could speak openly, listen to one another, and learn together like that. It was more than a conference – it was a real community in the making.

Ștefan Toma Youth Coach , C.S Dinamo Academy Radical Football Conference was a breath of fresh air.
