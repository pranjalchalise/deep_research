Alex Lee grew out of Merchants Produce Company, which was founded in 1931 by Alex and Lee George. Alex and Lee were generous people who cared about both friends and strangers. Alex George, the entrepreneur, knew everyone's name and directed the warehouse operations. Lee George, the negotiator, was adept at procurement and sales, but was best known for his kindness. Their integrity, honesty, fairness, and loyalty earned them wide trust and great respect among both customers and employees. Alex and Lee believed in customer service and guided the company through good and bad times by focusing on how they could best serve the customer. The tradition started by the two brothers continues today at the Alex Lee family of companies. Each of the Alex Lee companies has grown tremendously over the years by remaining committed to doing what's right for the customer. Lowes Foods Lowes Foods is a grocery retailer with stores located throughout the Carolinas and Georgia. Founded as a single store in 1954 in North Wilkesboro, N.C., Lowes Foods now has over 80 locations. Despite our growth, we weave “local” into everything we do.
