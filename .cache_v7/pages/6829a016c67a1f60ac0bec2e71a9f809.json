Lee, the founding father of modern Singapore and its prime minister from 1959 to 1990, has honed his wisdom during more than fifty years on the world stage. Almost single-handedly responsible for transforming Singapore into a Western-style economic success, he offers a unique perspective on the geopolitics of East and West. American presidents from Richard Nixon to Barack Obama have welcomed him to the White House; British prime ministers from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair have recognized his wisdom; and business leaders from Rupert Murdoch to Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil, have praised his accomplishments. This book gathers key insights from interviews, speeches, and Lee’s voluminous published writings and presents them in an engaging question and answer format. Lee offers his assessment of China’s future, asserting, among other things, that “China will want to share this century as co-equals with the U.S.” He affirms the United States’ position as the world’s sole superpower but expresses dismay at the vagaries of its political system. He offers strategic advice for dealing with China and goes on to discuss India’s future, Islamic terrorism, economic growth, geopolitics and globalization, and democracy. Lee does not pull his punches, offering his unvarnished opinions on multiculturalism, the welfare state, education, and the free market. This little book belongs on the reading list of every world leader.

Editorial Reviews Review “This short book [is] packed with intelligence and insight. If you are interested in the future of Asia, which means the future of the world, you’ve got to read this book.” —Fareed Zakaria, CNN, “Book of the Week” “Lee’s powerful intellect is captured in a new book, Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World . It’s a collection of interviews with him by Harvard University professor Graham Allison, Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Robert Blackwill and Harvard's Belfer Center researcher Ali Wyne, while also drawing on other selected and cited writings by and about Lee. Now 89, officially retired and somewhat frail, Lee has mellowed with age—not unlike his creation Singapore, governed today with a lighter touch even as its citizens grow more vocal. Yet, as the book, and the adaptation here of the China chapter, reveal, Lee is as sharp, direct and prescient as ever. Though the volume was completed before China’s current territorial tensions with its neighbors, it helps expose, and explain, Beijing’s hardball mind-set.” — TIME Magazine “Graham Allison and Bob Blackwill have important questions to ask about China, America and the extraordinary impact of the relationship of those two countries on the rest of the world. For answers, they turned to Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first premier and one of the world’s most formidable geopolitical thinkers and strategists. The result is a fascinating book called Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China , the United States, and the World.” —Ian Bremmer, Reuters “ Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World forms a kind of last testament of the ailing, 89-year-old Mr. Lee. It is based on interviews with Mr. Lee by the authors—Graham Allison, a professor of government at Harvard’s Kennedy School, and Robert Blackwill, a former U.S. diplomat—to which the authors add a distillation of Mr. Lee’s speeches, writings and interviews with others over many years.” —Karen Elliott House, Wall Street Journal “ Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World is an anthology of interviews and speeches Lee has given over the last four decades . . . readers will find themselves entertained and challenged by Lee Kuan Yew’s lucidity, powerful arguments and acerbic tongue.” —Anchalee Kongrut, Economic Observer “Lee is a force of nature. Up close and personal, he can blow you away with one overpowering dismissive glare. Has there ever been anyone like him? . . . [The book] will reinforce the consensus view that Asia bred something special in Lee.” —Tom Plate, South China Morning Post “Lee excels in pithy evaluations of regional and national strengths and weaknesses. At his best, the man is a cross between Confucius and Machiavelli.” —Aram Bakshian Jr, Washington Times “The authors, a team of eminent strategy thinkers, took the opportunity of recording [Lee Kuan Yew’s] views on the world, and the way it’s likely to take shape over the next quarter century. The result is this concise, but important book, that looks at the futures of China, the US and India, as well as important contemporary issues, from globalisation and democracy to Islamic extremism—all delivered in Lee’s characteristically incisive, and occasionally politically incorrect manner.” —Anvar Alikhan, Outlook “I found myself engrossed this week by the calm, incisive wisdom of one of the few living statesmen in the world who can actually be called visionary. The wisdom is in a book, Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States and the World , a gathering of Mr. Lee’s interviews, speeches and writings . . . He is now 89, a great friend of America, and his comments on the U.S. are pertinent to many of the debates in which we’re enmeshed.” —Peggy Noonan, Wall Street Journal “The contribution of Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World to the debate about Asia’s future is unique . . . [It] sets down the thoughts of an 89-year-old veteran of 20th century history with much to say about the future. The book is densely packed with Lee’s characteristically blunt assessments of issues, countries and people. The text has been deftly assembled and extensively footnoted.” —Stephen Minas, LSE Review of Books “[A]fter reading a good 20 pages, readers will be mesmerised by Lee’s lucidity and entertained by his acerbic tongue. After all, he is a good critic because he is not wholly shaped by ideology, nor does he try to be politically correct . . . The final chapter, ‘How Lee Kuan Yew Thinks’, reveals the human side of this formidable man and is a must-read . . . this book is a good read not only for students of politics, but also for readers interested in strategic thinking. Right-wing activists and liberal thinkers alike should read this book because gifted authoritarian figures such as Lee are increasingly rare.” — Bangkok Post “A perceptive and concise read, detailing the wisdom of a man who has been at the political forefront for close to 50 years . . . the book’s question-and-answer format [is] an ideal one—[Lee’s] responses were mostly short, sweet and most importantly, smart . . . [This book will] educate and enlighten by condensing the man’s vast intellect into accessible nuggets of information. [It] shows, again, why he is still one of the world’s most lucid thinkers.” — Prestige Magazine “The new book of interviews with Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister of Singapore, by Graham Allison, Robert Blackwill, and Ali Wyne is fantastic.” —Noah Feldman, Boston Globe “[ Lee Kuan Yew ] may be the single best available volume for those who want a quick grasp of Lee’s thinking on foreign affairs and geopolitics . . . in compiling such a rich collection of statements on such a wide range of global issues, Allison and Blackwill have done both scholars and general readers a service by providing a manageable, one-stop shop on Lee’s thinking.” —David Plott, Global Asia “Relations between Asian powers and the United States are constantly shifting, so insights into how to navigate the resulting diplomatic challenges are at a premium. Singapore’s longtime prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, is uniquely placed to offer such insights. In this book, he bluntly describes how he sees major players like China and the United States interacting in the coming years and sheds light on the intentions of each, with the purpose of informing experts and leadership in both capitals.” — Foreign Service Journal About the Author Graham Allison is Douglas Dillon Professor of Government and Director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School. Robert D. Blackwill is Henry A. Kissinger Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Ali Wyne is an associate of the Belfer Center.

Full content visible, double tap to read brief content. Lee Kuan Yew, GCMG, CH, SPMJ (born Harry Lee Kuan Yew, 16 September 1923 – 23 March 2015), informally known by his initials LKY, was the first Prime Minister of Singapore, governing for more than three decades from 1959 to 1990, including through Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965. After Lee chose to step down as Prime Minister in 1990, Lee's successor, Goh Chok Tong, appointed him as Senior Minister, a post he held until 2004, when his elder son, Lee Hsien Loong, became the nation's third prime minister. The elder Lee then assumed the advisory post of Minister Mentor until he left the Cabinet in 2011. In total, Lee held successive ministerial positions for 56 years. He continued to serve his Tanjong Pagar constituency for nearly 60 years as an elected Member of Parliament until his death in 2015. Lee is recognised as the founding father of independent Singapore, with the country being described as transitioning from the \"third world to the first world in a single generation\" under his leadership. Lee graduated from Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University, with a double starred-first-class honours in law. In 1950, he became a barrister of the Middle Temple and practised law until 1959. Lee co-founded the People's Action Party (PAP) in 1954 and was its first secretary-general, a position he held until 1992, leading the party to eight consecutive victories. He campaigned for Britain to relinquish its colonial rule. His view was shared by the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan (1957–1963), who was keen on a merger of British colonial territories across South East Asia, including Singapore, in order to hasten the end of British rule, whilst sharing similar concerns to those of Lee about avoiding possible Communist infiltration in Singapore. Britain withdrew in 1963, when Singapore merged with Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak to form the new federation of Malaysia. Racial strife and political tensions led to Singapore's separation from the Malaysian Federation two years later. With overwhelming parliamentary control, Lee and his cabinet oversaw Singapore's transformation from a relatively underdeveloped colonial outpost with no natural resources to an Asian Tiger economy. In the process, he forged an effective system of meritocratic and highly efficient government and civil service. Many of his policies are now taught at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Lee eschewed populist policies in favor of pragmatic long-term social and economic measures. With meritocracy and multiracialism as the governing principles, Lee made English the common language to integrate its immigrant society and to facilitate trade with the West. However, Lee also mandated bilingualism in schools for students to preserve their mother-tongue cultural identity. Lee's rule was criticised, particularly in the West, for curtailing civil liberties (public protests, media control) and bringing libel suits against political opponents. He argued that such disciplinary measures were necessary for political stability, which together with rule of law, were essential for economic progress. Bio from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Please reload the page. Frank G. Splitt 5.0 out of 5 stars Penetrating Insights from an Authentic Leader Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2013 Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase The book is a true gem, a must read for those interested, or, ought to be interested in world politics, economics, competition, and relationships.[1] The Foreword is by Henry Kissinger who says: \"I have had the privilege of meeting many world leaders over the past half century; none, however, has taught me more than Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first premier and it's guiding spirit ever since.\" He goes on to describe Lee as \"a man of unmatched intelligence and judgment.\" Graham Allison, a professor of government at Harvard's Kennedy School, and Robert Blackwill, a former U.S. diplomat, follow Kissinger's remarks with a chapter covering laudatory comments about Lee from presidents (U.S. and other), Chinese Leaders, and many others. Over many years, these world leaders, corporate CEOs, scholars and journalists have made the pilgrimage to Singapore to seek his views. The author's go on to do an exhaustive job of plumbing the depths of a truly wise man with meticulous referencing of the voluminous quotes that form the core of this 158-page book. The source references for these quotes cover 28-pages that stem from interviews with Lee as well as from his speeches, writings and interviews with others over the years. The book focuses on the future and the specific challenges that the U.S. will face during the next quarter century. Readers that are fairly well acquainted with U.S. socio-economic politics should not be surprised to find that Lee believes that although the U.S. is not yet a \"second rate power,\"...the inability of its political leaders to make unpopular decisions does not bode well for its future. \"...the American voter has shown a disinclination to listen to their political leaders when they debate the hard issues ...neither the Republican nor the Democratic Party has focused on the urgent need to cut down deficit spending, especially on welfare, to increase savings and investments, or, most crucial of all, to improve America's school system to produce workers who are able to compete internationally,\" says Lee. Lee sees the breakdown of civil society when individual rights are not paired with individual responsibility leading to a growing culture of entitlements. He thinks that once charity became an entitlement in the U.S., the stigma of living on charity disappeared. As a result, entitlement costs outpace government resources, resulting in huge debts for future generations. In the meantime, America's political leaders kick the can down the road to win elections. This observation brings to mind a quote .usually attributed to the 18th-century Scottish historian Alexander Tytler; to wit: \"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy.\" Notwithstanding the above, Lee still remains somewhat optimistic about the future of the U.S. and its role in the world. In his view, America's \"creativity, resilience, and innovative spirit will allow it to confront its core problems, overcome them and regain its competitiveness.\" Americans believe that they can \"make things happen,\" and thus they usually do. As for the BRIC nations - Brazil, Russia, India and China - Lee believes that these countries will not gain influence as a bloc over time but can prevent excesses by Americans and Europeans with China already dominating Asia and intending to become the world's leading power. Russia has been unable to develop an economy that generates wealth independent of exports of energy and natural resources. India, for the most part is a tired bureaucracy hampered by its caste system. Lee believes China is determined to be \"the greatest power in the world,\" and it expects to be accepted on its own terms, \"not as an honorary member of the West.\" He also believes that China plans to become competitive by focusing on educating its young people, selecting the brightest for science and technology, followed by economics, business management, and English language. Lee's views on the high value the Chinese place on education have been and still are corroborated on a consistent basis. For example, see the April 4, 2013, issue of the Wall Street Journal for stories titled \"Chinese Deluge U.S. Master's Programs\" and \"Hong Kong School Joined the Elite Fast.\"[2, 3] Yet despite China's progress over the past 30 years, Lee sees it burdened with multiple handicaps, chief among these is an absence of the rule of law, the presence of widespread corruption, and the Chinese language itself--which \"is exceedingly difficult for foreigners to learn sufficiently to embrace China and be embraced by its society,\" and a culture that does not \"permit a free exchange and contest of ideas.\" He says the biggest fear of China's leaders is popular revulsion at the corrosive effects of graft. Lee argues that while competition between the United States and China is inevitable, confrontation need not be since the Chinese have concluded that their best strategy is to build a strong and prosperous future, and use their skilled and educated workers to out-sell and out-build all others. The U.S. shouldn't expect a democratic China: \"China is not going to become a liberal democracy; if it did, it would collapse.\" In China's 5,000 years of recorded history, he notes, the emperor has ruled by right, and if the people disagree, \"you chop off heads, not count heads.\" As for Islamist extremism, Lee believes that if Iran gets the bomb, a nuclear war in the Middle East is almost inevitable, but blames Saudi Arabia for encouraging the growth of Islamist extremism by financing mosques, religious schools and preachers world-wide to spread its \"austere version of Wahhabist Islam.\" Lee considers North Korea to be a perennial problem, saying: \"A young man, Kim Jong-un, has taken over and is trying to show the world that he is bold and adventurous as his predecessors.\" These are just a few of Lee's many penetrating insights based on his experiences in life and politics Lee's three political heroes - Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill and Deng Xiaoping -- do not include an American. His admiration is based on the fact that each held a weak hand at a critical moment in history and, through guts and determination, managed to win. Lee is a firm believer that leaders are born not made, and that leaders should be judged by their accomplishments, saying \"The acid test is in performance, not promises.\" As with his three heroes, Lee began with a weak hand in Singapore but, by playing it to maximum effect, made himself a wise man and unquestionably one of the most fascinating and respected leaders in the world. __________ Endnotes: 1. I have had a special interest in the rise of Singapore and Lee Kuan Yew ever since a friend, Dr. William Schowalter, became the Senior Advisor to the National University of Singapore (NUS). Bill is a former Dean of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He served as the chair of the 2012 Global Asia Institute Signature Conference at NUS University Town that aimed to transcend the boundaries of geography and knowledge to resolve issues critical to the future of Asia. 2. In China, which educates approximately one-half of the world's engineers, engineering education is valued as a preparation for contributions in government, policy, innovation, intellectual property, broad engineering disciplines, and manufacturing. The study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEMs) is considered to be a patriotic duty -- providing a robust pipeline of human resources for R&D. 3. This is in sharp contrast to the U.S., where, for all intents and purposes, government at all levels stands idle while many of its most prestigious schools prostitute themselves in a mostly futile quest for fame and fortune via their sports entertainment businesses. In December 2009,Darren Everson, Hannah Karp, and Mark Yost each published a college sports story in The Wall Street Journal that taken together offer chilling evidence that America's colleges and universities are helping to lead the way as it slithers toward second-rate nationhood.

This book really covers briefly the ongoing topic of the US-China Relations, and how the US has to acknowledge the fact that China will be equal to USA or even bigger which the USA should look to discuss the world's problems with China and also touches on topics such as the US-India Relations as a \"strategic partnership to encircle China\". Aswell as other topics such as Islamic Extremism and Economic growth, Globalisation, Democracy and How Me Lee thinks. The Author also describes excellently how Mr Lee was the \"founding father\" and how he transformed Singapore from a third world country into one of the superior world countries. This book also provides how well respected Mr Lee was well respected by all the world leaders including George H.W. Bush, Jacques Chirac, Tony Blair, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Etc... Mr Lee also provides short and effective answers to many questions for example he mentions that Third World countries need powerful leaders like him self and how leader should ignore criticism and advice from experts. Aswell as the risks of Democracy aswell as discussing his problems with the Politcal system in America and multiculturalism. Overall this is a really inspirational book of a character that will go down in history, and a book I definitely advice you all to read.

W. Bush, Jacques Chirac, Tony Blair, John Major, Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Schmidt,Hillary Clinton, Madeleine Albright, and Henry Kissinger. Lew Kuan Yew is an extraordinary individual. As \"Father of Singapore,\" he transformed some resource-poor islands into a country with a per capita GDP rivaling that of the United States. He has become a global 'wise man' to leaders from China and elsewhere, who respectfully seek his counsel. His pragmatism, which led him to be a highly successful 'benevolent dictator,' is reflected in his no-nonsense assessment of the world. This book collects, from articles and interviews, much of Lee's outspoken wisdom. He eschews theory, and especially academics, for pragmatism, clear focus, and attention to middle-and-long-term results. He agrees with Machiavelli that \"human beings, regrettable though it may be, are inherently vicious and have to be restrained from their viciousness.\" He also supports Machiavelli's view that it is better to be feared than loved. For Lee, the key for the successful transformation of any society is 1) a determined leadership; 2) an administration which is efficient; and 3) social discipline. This book draws on many of Lee's views over recent decades. The authors have organized these in ten chapters that, at times, overlap. An index would have been helpful. I set forth below some highlights from these chapters. A reader would greatly benefit from the narrative, in this relatively short book, from which these insights are drawn. THE FUTURE OF CHINA + \"It is China's intention to be the greatest power in the world;\" + \"The Chinese have concluded that they need 30 to 40, maybe 50,years of peace to catch up, build up their system, change from the communist system to the market system;\" + \"In the geopolitical sense, they are more concerned now with using diplomacy in their foreign policy, not force;\" + \"The biggest fear Chinese leaders have is the corrosive effect of graft and the revulsion that it evokes in people: They are never quite sure when it will blow up;\" + \"China faces enormous economic problems;\" + \"China has more handicaps going forward and more obstacles to overcome than most observers recognize;\" + \"China is not going to become a liberal democracy; if it did, it would collapse;\" + \"The Chinese fear chaos and will always err on the side of caution.\" THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES + \"For the next two or three decades America will remain the sole super power;\" + \"What has made the U. S. economy is its entrepreneurial culture....The U. S. is a frontier society;\" + \"There is a tendency to procrastinate, to postpone unpopular policies in order to win elections....Neither the Republican nor the Democratic Party has focused on the urgent need to cut down deficit spending, especially on welfare, to increase savings and investments, or, most crucial of all, to improve America's school system to produce workers who are able to complete internationally;\" + \"I believe that what a country needs to develop is discipline more than democracy;\" + \"Multiculturalism will destroy America.\" THE FUTURE OF U.S.-CHINESE RELATIONS + \"China is acting purely as China in its own national interests. It is not interested in changing the world;\" + \"Sino-U. S. relations are both cooperative and competitive. Competition between them is inevitable, but conflict is not;\" + \"A stabilizing factor in their relationship...is that each nation requires cooperation and healthy competition with the other. The danger of military conflict between China and the U. S. is low;\" + \"The size of China makes it impossible for the rest of Asia, including Japan and India, to match it in weight and capacity in about 20 or 30 years. So we need America to strike a balance;\" + \"America believes their ideas are universal-the supremacy of the individual and free, unfettered expression. But they are not-never were;\" + \"Do not treat China as an enemy from the outset. Otherwise, it will develop a strategy to demolish the U. S. in the Asia-Pacific;\" + \"If the U. S. attempts to humiliate China, keep it down, it will assure itself as enemy;\" + \"America's greatest long-term influence in China comes from playing host to the thousands of students who come from China every year.\" THE FUTURE OF INDIA + \"India has wasted decades in state planning and controls that have bogged it down in bureaucracy and corruption;\" + \"There are limitations in the Indian constitutional system and the Indian political system that prevents it from going at a high speed;\" + \"India's private sector is superior to China's....India has a stronger banking system....India has stronger institutions-in particular, a well-developed legal system;\" + \"Corruption bedevils both, but bureaucratic red tape has lowered India's efficiency and effectiveness more than China's;\" + \"\"In the last 20 years there has been a proliferation of schemes for cheap food, free power, and subsidized loans....The distinction between welfare and populism has blurred;\" + \"Democracy should not be an alibi for inertia....The real issue is whether any country's political system, irrespective of whether it is democratic or authoritarian, can forge a consensus on the policies needed for the economy to grow and create jobs for all.\" THE FUTURE OF ISLAMIC EXPANSION + \"This surge in Islamic terrorism will take years to tamp down. In the meantime the world is at risk of these terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction....The nuclear weapons of rogue states, therefore, must be stopped and their stock piles of weapons and materials confiscated;\" + \"The Israeli-Palestine conflict is not the cause of Islamic terrorism. Among Muslims, especially in the Middle East, there is a profound belief that their time has come and that the West has put them down for too long;\" + \"Even if there is an Israeli-Palestine settlement, the U. S. and its Western allies must ensure that Islamic militancy is defeated by economic, military, and other means to clearly demonstrate to non-Arab Muslims that fanaticism and militancy have no future;\" + \"In Southeast Asia, the Muslims are different. They are relaxed, and easy to get on with;\" + \"Islamists believe that the time is ripe to reassert Islamic supremacy;\" + \"I can see the [Islamic extremists] inducing fear and insecurity, and causing fear, but they do not have the technology and organization to overwhelm any government;\" + \"It may take another 20, 30 years, but the theocratic state will fail;\" + \"In Muslim countries, it is a matter of time before the moderate Muslims have to put down the extremists, or they will end up with Taliban government in charge of them, as in Afghanistan;\" + \"Whether Islamic extremism is a bigger or smaller problem 10, 15, or 25 years from now depends on what happens in the oil states, particularly Saudi Arabia;\" + \"A worldwide coalition is necessary to fight the fires of hatred that the Islamic fanatics are fanning. When moderate Muslim countries, such as those in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Persian Gulf states, Egypt, and Jordan, feel comfortable associating themselves openly with a multilateral coalition against Islamic terrorism, the tide of battle will turn against the extremists.\" THE FUTURE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH + \"There is no reason why third world leaders cannot succeed in achieving growth and development if they maintain social order, educate their people, maintain peace with their neighbors, and gain the confidence of investors by upholding the rule of law;\" + \"Demography, not democracy, will be the most critical factor for security and growth in the 21st century;\" + \"The quality of a nation's manpower resources is the single most important factor determining national competitiveness;\" + \"Unlike work in the repetitive machine-based age, tomorrow's workers must depend more on their own knowledge and skills....They must be disciplined enough to think on their own and to seek to excel without someone breathing down their neck.\" THE FUTURE OF GEOPOLITICS AND GLOBALIZATION + \"Iran's nuclear program is the challenge that the world is most likely to bungle;\" + \" [Russia's] system is not functioning...because it has gone haywire. They have lost control over various provinces....They have an enormous nuclear arsenal, but what else? Their army is a very different army now....Their population is declining;\" + \"The global crisis was caused by excesses n the liberal system of regulations and the belief that a completely free market will allow enormous innovation and allocate capital to the most profitable enterprises with the highest returns;\" + \"\"Prior to the current economic crisis the world did not challenge the Washington consensus that the Anglo-Saxon economic model is the most efficient for the allocation of financial resources to produce the highest return. However, the U. S. model is no longer considered ideal. China is confident that it is better for the government to maintain control of and manage its economy;\" + \"The ultimate threat to human survival is global warming and climate change;\" + \"People must stay abreast of the state-of-the-art technology, but must never lose their core values;\" + \"In one interdependent, interrelated world the decline in the relative dominance of the leaders of the two blocs increases the likelihood of a multi-polar world, and with it the difficulties of multilateral cooperation;\" + \"The great challenge today is to adjust to the tectonic shift in the global economic balance;\" + \"The gravest challenge will be to protect the values we cherish....If you want to thrive in the modern world, then you must not be afraid.\" THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY + \"Only an efficient and effective government can provide the framework in which people can fulfill their needs;\" + \"The business of a government is to...make firm decisions so that there can be certainty and stability in the affairs of the people;\" + \"Westerners have abandoned an ethical basis for society, believing that all problems are soluble by a good government;\" + \"A nation is not great by size alone. It is the will, the cohesion, the stamina, the discipline of its people, and the quality of their leaders which ensure it an honorable place in history;\" + \"Government, to be effective, must at least give the impression of enduring, and a government which is open to the vagaries of the ballot box-when the people who put their crosses in the ballot boxes are not illiterate but semi-literate, which is worse-is a government which is already weakened before it starts to govern;\" + \"One person, one vote is a most difficult form of government. From time to time, the results can be erratic. People are sometimes fickle. They get bored with stable, steady improvements in life, and, in a reckless moment, they vote for change for change's sake;\" + \"I understand Deng Xiaoping when he said if 200,000 students have to be killed, shoot them, because the alternative in China is chaos for another 100 years....Deng understood, and he released it stage by stage. Without Deng, China would have imploded;\" + \"When a state of increasing disorder and defiance of authority cannot be checked by the rules then existing...drastic rules have to be forged to maintain order so that law can continue to govern human relations. The alternative is to surrender order for chaos and anarchy;\" + \"Communism has failed. The welfare state of Western democracies has also failed;\" + \"No society has ever existed in history where all people were equal and obtained equal rewards....It is possible to create a society in which everybody is given not equal rewards, but equal opportunities;\" + \"To create wealth, high motivation and incentive are critical to drive a person to achieve, to take risks for profit, or there will be nothing to share;\" + \"You can teach a person to be a manager, but not a leader. They must have the extra drive, intellectual verve, an extra tenacity, and the will to overcome.\" Read more 26 people found this helpful Helpful Report See more reviews Top reviews from other countries B.

Mr. Yew is highly intelligent and had a long list of political achievements.The label Grand Master may even be an understatement. The Grand Master`s career exposed him to a Western and Asia perspective on life. This is what makes the book so unique. Very few people have a social and political understanding of the Asian and Western World. Western readers will find the information on China`s long-term political strategy, of the utmost interest. Yew is also not afraid to make bold politically incorrect statements. In other words, Yew has enough strength of character, to be honest. It is somewhat painful, to compare other modern leaders to Yew. The reader will be impressed, by Mr. Kew`s insights and observations. The 21st Century has just started. This book will help the reader understand, how this new century is unfolding. This short book is highly recommended.

There is also an interesting chapter called \"How Lee Kuan Yew Thinks\" that takes a \"meta\" view of the ideologies, filters, heuristics, and experiences that have shaped LKY's views on the foregoing topics. The main reasons why this book is worth the time of anyone interested in Asia-Pacific are the astonishing breadth of LKY's worldview and the (mostly) high quality of his analysis of the issues presented, both of which are made highly accessible by LKY's clear, thoughtful and logical style of speaking. That said, LKY is decidedly weaker in some areas than others, his views on democracy and multiculturalism being prominent among these. Whenever he reflects on Asian geopolitics and economics, he shines. Even though he was the leader of a small and relatively less powerful (though increasingly economically influential) city-state in Asia, LKY's worldview encompassed not only the entire Asia-Pacific region, but also much of the world beyond. The depth of his knowledge of the histories, cultures and politics of China, India, Europe and the US, and to an extent Russia and the Arab world, is truly impressive. Through the course of the book, LKY demonstrates both how his understanding of the world helped him to predict future geopolitical trends, and how he was able to cherry-pick the best practices of wealthier countries that he then adapted and implemented in Singapore. There could not be a more compelling argument than this book for why it is so vital for leaders, whether of nations, business, or other global institutions, to be fully educated about the world around them. The book also reveals how LKY's worldview was accompanied by a razor-sharp analytical ability. LKY was able to put a country's culture, history, and politics in context to explain why its leaders or people act the way they do, and how they are likely to act in the future. The best examples of this ability are to be found in LKY's accounts of the rise of China and the underlying causes of global Islamic extremism (which, he points out, would have continued to grow regardless of 9/11). Other striking attributes of LKY that this book makes readily apparent are his pragmatism and clarity of communication. LKY appears to have been the opposite of an ideologue - he identified the end goal of increasing the economic prosperity of the majority of people in the country he led, and then chased down that goal with a relentless pragmatism. He advocates the simple mantra of \"if it produces results, it's worth doing\". He is also an exceptionally clear speaker - he presents his ideas in the most direct and concise way possible, completely free of political platitudes, demagoguery or jargon. As an Indian reader, this is a very refreshing change from what I've come to expect from politicians! An important caveat is that readers should always be aware of the timespan covered by this book - the interviews of LKY range from 1950 to 2011, and are presented by issue rather than chronologically. This can throw readers off when LKY is discussing developments in the 2000s in one paragraph, but the next is taken from the 1960s. The footnotes come in very useful here - use them! All told, if you are interested in the future of Asian geopolitics, you can't go wrong with this book. It won't take much time to read it, and LKY's insights will likely stay with you long after you do.
