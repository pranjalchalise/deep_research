Treating osteoporosis optimally is paramount. Osteoporosis management is evolving rapidly beyond traditional therapies. This 2025 review examines available traditional therapies and novel pharmacological approaches developed. Key questions addressed include the mechanisms, efficacy, and safety of agents like the sclerostin inhibitor romosozumab, Parathyroid hormone targeted agents, cytokine inhibitors and the status of therapies targeting cathepsin K. We evaluate the growing importance of combined and sequential treatment strategies, particularly initiating potent anabolic or dual-action therapies followed by antiresorptives for high-risk patients. Furthermore, the review explores emerging therapeutic targets such as modulators of the Wnt pathway, inflammation, and bone cell metabolism, alongside advancements in drug delivery, gene therapy, and non-pharmacological interventions. Clinical implications for patient selection, monitoring, and navigating the expanding treatment landscape are discussed, highlighting future directions towards personalized osteoporosis care. Introduction Osteoporosis, a common systemic metabolic disease [1], is characterized by a decrease in bone density and bone mass, destruction of bone tissue microstructure, and increased bone fragility leading to fracture susceptibility [1]. Osteoporosis is sometimes referred to as a silent disease because bone loss occurs without signs or symptoms until fractures occur [2]. Estimated prevalence is over 200 million individuals globally [3], The worldwide prevalence is estimated at 18.3 %, higher in women (23.1 %) than men (11.7 %) [4], with 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over 50 suffering osteoporotic fractures [3]. In Australia, the economic impact is substantial, with projected annual costs exceeding $3.82 billion, where fracture-related expenses account for 67 % of total costs [5]. The global burden and costs associated with osteoporotic fractures are significant [6]. The disease results from an imbalance in bone turnover, where bone resorption exceeds formation. Multiple factors [7] contribute to this imbalance, including age-related changes, hormonal deficiencies (particularly post-menopausal estrogen deficiency), genetic factors, nutritional status, lifestyle factors like smoking, and low physical activity. Secondary causes such as medications (e.g., glucocorticoids, proton pump inhibitors, antiepileptics) and medical conditions (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, thyroid disorders, chronic kidney disease) significantly influence disease development and progression. Traditional treatment strategies primarily utilized antiresorptive agents and anabolic agents [8], with bisphosphonates being the most commonly prescribed antiresorptive [9]. While these medications effectively reduce fracture risk, their limitations include potential adverse effects with prolonged use [10] and reduced efficacy in severe osteoporosis. Conventional treatments include Selective Estrogen-Receptor Modulators (SERMs), bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone analogs, and calcitonin [1]. The development of anabolic agents that promote bone formation has provided alternative options for high-risk patients [11]. Diagnosis commonly involves bone mineral density measurement using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to generate a T-score, with osteoporosis defined by a T-score of −2.5 or lower according to WHO criteria [12]. Fracture risk assessment tools like FRAX incorporate clinical risk factors alongside BMD [13]. This review examines emerging therapeutic approaches in osteoporosis management, including recently approved medications, novel treatment modalities, and investigational therapeutic targets [14]. We assess the mechanisms of action, clinical trial outcomes, safety profiles, and practical implementation considerations. Additionally, we evaluate combination and sequential therapy strategies that may enhance patient outcomes. Section snippets Understanding bone remodeling and pathophysiology of osteoporosis Understanding remodeling provides useful insights into the cause and therapeutic targets for osteoporosis management [15]. Antiresorptive therapies Bisphosphonates (BP) remain the most widely prescribed medications for osteoporosis, often considered first-line therapy [26]. They bind to hydroxyapatite in bone and inhibit osteoclast function through multiple mechanisms, including disruption of the mevalonate pathway in nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (Table 1). Commonly used bisphosphonates include alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid. These agents reduce vertebral, non-vertebral fracture and hip fracture risk ( Sclerostin, Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and Wnt pathways The importance of sclerostin as a therapeutic target was initially recognized through genetic studies of rare high bone mass disorders, such as sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease, which are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the SOST gene [67]. Affected individuals exhibit increased bone formation and exceptionally high bone mass, highlighting the potential of sclerostin inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Romosozumab is the first to be in clinical use. Other agents are in trial Patient selection for novel therapies Rheumatologists manage a high-risk cohort of patients with traditional risk factors compounded by inflammatory disease and treatments and physical limitations that accelerate osteoporosis and fracture risk. The expanding array of therapeutic options for osteoporosis necessitates careful consideration of patient characteristics, fracture risk, and treatment history when selecting the most appropriate therapy (Table 2,Table 4). Addressing the treatment gap Despite the availability of effective therapies, osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, with estimates suggesting that fewer than 25 % of patients who experience an osteoporotic fracture receive appropriate treatment. This treatment gap is particularly pronounced in men, younger postmenopausal women, and those with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Fracture Liaison Services (FLS) [92]; which Rheumatologists should actively participate in as core business have demonstrated Conclusion The landscape of osteoporosis treatment has evolved significantly in recent years, with novel therapies offering new mechanisms of action, enhanced efficacy, and potential for personalized treatment approaches. Anabolic agents such as teriparatide and abaloparatide, dual-action therapies like romosozumab, and improved sequential and combination strategies have expanded options for patients at high fracture risk. Emerging targets and technologies, from Wnt pathway modulators beyond sclerostin to Practice points • Risk stratification is important, for very high-risk patients, initiate therapy with an anabolic agent followed immediately by an antiresorptive (bisphosphonate or denosumab) to maximize BMD gains and maintain them. • Monitor drug-specific safety: Assess cardiovascular risk/history before romosozumab; monitor calcium with teriparatide, abaloparatide, and denosumab (especially in renal impairment); monitor for MRONJ in dental procedures and AFF with longer term treatment with bisphosphonates. • Research agenda • Establish long-term safety and durable efficacy for novel therapies (e.g., extended romosozumab data). • Conduct comparative effectiveness trials of novel agents and optimal sequential therapy strategies. • Investigate mechanisms underlying cardiovascular safety signals (sclerostin/cathepsin K inhibitors). • Develop and validate personalized medicine markers (genetic, imaging, biomarker) for risk/response prediction. • Define optimal strategies for therapy transitions, especially mitigating denosumab CRediT authorship contribution statement Charles Inderjeeth: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Methodology, Investigation.
