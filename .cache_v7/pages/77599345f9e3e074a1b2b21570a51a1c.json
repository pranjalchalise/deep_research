I help top performers find their authentic selves in order to come from a confident decision-making place. As a fellow seeker I have found that liberating the soul enables anyone to transition from anxiety to acceptance. It is my hope to help you find the truest expression of your soul, while taming the ego without having to dampen your spirit. Latest Episode Follow Episodes 12/05/2024 174. Planting Seeds for 2025 (You're Invited!) What a fun thing, this life, right? We feel ungrounded, we get balanced, we try to regulate the energy, a holiday comes and knocks off the routine and we try to keep it going without falter. Well, speak for myself anyway. I missed ya'll the last couple weeks but that doesn't mean I wasn't thinking about you. Let's get you signed up for the upcoming January 2025 workshop to Define Success for yourself, and not what it looks like for everyone else. Send me a DM on the socials or send an email to info@quantumhighways.com. https://www.instagram.com/podcastliberateyoursoul/ 12 min 11/15/2024 173. Feeling Ungrounded? Psst..Itâs Ok Itâs not often that you hear a podcast host be radically vulnerable, but my hope is that by sharing what Iâve felt lately will help you feel less alone and gather some steps for yourself to feel more grounded and certain. Itâs ok to not be ok just as much as it is for you to feel amazing, so whatever you are feeling, just be in it for a little while! Itâs all part of the process of upleveling and growing in your self-concept and what you expect out of life. Like a slingshot must sometimes pull back to launch, sometimes we do too! Ready to jump on a clarity call to get clear on what you want? Send me an email to info@quantumhighways.com. 21 min 11/04/2024 172. Allow Myself to Introduceâ¦Myself Austin Powers Fans, where are you at? Todayâs episode is a little untethered, not to be confused with unhinged â but itâs a glimpse into a little more about me and what Iâm about, how I got here, and what I hope for you in your life as we all spin around on this little blue/green orb called earth. Iâd love to hear from you, send me an email at: info@quantumhighways.com. 32 min 10/27/2024 171. Turbulent Times â Putting God Back on the Throne Have you found yourself spinning out in worry over things that you canât control like the election? God gave me a word to settle my spirit back during Hurricane Milton (which turned into hundreds of baby tornados â TERRIFYING!) but I think it applies for us as we face the coming general election and all the turmoil that life can give us. I hope this blesses you in many ways and am happy to hop on a zoom call with you if you feel ready to step into the next level journey of your life. Send me an email at: info@quantumhighways.com and we will set up a time to chat. Hang in there, know that itâs going to be ok! 21 min 10/19/2024 170. Healing Hangover â Being Ok With Being Ok I donât like to call them healing crisisâ because that feels a little too dissonant from the beauty of healing. But sometimes right after we feel the peak vibrational energy of joy and acceptance we can drop back down into old habits of anxiety, fear, overwhelm, all the emotions and it feels so hard! Growing up in chaos, dysfunction, or trauma, we get used to the vibration of whatever emotion we internalized, and when that gets released our mind story can tell us we are not ok, look at all the things that are wrong, etc. Iâm sharing how I got through the most recent bout of this and what you can do to lead yourself to compassionate acceptance of being ok too. Iâd love to hear about your journey, send me an email at info@quantumhighways.com to connect! 20 min 10/10/2024 169. Going Deep Within For Wisdom & Peace The Inner Voice is a well of wisdom from deep within that we all have and can tune into in different ways. Like when you just know not to go a certain route to work or avoid a situation because you âhad a feelingâ. At the end of this episode I share a snippet of a session that I recently had that helped me come to a decision that will set up the next direction in life I want to take. It was life changing! We all have choices to make each day on how we are going to perceive our experiences, the habits we have, the thoughts we think, and the feelings we feel, but it is up to US to make those choices. Life can either be a tragedy or a comedy, but it is in the small moments that awareness can come, and knowing we get the opportunity to choose again and again is so liberating. Whether itâs help making a big decision, clearing up trauma, recognizing your own limiting beliefs, finding romance, health, or wealth, your inner voice will provide the way for you in your life adventure. To book an inner voice session for yourself, send me an email at: info@quantumhighways.com and we will get you all set up. Have a beautiful week! 21 min 10/01/2024 168. Feeling the Flow: Getting Into Realtime Day to Day Today is a short and sweet episode (like me!) on how to get into the flow of life and using the Newtonian law of motion to get things going and stay flowing with less effort and more things going; as well as how to get âunstuckâ to be in touch with your innate connectedness with so much less resistance. Really not letting anything get you down, whether doubts, distractions, giving away your power, or chasing something that isnât a lifetime constant reality but meant to be a moment of divine ecstasy â living life as it comes and feeling yourself here in the flow of life it is something that will help you feel so much more expanded and less scattered than ever.

Radically Shift Your Life With This Simple Phrase How we look at the people, things, and circumstances in our life relative to ourselves has a huge impact on what we get out of life. Iâm here to share that you donât need to completely give up on the major goals you have, nor are you that far off if you stop and think about it. Get ready to commit to taking easy actionable steps toward creating the life you want, after you shift from feeling left out, to determined to live a life with purpose.
