I don't want to rebuild him constantly. He is 5* blessed in cruelty right now. Will move to CR at 6*, and has a cats gaze at level 5. gear is six piece merciless, 2 piece cruel Build 1: Def: 7802 Spd: 219 CD: 358 ACC: 250 Build 2: Def: 7408 * Spd: 203 * CD: 358 ACC: 375 * The difference is in an ACC/ACC banner (banner with acc ascension) that trades for a faster DEF/DEF banner. I think in principle I can make up some of the defense by rerolling his glove and chest piece, which have bad ascension rolls (both flat def) to something like cd/def or def acc. The problem is that 50% extra accuracy isnt going to get him high enough (562 ACC) to debuff heroes with real resistance. So I think it might be better to just let ACC be lower (375 with the acc buff) and buff defense by the extra 400ish defense. The problem is that the extra defense isn't adding that much damage. Should I go with build 1 or build 2? EDIT: Thank you all for your points on speed and ACC. I'll be trying to experiment with and grow him in that direction as my gear evolves. I realize now that he could definitely be taking more turns. Read more Share"
