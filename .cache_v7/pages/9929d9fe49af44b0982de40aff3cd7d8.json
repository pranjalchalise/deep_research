However, I came away disappointed with Eliezer as the representative of the pessimistic side of the conversation. Throughout the episode, Eliezer seemed to sidestep questions and struggled to articulate the opposing side in a charitable and accurate manner, even criticizing the practice of steel manning itself. I also found his inability of proposing solutions, or even accepting the existence of a solution to be deeply troubling. By his own description this is an inevitable, time sensitive, potentially catastrophic problem and we should just roll over and accept it? Overall, I was disappointed with Eliezer as a champion for the dangers of AI, and I look forward to finding a better one whether through this channel or otherwise. Despite my disappointment with Eliezer's perspective, I still appreciate the platform that Lex provides for exploring different viewpoints and fostering meaningful discussions and I eagerly await the next episode. What do you guys think? it seems this episode and Eliezer were both widely and positively accepted, am I just wrong here? Read more Share"
