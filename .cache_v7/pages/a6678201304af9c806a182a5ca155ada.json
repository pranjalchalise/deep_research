(international student here who doesn't really know alot about LAC's) I was really lucky to receive acceptances from Amherst College and a couple more well known universities (more well known from this part of the world at-least). At Amherst I plan on majoring in Economics and Physics and pipeline to finance. I didn't know anything about Amherst or any other LAC before this admission cycle but i grew to truly love Amherst's vibe and smaller community. On top of all of that, Amherst has also given me a massive amount of aid. I’m an international student and from where I’m from no one really knows Amherst college. My question is how prestigious is Amherst college in the States and would it provide me with the same opportunities and academic experience as a more well known university. Prestige is something that I wish I could say I didn't care about whatsoever, but I sadly do. It's not enough for me to turn down thousands of dollars of aid but still. Any advice and insights would be truly appreciated. Thank you once again! Read more Share"
