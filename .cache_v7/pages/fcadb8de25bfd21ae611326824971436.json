Bill Clark/CQ–Roll Call Inc./Getty Images A Senate committee chair has launched an investigation into what he says is a decline in how prepared freshmen accepted into selective institutions are for math courses there. Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, announced Friday that he’s sent letters to 35 institutions, including Ivy League universities, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Rice University and more. “The United States faces a crisis in student achievement at the K–12 level that has begun to spill over into higher education, especially in math,” Cassidy wrote in the letters.

He’s asking each of these institutions to provide data on freshman placement into math courses, explanations of how placements are decided, information on math classes that include precollege content, descriptions of universitywide math graduation requirements and info on whether they require the SAT, ACT or other math tests for admission.

The UC San Diego report provided some reasons for its first-year students’ math deficits. “This deterioration coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on education, the elimination of standardized testing, grade inflation, and the expansion of admissions from under-resourced high schools,” the report said. “The combination of these factors has produced an incoming class increasingly unprepared.” Advertisement Editor's Picks Florida Introduces ‘Sanitized’ Sociology Textbook UNC Plans to Define Academic Freedom—and Its Limits State H-1B Visa Pauses Are ‘Reckless,’ Faculty Warn Want articles like this sent straight to your inbox ?
