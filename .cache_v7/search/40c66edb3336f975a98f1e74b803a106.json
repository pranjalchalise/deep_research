Jordan, the fourth child of Deloris and James, has four siblings: James Jr. (known as Ronnie), Deloris, Larry, and Roslyn.\n\nGrowing up in Wilmington, North Carolina, Jordan developed a competitive edge at an early age.

The Gatorade partnership featured a memorable ad campaign encouraging kids and adults to “Be Like Mike.”\n\nIn 1998, Jordan launched into the restaurant business as the owner of Michael Jordan’s The Steak House N.Y.C.
