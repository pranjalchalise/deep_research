      "snippet": "Dana Zahorik, Peer Advising & Mentoring Commission Chair\n\nDana Zahorik.jpgPeer advising supports the achievement of key institutional priorities, including student retention and persistence, promotion of student success, and helping students to meet their career goals. As the economy continues to waver, the number of students enrolling at our institutions climbs as dislocated workers return to college and younger students seek to lower their loan indebtedness by taking classes while living at home. These students bring with them a different set of needs that challenge us to provide effective advising services. Institutions must react and adjust advising services if we are to meet the needs of our changing student populations. Peer advisors can be an integral part of the solution. [...] Students are working more and going to school less. The number of full-time students at many institutions has declined. Summer enrollment in general has increased (Brown, 2008), and the number of students enrolled in distance education courses has increased. Working students require increased flexibility and the number of dislocated workers entering college has soared. As a result, more students are balancing employment with attending college. Who better to show these students how to balance multiple roles than peers who have successfully demonstrated that they can succeed in college? When successful peers make a simple connection with entering students, they become the important mentor needed for student persistence. [...] The informal trust system built between students and peer advisors is something faculty and staff cannot replicate. This trust is a resource that can be used to promote student success. Peer advisors have successfully walked in these students’ shoes and are willing to give back what they received from fellow peers.  Peer advising can provide an invaluable resource to the institutions and the changing student populations we serve\n\nDana Zahorik  \nAcademic Counselor  \nFox Valley Technical College (/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#510b30393e23383a11372725327f343524)\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, L.C.

      "snippet": "The near-peer advisor role provides students who typically have limited access to career-related internships an opportunity to explore a range of possible careers, a space to try out specific roles, and mentors who can guide them through the challenges of defining their career pathway. Designing the role as a multiyear experience affords near-peer advisors the chance to construct an informed vision for their professional future. For young people who must work while they attend college, the fact that these positions are paid allows them to work in jobs that propel their careers, in positive and affirming ways, while also helping them cover costs while in college.

High school counselors serving fewer students are more likely to help them with critical access and retention tasks, less likely to leave the field due to burnout, and produce better outcomes.13 For college students, caranyc.org | 8 Impact 1: Increasing Postsecondary Support for Students Near-Peer Advisors Narrow the Guidance Gap CURRENT NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR-TO-STUDENT RATIO CURRENT COLLEGE LEVEL ADVISOR-TO-STUDENT RATIO CURRENT COLLEGE LEVEL RATIO CAREER ADVISOR-TO-STUDENT In some instances, caseloads reach as high as 900 students. [...] The Triple Impact of Peer-to-Peer Postsecondary Advising Programs “Being a near-peer advisor helped me navigate the system not only for myself, but also for my family… I still use the skills I learned to help my community apply to college.” - Jazmin, former near-peer advisor It is not easy for any student to navigate through a college and career pathway. It is a complicated journey marked by hard-to-answer questions, bureaucratic obstacles, and challenging decisions. Students from middle- and upper-income backgrounds typically have the resources needed to guide them along this bumpy road, while students from under-resourced backgrounds—whose road is bumpier—typically do not. All students need strong guidance and meaningful career exploration and development opportunities along the way,"

Integrating Career Advising For Equitable Student Success | INTRODUCTION 13 THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE Over the last five years, multiple efforts have been made to transform the future of career advising practices on colleges campuses, and in the last two years, integrating career advising into other advising contexts has emerged as a need.7 While deeper sophistication and understanding of how to integrate career advising is a recent trend, there is some historical precedence that can inform the future. Career advising and other types of [...] and recommended practices. A review of multiple studies and reports in the last two decades shows two primary narratives as relates to integrating career advising toward equitable student success. The first includes numerous studies about student success with a notable absence of career advising. Turn of the century resources about persistence8 and graduation rates framed a new student success equity paradigm and provided results for campus administrators that would shape student success practices.9 However, the research negates the importance of career advising. The absence of career advising in this research has shaped higher education in some cases, leaving career advising out of the equation for student success at many institutions.
