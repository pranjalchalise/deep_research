      "snippet": "She decided a regression would help her understand the origin of her overwhelming fear of even discussing the issue with her husband. [...] As time passed, the vibrant young girl became a depressed, frustrated woman with no outlets for her energy, intelligence, or outgoing personality. In desperation, she ran away to Paris, hoping to start over in the city she loved. Tragically, her husband became outraged at her departure, discovered her whereabouts, and killed her.\n\nWhen this memory surfaced, Pat understood her inordinate fear of addressing the issue with her husband and her anxiety about surviving financially on her own. She worked through her fears, and everyone gained from the situation.\n\nTravel [...] The content of these vivid dreams included detailed settings and clothing from distinct eras in Palestine, Egypt, France, and Africa. In them she was clearly shown that she and her new friend shared a special bond and that they had been involved in a variety of spiritual practices and forms of healing in many prior lifetimes. As a result of sharing and examining Vanessa’s dreams together, their current relationship blossomed. They share a commitment to express creatively the spiritual insights and intuitive abilities garnered from those previous lifetimes as well as to develop and apply their present talents in service to others.\n\nBody Work"

Often called an “Indian Gypsy” or “snake charmers’ folk” dance, its contemporary form emerged through national and transnational influences. My PhD research (2012–2016) with Kālbeliyā dancer families revealed how this practice was shaped to create new livelihoods and commercial opportunities. Since its stage adaptation in the 1980s, Kālbeliyā dance has become a sought-after art form in global performance circuits. This international success has led to a growing phenomenon: non-Indian women increasingly learn, perform, and professionalize in Kālbeliyā dance. Today, hundreds practitioners outside India—from Chile to Japan—outnumber the [...] dance influences global discussions on neo-Orientalism, gender, social stratification, and economic sustainability."
