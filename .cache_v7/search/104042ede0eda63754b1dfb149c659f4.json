      "snippet": "One of Sproul's mentors was John H. Gerstner, being one of his professors at Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. The two of them, along with Arthur Lindsley, another of Gerstner's students, co-authored the book Classical Apologetics in 1984. Sproul's ministry, Ligonier Ministries, made recordings of Gerstner teaching various courses on theology and the Bible. John M. Frame \"John Frame (theologian)\") records that Gerstner was Sproul's \"main intellectual influence.\"\n\nSproul recalls encountering theological opposition inside a liberal environment during his early studies: [...] Robert Charles Sproul (/sproʊl/ SPROHL; February 13, 1939 – December 14, 2017) was an American Reformed theologian, Christian apologist, and ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America. He was the founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, and could be heard daily on the Renewing Your Mind radio broadcast internationally. [...] Some of Sproul's best-known books are The Holiness of God, Essential Truths of the Christian Faith, and What Is Reformed Theology? He is also well known for Chosen by God, a book about predestination and the sovereignty of God. Through Ligonier Ministries and the Renewing Your Mind radio program and conferences, Sproul generated numerous audio and video lectures on the subjects of history of philosophy, theology, Bible study, apologetics, intelligent design, and Christian living. In addition, Sproul wrote more than 100 books and many articles for evangelical publications. He signed the 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, which affirmed the traditional view of Biblical inerrancy, and he wrote a commentary on that document titled Explaining Inerrancy. He also served as the general"

      "snippet": "Albert Mohler  \nR.C. Sproul was an evangelist. “Evangelism is our duty. God commanded it,” he taught: “But there is more. Evangelism is not only a duty; it is also a privilege. God allows us to participate in the greatest work in human history, the work of redemption.” There will be many saints in heaven who came to hear the gospel through R.C.’s talks, sermons, videos, conferences, books, and personal witnessing.\n\nJustin Taylor  \nToday, R.C. Sproul—a sinner saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ based on Scripture alone for the glory of God alone—is seeing his Savior face to face, and hearing the words we all long to hear: “Well done, my good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Master.” [...] John Piper  \nI love R.C. Sproul. I am sure I owe him more than I can even recall. My reverence for the holiness of God and the truth of his word would not be the same without his influence. I will miss him (for a short while).\n\nJohn MacArthur  \nNo nationally known Christian leader has been a better friend to me than R. C. Sproul. He stood by my side for decades in every major theological controversy I was engaged in. More than I could ever express, I appreciated his willingness to confront important controversies without flinching. [...] Ligon Duncan  \nNo figure in our generation has done more than R. C. to defend, proclaim, and expound Luther’s insights into the Bible’s teaching on justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. I have met young people on every continent who readily confess their indebtedness to R. C. Sproul (though they have never met him or heard him in person), through the various media of Ligonier Ministries, books, articles, magazines, audio, video, app, and conferences. He is responsible for introducing a generation to the authority of Scripture, the sovereignty of God, and the glory of the Gospel of justification by faith, salvation by grace, in Christ alone."

      "snippet": "One interesting footnote to this is that the first man John Knox ordained into the ministry of the church was an obscure clergyman by the name of Robert Charles Sproul, of whom I am a direct descendant.\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Reformation spread to the new world with the arrival of the Pilgrims and colonies of Puritans who brought Reformed theology and the Geneva Bible with them.\n\nReformation theology dominated Protestant evangelicalism for decades but became diluted later under influences of Pietism and Finneyism.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, Reformation theology declined dramatically in the Western world, being assaulted by 19th-century liberal theology on the one hand, and the influence of Arminian theology on the other. This was especially true in America."

      "snippet": "Dr. Sproul has helped provide solid theological resources for the well-being of the church for over 40 years. Ligonier Ministries has introduced us to many–if not most–of the great theologians of our day. The National Conference has been a staple in the lives of a myriad of ministers and congregants alike for decades. Add to this the impact of the Reformation Study Bible, the many Reformation Trust volumes, Ligonier Academy, RefNet, the Ligonier blog and, of course, the celebrated Tabletalk Magazine. Furthermore, the way in which the lives of men and women have been impacted through Ligonier’s partnership with various prison ministries is immeasurable. [...] Reply\n\n    Great tribute! I could say all the same things and more. Dr. Sproul has, without question, been the number one influence in my Christian life. I also believe he is the primary reason for the present-day resurgence in Reformed theology. He is practically the founder of New Calvinism.\n\n    The reason I say this is because he is the only one I know who teaches Reformed theology as such. Most other Reformed pastors and teachers became known for their Reformed doctrine either through Ligonier conferences, Ligonier resource materials, Renewing Your Mind, or Tabletalk magazine. God has truly blessed the church with this remarkable teacher and I hope he remains with us for many years to come.\n11. Enoch\n\n    Reply [...] We are “sproul-mates”. 🙂\n9. Steve\n\n   Reply\n\n   While I have appreciated much of RC’s teaching over the years, I have never appreciated the exorbitant salaries (well over $200k per year) that were paid at Ligonier. It would have been wonderful to see the excellent theology paired with sacrificial living and missions trips instead of American consumerism and cruises. And it would have been far more powerful to have heard how the truth of God permeates the difficulties of RC’s life, instead of keeping up a successful public face.\n\n   1. Ethan\n\n      Reply\n\n      “Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful” 1 Corinthians 4:2 NIV"

      "snippet": "My first exposure to R.C. Sproul was on the radio back in the early 2000s. I had an hour commute (one way) to campus out on Long Island, and I would listen to Ravi Zacharias’ “Let My People Think” on Christian radio, followed by Sproul’s Ligonier Ministry radio program. That daily ritual started my gradual movement from “Christian lite” to Reformed faith. I then read Sproul’s Chosen by God, which totally challenged my understanding of salvation and predestination. I read Defending Your Faith as part of my regular apologetics readings. I followed that with The Consequences of Ideas (which is on my WRIT 101 book review reading list here at Grove City College). I then read his What is Reformed Theology, and I was finally convicted and convinced of the basic tenets of Reformed faith. The [...] In May 1973 or 1974, I took a two-week course on apologetics taught by Sproul during the May end-session at Gordon Conwell Seminary. Each day my friend and I sat for three hours listening to Sproul and then spent four to five hours going over our notes together. One was never bored listening to Sproul. As I remember it, he went golfing most every afternoon, and had a strong relationship with Arnold Palmer (both lived in the Ligonier, PA area), who he spoke of fondly.\n\nOne can praise God for giving him to us for the 78 years that he lived. What an impact he had for the Kingdom!\n\nPaul McNulty, President of Grove City College [...] Back in the 1970s it was clear to many conservative Protestants that many evangelical scholars were rushing into cultural accommodation, and to do so they were playing fast and loose with the bedrock doctrines of biblical inerrancy and authority. Many were doing so while teaching or serving in evangelical institutions with required statements of faith which they were, effectively, violating. Meanwhile though, they would maintain all these fundamentalist behavioral standards—no cards, no smoking, no alcohol, etc. So, their theological drift was hidden underneath this veneer of piety."

Reflections on his life and legacy continue to be shared online—whether in short tweets or longer obituaries. Below is a collection of some of them. We will update this blog post over the coming days.\n\nChris Larson  \nGod called R.C. to proclaim the gospel to as many people as possible. R.C. did this knowing the Lord did not need him. In fact, he wanted people to know the enduring, faithful witness of God’s servants throughout church history. God powerfully used R.C.’s ministry in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries to awaken people around the world to the truths of classical Christianity."
