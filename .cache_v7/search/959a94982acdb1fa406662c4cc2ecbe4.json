Ill health, unattractive appearance, clumsiness of manner, and coarseness of taste did not recommend him for a public life. The imperial family seems to have considered him something of an embarrassment, and he was long left to his own private studies and amusements. It was the historian Livy who recognized and encouraged his inclination for historical studies. Claudius wrote a pamphlet defending the republican politician and orator Cicero, who was executed by the triumvirs; and, having discovered that it was difficult to speak freely on the civil wars toward the end of the Roman [...] Quick Facts\n\nIn full:\n:   Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\n\nOriginal name (until 41 CE):\n:   Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus\n\nBorn:\n:   August 1, 10 bce, Lugdunum [Lyon], Gaul\n\nDied:\n:   October 13, 54 ce\n\nTitle / Office:\n:   emperor (41-54), Roman Empire\n\nHouse / Dynasty:\n:   Julio-Claudian dynasty\n\nNotable Family Members:\n:   spouse Julia Agrippina\n:   spouse Messalina Valeria\n:   father Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus\n:   brother Germanicus\n\nRole In:\n:   Battle of the Medway\n\nOn the Web:\n:   Heritage History - The Accession of Claudius (Jan. 02, 2026)\n\nSee all related content [...] # Claudius\n\nRoman emperor\n\nAlso known as: Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus(Show More)\n\nWritten by\n\nArnaldo Dante Momigliano\n\nAlexander White Visiting Professor, University of Chicago, 1975–87.

      "snippet": "The best known fictional representation of the Emperor Claudius was contained in the books I, Claudius and Claudius the God (published in 1934 and 1935, respectively) by Robert Graves, both written in the first-person to give the reader the impression that they are Claudius's autobiography. Graves employed a fictive artifice to suggest that they were recently discovered, genuine translations of Claudius's writings. Claudius's extant letters, speeches, and sayings were incorporated into the text (mostly in the second book, Claudius the God), to add authenticity. [...] Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus While Claudius had never been formally adopted either by Augustus or his successors, he was nevertheless the grandson of Augustus's sister Octavia, and so he felt that he had the right of family. He also adopted the name \"Augustus\" as the two previous emperors had done at their accessions. He kept the honorific \"Germanicus\" to display the connection with his heroic brother and father. He deified his paternal grandmother Livia to highlight her position as wife of the divine Augustus. Claudius frequently used the term \"filius Drusi\" (son of Drusus) in his titles, to remind the people of his legendary father and lay claim to his reputation.

      "snippet": "### Early Life and Challenges\n\nTiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, commonly known as Claudius, was born in 10 BCE. He faced numerous challenges from birth, including physical ailments that led many to dismiss him as unfit for public life. His stutter and limp contributed to his frequent exclusion from the political and social circles of Roman aristocracy.\n\n### The Unlikely Ascension to the Throne\n\nDespite his disabilities, Claudius displayed a keen intellect and a thirst for knowledge. He immersed himself in scholarly pursuits, becoming a historian and author. His survival through the tumultuous reigns of his predecessors, including the infamous Caligula, was seen by many as a result of his seemingly unambitious nature."

      "snippet": "### Claudius\n\nClaudius\n\n## Claudius\n\nTiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus - known as Claudius - was born August 1, 10 BCE in Gaul. The imperial family apparently thought of him as an embarrassment, being unattractive and clumsy. However, he later explained his behavior as having been an act to benefit his brother Caligula. The historian Livy encouraged him to study history; he wrote many history books, including several about Etruscan history.\n\nAfter his brother's murder, Claudius came to power suddenly in 41 AD. He was not preferred by the Senate, but he proved to be an effective emperor. His first act was to execute his brother's assassins and their leader. He took measures to justify his authority including adopting the \"Caesar\" name, as well as \"Augustus.\" [...] Claudius was also paranoid, though not without reason. Many Senators supported a rebellion, and many attempts were made by knights and senators to assassinate Claudius, despite his returning Macedonia and Achaea to the Senate and providing new opportunities for knights. Cassius Dio tells us that he had every person searched for fear that they might be carrying a dagger. Dio also wrote that his unpopularity had more to do with the freedmen with whom he associated and the women he married than his infirmities. [...] Roman legend agrees that Agrippina, his wife at the time, poisoned Claudius on October 13, 54 AD. The politician and satirist, Lucius Annaeus Seneca, who had been exiled by Claudius, was recalled from exile by Agrippina to teach her son. Seneca mocked the dead emperor in his satire Apocolocyntosis divi Claudii, (“The Pumpkinification of the Divine Claudius”). The work describes the unpopular side of Claudius and his administration; it claims he was an unfair judge who ordered executions often, as well as a poor speaker."

      "snippet": "Claudius was born on 1 August 10 BC in Gaul (now France) into the Roman imperial family. Tiberius, the second emperor of Rome, was his uncle. Claudius suffered from physical disabilities, including a limp and a speech impediment and was therefore treated with disdain by his family, and not considered as a future emperor. When Tiberius's successor Caligula was assassinated in January 41 AD, the Praetorian Guard found Claudius in the palace and acclaimed him as emperor. The senate held out against Claudius for two days, but then accepted him."
