      "snippet": "The paper is structured as follows:\n\n •\n\n  We first describe a standard RAG architecture to establish a reference for analyzing the attack surface (Fig 1).\n •\n\n  We then reviewed scientific literature and industry reports for known RAG risks and mitigation strategies. A condensed summary is presented in section III. We analyzed and structured the fragmented literature into the risk and mitigation matrix (Table I). Finally, in section IV, Guidelines for Implementation, we integrate our RAG-specific analysis into the broader context of general security practices, and compiled a high-level framework (Fig. 2) for quick orientation.\n\n## II Background and Related Work [...] ## IV Guidelines for Implementation\n\nTo implement a secure and trusted RAG, it is essential to address all organizational and technical aspects of the system, for which we propose a holistic framework (Figure 2) that integrates the RAG-specific Risks and Mitigations with the different standards, methodologies, and best practices of the field.\n\nOur framework integrates three overarching activities, ML-Ops, Data Governance, and Project- and Risk Management, and three security-specific layers IT Baseline Protection, AI and LLM Protection, and RAG Protection. In this section we briefly discuss these components and provide references to industry standards for practitioners.\n\nThe three overarching activities provide the ground for successful and responsible AI projects. [...] Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second step, the paper develops a framework"

      "snippet": "# Project RAG Status Meanings and Best Practices\n\nProject RAG status indicators are a widely used way of communicating how work is progressing across projects and programmes. When applied consistently, they provide a clear and accessible view of overall project status for both delivery teams and organisational leaders.\n\nUnderstanding how RAG works in project management is important for maintaining effective control. Clear definitions and consistent use help ensure that issues are identified early, risks are visible, and reporting supports informed decision-making rather than reassurance.\n\nThis article explores the meaning of RAG status in practice and outlines best-practice approaches for using it as part of structured project reporting and governance.\n\nLet’s get started. [...] #### \n\n#### Project Performance\n\nEstablish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure project performance and determine the RAG status. These KPIs could include metrics such as task completion rates, quality of deliverables, and stakeholder satisfaction.\n\n###### \n\n#### Risk Assessment\n\nConduct regular risk assessments to identify potential risks and determine the RAG status. Projects with high-risk levels might be marked red, moderate risks as amber, and low risks as green.\n\nBy defining clear criteria for RAG status, project managers can ensure that project reporting is consistent, objective, and accurate. This enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and take corrective action when necessary, ultimately contributing to the successful delivery of project outcomes. [...] ## Why RAGS are useless without a road to green for project health\n\nYour project/programme highlight reports may include Red, Amber, Green (RAG) ratings. But without a RAGS road to green they won’t deliver the business benefits you seek.\n\nMost project and programme highlight reports, also known as project status reports, include one or more Red, Amber, Green (RAG) ratings.\n\nThese can signify the health of the project and also report on key aspects of the project, e.g. How committed are the stakeholders, or is the team motivated and performing?\n\nHere is an example of rags used to assess risks:\n\nPM3 Risk Matrix grid\n\nPM3 Risk Matrix grid\n\nPM3 Risk Matrix grid\n\nThese ‘sub-RAGS’ are a good way of ensuring that key aspects of the project are being managed and controlled.\n\n###"

      "snippet": "Effective responses to RAG status indicators involve:\n\n Red Status: Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the root cause of the issue. Implement immediate corrective actions, such as reallocating resources, revising timelines, or adjusting the budget. Regularly review progress to ensure improvements.\n Amber Status: Monitor the situation closely and develop a mitigation plan to prevent it from going red. This might involve additional support, minor adjustments to the project plan, or increased communication with stakeholders.\n Green Status: Maintain current practices and continue monitoring. Celebrate small wins to keep the team motivated and ensure continued progress.\n\n### Additional Best Practices [...] ### 2. Customize Your Dashboard\n\nCustomizing your dashboard involves:\n\n1. Adding Relevant Metrics: Ensure that all key metrics relevant to your project are included.\n2. Real-Time Data Updates: Incorporate features that allow for real-time data updates to keep the dashboard current.\n3. Visualization Tools: Use charts, graphs, and other visualization tools to make data interpretation easier.\n4. User-Friendly Layout: Design the dashboard with a clean and intuitive layout for easy navigation and understanding.\n\n## Best Practices for Using RAG Status in Project Management\n\n### Setting RAG Status Tolerances\n\nDefining clear tolerances and responsibilities for what constitutes red, amber, or green status is essential. This involves setting thresholds for key metrics: [...] TL;DR\n\nRAG Status is a color-coded system using Red (critical issues), Amber (needs monitoring), and Green (on track) to visualize project health. It helps project managers track key metrics like cost, schedule, scope, and risk in dashboards. Setting clear RAG thresholds and providing context enables faster decision-making and better stakeholder communication.\n\n## What is RAG Status?\n\nRAG Status stands for Red, Amber, and Green. This color-coded system provides a quick visual representation of project health, which is essential for project managers to communicate the current status of projects efficiently.\n\n## RAG Status Meaning"

      "snippet": "RAG status is part of the reporting process in project management. It’s simply a way to easily and quickly understand where a project should be at any point in the project’s life cycle. Therefore, it’s facilitated by project management software as one of its features is reporting on project metrics. ProjectManager is award-winning project and portfolio management software with powerful reporting capabilities that are easy to use and measure all aspects of the project.\n\n## Make Project Status Reports With RAG Status [...] The free status report template captures everything needed to get a well-rounded project overview. There’s a project summary with key accomplishments, completed and planned work, milestones, deliverables and action items. The section on the project health goes over budget, schedule, quality and scope. There’s even a risk management overview.\n\n## RAG Status Example\n\nLet’s view a RAG status example to better understand the RAG status and how it would look on a project report. Below is a portfolio report generated from ProjectManager. At the top, is a small chart with a list of projects.\n\nProjectManager's portfolio report with RAG status\nProjectManager's portfolio report with RAG status [...] RAG status is a way to quickly and visually communicate the status of various aspects of a project or multiple projects. By color-coding the project data, the progress and performance of the project or portfolio are more intuitive and delivered with greater efficiency. It’s a great technique for project managers to get a quick overview of the project, but also serves stakeholders, who want to know the big picture and aren’t interested in the details.\n\nUsing a RAG status facilitates understanding quickly and, in so doing, helps managers and stakeholders to target areas that require attention according to the color that it’s assigned. The red, amber or green also makes it easy to see what is on track and where actions are needed to get the areas in red up to speed."
