      "snippet": "After returning to Rome, Marius began his political career. With the help of the powerful Metelli clan, he won the election for tribune of the people in 119 b.c.e. During his tribuneship, he showed his independence by carrying a bill for election reform despite opposition from the Metelli and the Senatorial Party. In the next year Marius stood for the office of aedile but was defeated. In 115 b.c.e. he was elected praetor but only with difficulty. In the following year he was appointed propraetor for Further Spain. About the year 111 b.c.e. Marius contracted a highly favorable marriage alliance with the ancient Julian clan. His marriage to Julia, a future aunt of Julius Caesar, gave him an important link to the aristocracy.\n\n## Life’s Work [...] ## Menu\n\n# Gaius Marius\n\nGaius Marius was a significant Roman general and political leader born around 157 BCE near Arpinum, Italy. Initially a farmer's son with limited formal education, Marius excelled in military service, first fighting in Spain against the Numantines and later rising through the ranks. His political career began in the Roman Republic, where he served as tribune of the people and later as consul multiple times, notably during critical military conflicts such as the Jugurthine War and against Germanic tribes like the Cimbri and Teutons. [...] Although Marius was a successful general, he failed as politician. His successive consulships are attributable not to political adroitness but to his skill as a general at a time when Rome was severely threatened. The year 100 marked a turning point in Marius’s career. Elected consul for the sixth time and immensely popular after his recent victories, Marius devised no program for social reform beyond that of acquiring land for his veterans. Inept as a public speaker and vacillating in his political decisions, Marius allowed himself to be led by the demagogues Saturninus and Glaucia, whose radicalism and violence precipitated his fall. Driven by ambition, Marius spent the remaining years of his life trying to recover his former power and prestige. At his death, Rome had entered a new era"

      "snippet": "## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarius was an extremely successful Roman general and politician. In ancient sources, he has been repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism. Plutarch says of him:\n\n> if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age. [...] It would seem that even at this early stage of his military career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He was elected on the basis of his accomplishments, even though he was not known by sight to the electors, as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes. After election, he likely served Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus on the Balearic Islands, helping him win a triumph. Next, Marius possibly ran for the quaestorship after losing an election for local office in Arpinum. He may have stood for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to a local competitor. It is possible, however, that Marius never ran for the quaestorship at all, jumping directly to plebeian tribune. He likely participated in the major Roman victory at the Battle of the [...] many of the problems he faced during his early career in Rome show the difficulties that faced a \"new man\" (novus homo) in being accepted into the stratified upper echelons of Roman society, Marius – even as a young man – was not poor or even middle-class; he was most assuredly born into inherited wealth, gained most likely from large land holdings. In fact, his family's resources were definitely large enough to support not just one member of the family in Roman politics, but two: Marius's younger brother, Marcus Marius \"Marcus Marius (praetor 102 BC)\"), also entered Roman public life."

      "snippet": "Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the"

      "snippet": "Ancient sources suggest that Marius was pre-destined, through the visions of a seer, to be Consul of Rome seven times. Not only would this prove true, but he would eventually be hailed as the third founder of Rome, and its savior.\n\nMilitary glory and personal ambition drove Marius straight to the top of the Roman system, but perhaps even more importantly, the man and his legacy would have a profound impact on the life of his nephew, Gaius Julius Caesar.\n\nAs a youth, Marius may have used his modest family influence to join the Republican legions as a junior officer, or may have risen from the ranks. It is difficult to determine exactly, but it is known that he spent his early career in Hispania under Scipio Aemilianus, grandson of Scipio Africanus. [...] Prior to Marius, the armies may have been loyal to a general, but were fighting in theory for the survival or expansion of the state, including their own lands. After Marius, they fought for their Legate, provided they liked him of course, and for the plunder and glory he could provide.\n\nWith nowhere to return to in Rome or beyond, these new soldiers became career full-time professional soldiers, serving terms from 20 to 25 years. A whole new class of citizen was developed from this simple change in military philosophy. [...] For Marius, however, his political career was coming to a temporary end. The Senate recalled Metellus, despite objections by Marius, and he knew life in Rome was getting to be too dangerous for him to stay.\n\nAt the close of his Consulship, when a former magistrate could become legally liable for actions taken during his term, Marius went into a form of self-imposed exile. Satisfying the anger of the Senate, he took a voluntary leave and went east. But while his reputation as a politician in Rome was crumbling, Marius the general was a different matter."

      "snippet": "IV. Now it is said that Marius, mainly encouraged by these words, which he viewed as a divine intimation, entered on a political career, and obtained the tribuneship, in which he was assisted by Cæcilius Metellus, of whose house the family of Marius had long been an adherent. During his tribuneship, Marius proposed a law on the mode of voting, which apparently tended to deprive the nobles of their power in the Judicia: the measure was opposed by Cotta, the consul, who persuaded the Senate to resist the proposed law, and to summon Marius to account for his conduct. The decree proposed by Cotta was drawn up, and Marius appeared before the Senate; but so far from being disconcerted, as a young man might naturally be, who without any advantages had just stepped into public life, he already [...] VI. During his prætorship Marius got only a moderate degree of credit. But on the expiration of his office, he obtained by lot the further province of Iberia (Spain), and it is said that during his command he cleared all the robber establishments out of his government, which was still an uncivilized country in its habits and in a savage state, as the Iberians had not yet ceased to consider robbery as no dishonorable occupation. Though Marius had now embarked on a public career, he had neither wealth nor eloquence, by means of which those who then held the chief power were used to manage the people. But the resoluteness of his character, and his enduring perseverance in toil, and his plain manner of living, got him the popular favor, and he increased in estimation and influence, so as to [...] ## Gaius Marius\n\nGaius Marius (c. 157 BCE – 86 BCE) was a Roman general and politician who, in his early military career, had served under Scipio Aemilianus (of Third Punic War fame) in an expedition to Numantia in Iberia. He went on to have a distinguished military and political career, but not without controversy. As you will see from the excerpts from Plutarch’s Parallel Lives below, Marius was ambitious, and what was known as a novo homo or “new man” (one who was the first in his family to serve in the Senate and be elected consul). His policies leaned decidedly towards the poulares which also made him enemies among the senators who supported the optimates faction.\n\n### Life of Gaius Marius (excerpts) by Plutarch"

      "snippet": "So who was Gaius Marius?\n\nHumble origins\n\nMarius started out in an equestrian family which, despite relative affluence, remained outside of Rome’s snobbish aristocracy. He married into a rich family, which gave him the political patronage he needed to become a tribune in 119 BC and a praetor in 115 BC. Serving as a governor in one of Rome’s Spanish provinces, Marius gained priceless military experience from his counter-insurgency campaigns against Rome’s tribal enemies. Carefully and meticulously, the Roman governor studied the hit-and-run tactics of his foes, allowing him to master the art of conquest. [...] Today’s article looks at both the beginning and end of things: Marius’ (comparatively) humble origins, his unconventional strategies, soaring political career, and ultimately his devastating conflicts with Sulla.\n\nSo, I suppose the question now is… whose side would you have been on?\n\nAll the best,\n\nSean Kelly\n\nManaging Editor\n\nClassical Wisdom\n\nBecome A Member!

Shehadi\n\nHe was one of the most important figures in all of ancient Roman history, rivaling even Julius Caesar or Cicero. [...] Marius further distinguished himself by serving as a junior military officer in the Jugurthine War in 109 BC. Exploiting his military prestige, the unorthodox Marius broke from tradition by running for the consulship in 107 BC. To bolster his electoral prospects, Marius presented himself as a true man of the people. He styled himself as a populist, whose personal competence and merit outshone the arbitrary privileges of Rome’s archaic aristocracy. “They may look down on my humble origins,” the gruff general remarked of Rome’s aristocrats, “but I have nothing but disdain for their idleness.”\n\nShare"
