This page will give you an introduction to 80% of the React concepts that you will use on a daily basis.\n\n### You will learn\n\n How to create and nest components\n How to add markup and styles\n How to display data\n How to render conditions and lists\n How to respond to events and update the screen\n How to share data between components\n\n## Creating and nesting components\n\nReact apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.\n\nReact components are JavaScript functions that return markup:\n\n```\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n\nreturn (\n\n<button>I'm a buttonbutton>\n\n);\n\n}\n\n``` [...] Fork\n\n```\nimport{useState} from 'react'; export default function MyApp(){const[count, setCount] useState(0); function handleClick(){setCount(count 1);} return(< div>< h1> h1>< MyButton count{count} onClick{handleClick}/>< MyButton count{count} onClick{handleClick}/> div>);} function MyButton({count, onClick}){return(< button onClick{onClick}>{count} button>);}\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nBy now, you know the basics of how to write React code!\n\nCheck out the Tutorial to put them into practice and build your first mini-app with React.\n\nNextTutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe\n\n--- [...] ## Using Hooks\n\nFunctions starting with `use` are called Hooks. `useState` is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the API reference. You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.\n\nHooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use `useState` in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.\n\n## Sharing data between components\n\nIn the previous example, each `MyButton` had its own independent `count`, and when each button was clicked, only the `count` for the button clicked changed:\n\nHowever, often you’ll need components to share data and always update together."

In the CodeSandbox tab you opened earlier, press the top-left corner button to open the menu, and then choose Download Sandbox in that menu to download an archive of the files locally\n3. Unzip the archive, then open a terminal and `cd` to the directory you unzipped\n4. Install the dependencies with `npm install`\n5. Run `npm start` to start a local server and follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser\n\nIf you get stuck, don’t let this stop you! Follow along online instead and try a local setup again later.\n\n## Overview\n\nNow that you’re set up, let’s get an overview of React!\n\n### Inspecting the starter code\n\nIn CodeSandbox you’ll see three main sections: [...] {user.name}: {user.taskCount} tasks left\n\nli>\n\n```\n\nWhen a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item’s key and searches the previous list’s items for a matching key. If the current list has a key that didn’t exist before, React creates a component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys match, the corresponding component is moved.\n\nKeys tell React about the identity of each component, which allows React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component’s key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new state. [...] import './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\n```\n\nLines 1-5 bring all the necessary pieces together:\n\n React\n React’s library to talk to web browsers (React DOM)\n the styles for your components\n the component you created in `App.js`.\n\nThe remainder of the file brings all the pieces together and injects the final product into `index.html` in the `public` folder.\n\n### Building the board\n\nLet’s get back to `App.js`. This is where you’ll spend the rest of the tutorial.\n\nCurrently the board is only a single square, but you need nine! If you just try and copy paste your square to make two squares like this:\n\n```\n\nexport default function Square() {\n\nreturn <button className=\"square\">Xbutton><button className=\"square\">X</button>;\n\n}\n\n```\n\nYou’ll get this error:\n\nConsole"

      "snippet": "You may use the Yarn package manager as an alternative to npm but we'll assume you're using npm in this set of tutorials. See Package management basics for more information on npm and yarn.\n\nIf you're using Windows, you will need to install some software to give you parity with Unix/macOS terminal in order to use the terminal commands mentioned in this tutorial. Git Bash (which comes as part of the git for Windows toolset) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) are both suitable. See Command line crash course for more information on these, and on terminal commands in general.\n\nAlso bear in mind that React and ReactDOM produce apps that only work on a fairly modern set of browsers like Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Chrome when working through these tutorials. [...] ### Application structure\n\nVite gives us everything we need to develop a React application. Its initial file structure looks like this:\n\n```\nmoz-todo-react ├── README.md ├── index.html ├── node_modules ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json ├── public │ └── vite.svg ├── src │ ├── App.css │ ├── App.jsx │ ├── assets │ │ └── react.svg │ ├── index.css │ └── main.jsx └── vite.config.js \n```\n\n`index.html` is the most important top-level file. Vite injects your code into this file so that your browser can run it. You won't need to edit this file during our tutorial, but you should change the text inside the  element in this file to reflect the title of your application. Accurate page titles are important for accessibility. [...] In React:\n\n Components can import modules they need and must export themselves at the bottom of their files.\n Component functions are named with PascalCase.\n You can render JavaScript expressions in JSX by putting them between curly braces, like {so}.\n Some JSX attributes are different than HTML attributes so that they don't conflict with JavaScript reserved words. For example, class in HTML translates to className in JSX.\n Props are written just like attributes inside component calls and are passed into components.\n\n## See also\n\nLearn React MDN learning partner\n:   Scrimba's Learn React course is the ultimate React 101 — the perfect starting point for any React beginner.

You may only want to add a few \"sprinkles of interactivity\" to a web page and not need build tooling. You can add a React component by just adding a plain  tag on an HTML page. Follow the \"Add React in One Minute\" steps in the React docs. [...] # React overview\n\n## What is React JS?\n\nReact is an open-source JavaScript library for building front end user interfaces. Unlike other JavaScript libraries that provide a full application framework, React is focused solely on creating application views through encapsulated units called components that maintain state and generate UI elements. You can place an individual component on a web page or nest hierarchies of components to create a complex UI."

      "snippet": "## Defining a component\n\nTraditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Here’s what that looks like (you can edit the example below):\n\nFork\n\n```\nexport default function Profile(){return(< img src\" alt \"Katherine Johnson\"/>)}\n```\n\nAnd here’s how to build a component:\n\n### Step 1: Export the component [...] Learn React\n\nDescribing the UI\n\n# Your First Component\n\nComponents are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!\n\n### You will learn\n\n What a component is\n What role components play in a React application\n How to write your first React component\n\n## Components: UI building blocks\n\nOn the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like  and :\n\n```\n\n<article>\n\n<h1>My First Componenth1>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>Components: UI Building Blocksli>\n\n<li>Defining a Componentli>\n\n<li>Using a Componentli>\n\nol>\n\narticle>\n\n``` [...] section>\n\n```\n\n### Nesting and organizing components\n\nComponents are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move `Profile` to a separate file. You will learn how to do this shortly on the page about imports.\n\nBecause the `Profile` components are rendered inside `Gallery`—even several times!—we can say that `Gallery` is a parent component, rendering each `Profile` as a “child”. This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like.\n\n### Pitfall\n\nComponents can render other components, but you must never nest their definitions:\n\n```"
