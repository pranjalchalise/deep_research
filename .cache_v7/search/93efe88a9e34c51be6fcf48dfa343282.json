      "snippet": "One way to evaluate Lee’s performance is to compare his stewardship of Washington College with another troubled private college in the Old Dominion in the same period, the College of William and Mary (W&M).  It was the second-oldest college in the country, one attended by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Marshall. [...] President Robert E. Lee played an important and critical role in the development of Washington College after the Civil War. He expanded enrollment, enhanced the endowment, transformed the curriculum, and established a code of honor and conduct for students. Without President Lee’s unique personal contributions, Washington College would never have become the prosperous and highly-regarded Washington and Lee University of modern times.\n\nIndeed, leaders of the North and South hailed President Lee’s contributions to higher education and national reconciliation on the occasion of the centennial of his birth in 1907. [...] As president of Washington College, Lee promoted reconciliation and racial tolerance.   When on several occasions students scuffled with Blacks in the Freedmen’s program, Lee promptly investigated and expelled the offending students.  Lee’s contemporaries insisted that he maintained the policy of expelling any students who might participate in attempts to punish Negroes.  When Lee heard a report that students might attempt to lynch a Black, involved in a shooting, the general urged students “to abstain from any violation of the law.”(#_ftn17)"

      "snippet": "If General Lee had lived longer and the funds had been found, still other educational ideals doubtless would have been developed at Washington College. As it was, the program of 1869 represents the scene at its widest before the curtain dropped. To summarize, General Lee took a college whose president and four professors, prior to his coming, had been teaching Greek, Latin, \"Natural Philosophy,\" Mathematics, and \"Moral Philosophy\" to a handful of boys, and he either enlarged, or planned to enlarge this institution to this general plan:\n\nI. A classical college, with a Christian atmosphere, elective courses, and high standards, presenting the cultural studies as the \"foundation of a solid education.\" [...] Complete harmony and the utmost energy, in Joynes's phrase, pervaded the college.⁠54 The faculty did not labor in vain or follow to no purpose the leader­ship of the president. Washington College became a mighty force in Southern education and, through its engineering school, was largely the inspiration of the men who developed the steel industry in the South.⁠55 Defeated in war, Lee triumphed in his labor to upbuild the South. [...] The educational ideal of Washington College was not expressed solely in a formal curriculum and in the development of a more extended range of study. The college believed, also, in the physical training of youth. At a time when the trustees were searching for money with which to establish new departments, they considered the purchase of a playground, an \"athletic field\" in modern collegiate phraseology. And when they scarcely were able to provide money for needed laboratory equipment, the trustees cheerfully appropriated $1100 to equip a students' boat club.⁠38 The literary societies were equally esteemed. \"There is scarcely a feature in the organization of the college,\" wrote General Lee, \"more improving or beneficial to the students than the exercises and influence of the societies. . ."

The school had fallen into ruin during the Civil War, but Lee, through his reputation and actions, raised it to the first rank of Southern and National Universities. He dramatically increased enrollment, modernized the curriculum, raised money in both North and South, and carried out a building program. He helped to bring the Lexington Law School into the college, thus creating a university. Many of his innovations, such as the establishment of journalism and business programs, were among the first in the nation and were copied by other schools. Lee also supported the establishment of a public school system in Virginia [...] and was a skilled surveyor. He promoted the liberal arts, practical education, and moral education, much like Robert E. Lee. In his farewell address, Washington called for a public education system throughout the country and for a national university. He stated that American leaders needed to \"promote . . . institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge\" and that \"It is essential that public opinion should be enlightened\" both for the economy to prosper and to support democratic government. Washington also supported new and existing schools. The first of these was Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland. When the college was founded in 1782, Washington consented to have the school named after him, provided financial support, and served on the college's Board of Visitors and [...] character of an honest man. Associate yourself with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation. Be courteous to all, but intimate with few. Robert E. Lee was better educated in a formal sense than George Washington, but both valued and promoted education broadly. Lee was provided with excellent tutors as a young man and graduated at the top of his class from the United States Military Academy. Like Washington, Lee was a believer in practical education. Whereas Washington was a surveyor, Lee was an engineer, a closely related profession. He also served as Superintendent of West Point in the 1840's. Lee's most important contributions as an educator came at Washington College in the period from 1865-1870. His actions there had implications for southern and national education more"

Lee accepted the termination of slavery provided for by the Thirteenth Amendment, but opposed racial equality for African Americans. After his death in 1870, Lee became a cultural icon in the South and is largely hailed as one of the Civil War's greatest generals. As commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, he fought most of his battles against armies of significantly larger size, and managed to win many of them.

      "snippet": "The circumstances of Lee's presidency of Washington College decision are central to understanding why the trustees later added Lee to the name of the school. Lee accepted the leadership of Washington College in 1865. The war had reduced the number of students to 40.57 The college was \"perilously in debt\" and had not paid faculty salaries in years.58 It had degenerated into little more than a struggling prep school.59 Lee encouraged a new sense of the purpose of higher education in the South. He believed that \"education could in fact prepare young people for life in the world, beyond service to church or state.\"60 A \"report of the faculty\" signed by Lee and the professors and submitted to the trustees in 1867 set in motion a \"practical reconstruction\" of the academic program.61 With an [...] If we return to the earlier question, \"How should Lee be regarded?\" we can see that Lee's priority as president was to create a serious educational program undertaken in a spirit of regard for personal integrity and honesty. It was designed to give young men the skills to contribute to a war-torn society that needed rebuilding in every sense. Although Lee had this practical vision for the education of young whites, he \"never made the transformational leap that would recognize the fundamental human nature of the slaves.\"87 On slavery, he accepted \"an elaborate middle ground that acknowledged its faults but justified its existence.\"88 Washington and Lee University has an opportunity to encourage students to make the \"transformational leap\" that Lee did not make. Among its many goals, a [...] Lee died of a stroke in October 1870. Within weeks, the trustees announced that the new president would be Lee's son, General G.W. Custis Lee, then a professor at Virginia Military Institute. The trustees simultaneously announced the renaming of Washington College as Washington and Lee University.82 Thirteen years later, an addition to the rear of the chapel was opened to the public, and at its center was a statue of the recumbent general, asleep on a battlefield.83 This was the start of the chapel's fame as \"the shrine of the South.\"84 Many saw the chapel and statue as icons of the Lost Cause, their term for an idealized Southern civilization that they said had been lost in the Civil War.85 The Lost Cause narrative absolved slavery of a causal role in the war, and equated Lee to a"

      "snippet": "58 Cf. Lee to Captain A. P. Pfifer, MS., June 15, 1869: \"The regulation of Washington College, which allows and encourages young men to reside in the town of Lexington is considered by us to be very advantageous to the students themselves. It separates them into small groups, where they are removed from the temptations that may be incident to the residence of large bodies of young men in the same building, and it brings [them] under the influence of family life and associations, which we regard as very useful both to their morals and their manners. The policy of the Faculty is rather to encourage students, especially the younger ones, to board in this way, and the result we think has been very favorable. Board and lodging can be had for students in the most respectable families of [...] It was never so in anything else, either while the boys were in college or thereafter. For Lee's influence over his students did not end when he handed them their degrees and declared them graduates of Washington College. It followed them and helped to shape their lives through the difficult years of poverty that preceded the South's recovery. To this day there remains a thinning company whose proudest boast is that its members were General Lee's \"boys\" at Lexington. They have not forgotten that he said of them: \"My only object is to endeavor to make them see their true interest, to teach them to labor diligently for their improvement, and to prepare themselves for the great work of life.\"⁠110 And again: \"I have a self-imposed task, which I must accomplish. I have led the young men of the [...] Few as were the evidences of Lee's discipline, it was effective with the students.⁠105 He \"had the power to bring out,\" wrote one of his boys, years after, \"and did bring out, the very best that there was in every student.\"⁠106 \"No college in the land,\" asserted one of the ministers who served at the chapel, \"had a harder-working Faculty or a better-behaved, more orderly set of students.\"⁠107 Said one of his professors: \"We doubt . . . whether at any other college in the world so many young men could have been found as free from misconduct, or marked by as high a tone of feeling and opinion, as were the students of Washington College during these latter years of General Lee's life.\"108"
