Post-war reconstruction under the communist regime beginning in 1947 led to the nationalization of clubs, stripping private ownership and aligning them with state institutions—for instance, the army-backed Clubul Central al Armatei (CCA) was rebranded as Steaua București in 1961, symbolizing the regime's integration of sport into military and ideological frameworks.
