      "snippet": "Other reforms attributed to Marius include the abolition of the citizen cavalry and light infantry, a redesign of the pilum, a standardised eagle standard \"Aquila (Roman)\") for all legions, and the substitution of the cohort \"Cohort (military unit)\") for the maniple \"Maniple (military unit)\"). There is little evidence for the abolition of the citizen cavalry and light infantry by the first century BC, as they are still attested in evidence. If Marius redesigned the pilum, archaeological finds indicate his design was soon discarded. Literary evidence indicates that eagle standards continued to co-exist through the late republic with other traditional animal standards including the ox and wolf. Lastly, there is no ancient evidence that Marius introduced the cohort; Sallust's narrative gives [...] In the 19th century, Marius was credited with the so-called Marian reforms, including the shift from militia levies to a professional soldiery; improvements to the pilum (a kind of javelin); and changes to the logistical structure of the Roman army. Twenty-first-century historians generally view the notion as \"a construct of modern scholarship.\"\n\n## Life\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early career\n\n[edit] [...] Gaius Marius (Latin: (/wiki/Help:IPA/Latin \"Help:IPA/Latin\"); c. 157 BC – 13 January 86 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times. Rising from a family of smallholders in a village called Ceraetae in the district of Arpinum, Marius acquired his initial military experience serving with Scipio Aemilianus at the Siege of Numantia in 134 BC. He won election as tribune of the plebs in 119 BC and passed a law limiting aristocratic interference in elections. Barely elected praetor in 115 BC, he next became the governor of Further Spain where he campaigned against bandits."

      "snippet": "This paper examines three events where the political impact of Marius’s military reforms is most evident in contributing to the decline of the Roman Republic. The three events are Sulla’s and Caesar’s dictatorships, and the Catiline conspiracy. Marius’s military reforms contributed to the decline of the Roman Republic by allowing generals to use the giving of land as a pension to gain the 1 Richard Edwin Smith, The Failure of the Roman Republic (New York: Arno Press, 1975), 102. 3 loyalty of the troops, whom they used as a political weapon against their enemies in order to gain control of the State.

The population was organized into five [...] this when he says, “The soldiers felt an attachment to their general rather than to their country, and if he failed to attract their loyalty, than the love of country did not fill the gap.”18 After the Germanic and Celtic tribes were defeated, Marius became the first general to negotiate with the Senate for a retirement plan for his soldiers. Marius persuaded the Senate to give his soldiers land, which he based off of the early Republic’s practice of giving distinguished soldiers plots of land.19 With this one act and the reorganization of the army, Marius contributed to the decline of the Roman Republic. The opening up of the military to the capite censi and the 17 Keppie, Making of Roman Army, 61. 18 Smith, Failure of Roman Republic, 128. 19Keppie, Making of Roman Army, 55. 9 granting [...] contributed to the decline of the Roman Republic, by allowing generals to use the giving of land as pension to gain the loyalty of the troops, whom they used as a political weapon against their enemies in order to gain control of the State. Marius never realized the potential of his troops’ loyalty and did not use his soldiers to help him gain his repeated consulships. Generals did not use their forces to gain political power until after the Social War. Sulla was the first general to understand what could be achieved with a loyal professional army, when he marched his forces on Rome in 88 and 82 BC. Sulla used his army to put him at the head of the State in the position of dictator, which started the army’s involvement in politics. After Sulla other generals imitated his rise to power,"

      "snippet": "Although his specific actions during the conflict are not well-documented, Marius’ experience and military prowess likely contributed to the eventual Roman victory. By the end of the war, Rome agreed to grant citizenship to its Italian allies, but the conflict had further deepened the divisions within the Roman political landscape, setting the stage for the power struggles that would mark Marius’ final years.\n\n### Later Years\n\nLucius Cornelius Sulla (Photo: Print Collector via Getty Images)\n\nThe final years of Gaius Marius were marked by political turmoil and personal struggles. Following his military successes, Marius returned to Rome as a celebrated hero. [...] ### The Social War\n\nMarble bust of Gaius Marius (Photo: DEA / A. DAGLI ORTI via Getty Images)\n\nAs the flames of the Social War engulfed the Italian Peninsula, Marius found himself drawn into the fray despite his advanced age and waning health.\n\nThe Social War was a conflict that pitted the Roman Republic against its Italian allies, who were seeking Roman citizenship, and took place between 91 and 88 BC. Marius played a significant but less prominent role compared to his earlier military achievements. Despite his advanced age and declining health, Marius contributed to the Roman war effort by leading his troops in several engagements. [...] Crucially, Marius dropped the requirement for land ownership. This opened the door to tens of thousands of jobless, aimless men to fight for Rome. They were promised adventure and, most importantly, a wage.\n\nHe took his time and trained his legions in his own vision. Some of the Gaius Marius facts we do know is that he devised new tactics for warfare and legion structure and even redesigned weapons. He now had under his command a professional, disciplined army. His reforms have been described as some of the most significant changes the Roman army would ever experience. He even offered his troops retirement benefits."

      "snippet": "Research Starters Home\n\nEBSCO Knowledge Advantage TM\n\n# Gaius Marius Creates a Private Army\n\nGaius Marius, a significant figure in Roman military history, transformed the Roman army from a citizen militia into a professional force during the late second century BCE. This transformation was necessitated by the demands of Rome's expanding empire, which required larger, longer-serving armies. Traditional recruitment methods, reliant on property ownership, became increasingly strained as small landholders struggled to balance farming and military service, particularly with the influx of cheap grain from conquered territories that undermined their livelihoods. [...] Marius’s action, superb in its simplicity, solved once and for all the problems of recruiting military forces. Although the Roman countryside had been depleted of small farmers, the propertyless masses of the city had grown large. From these urban residents and from the large rural population of tenant farmers, Marius forged an army of volunteers who regarded military service not as a civic obligation but as a means of earning a living.\n\n## Significance [...] Marius’s approach was revolutionary; he bypassed the property requirement and recruited volunteers from the urban poor and tenant farmers, who viewed military service as a means of income rather than a civic duty. This shift fundamentally altered the army's allegiance, as soldiers began to identify more with their individual commanders rather than the state itself. Consequently, Marius’s reforms not only addressed immediate recruitment issues but also set the stage for future challenges, including the risks of civil strife and military dictatorship."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the distinguished and inordinately conceited Caecilii Metelli, then at the height of their political power. They backed his candidacy for tribune (defender) of the plebs (common people) in 119. As tribune, Marius proposed a bill affecting procedure in elections and legislative assemblies by narrowing the bridges—the gangway across which each voter passed to fill in and deposit his ballot tablet—as a result of which there was no longer room on the gangway for observers, normally aristocrats, who abused their position to influence an individual’s vote. When the two consuls tried to persuade the Senate to block the bill, Marius threatened them with imprisonment, and the bill was carried."
