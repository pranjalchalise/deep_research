      "snippet": "Dr. Ha Thanh Dong is a dynamic researcher in the field of aquatic animal health, internationally recognized for his contributions to infectious and emerging infectious diseases in tropical aquaculture, disease diagnostics, host-pathogen interactions, and vaccine development. He has played a key role in identifying and developing diagnostic methods for numerous infectious pathogens affecting aquaculture species, including tilapia, Asian sea bass, catfish, snake skin gourami, Siamese fighting fish, and whiteleg shrimp. Dong's research extends to fish immunology and vaccine development, and other new disease-control strategies, offering sustainable alternatives to antibiotics. Recent studies from his team have unveiled unprecedented applications of nanobubble technologies in enhancing the [...] Dong has authored or co-authored over 110 international peer-reviewed articles in this field and currently serves as an advisory board member and/or guest editor for several reputable journals in this field. In 2023, he was listed as one of the world's top 2% most-cited scientists in the field of Fisheries by Stanford University. Additionally, he has served as an expert and/or consultant for several projects led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the WorldFish Center. He is primarily affiliated with the Asian Institute of Technology and has recently been appointed to the honorary title and position of Adjunct Professor at James Cook University, Singapore.   \n  \n Back to home [...] applications of nanobubble technologies in enhancing the efficacy of immersion vaccines in aquaculture, setting the stage for further advancements in this industry."

      "snippet": "Dr. Dong has been actively conducting basic and applied research in the field of aquatic animal health since 2007. His research has centered on the discovery and characterization of aquatic pathogens, particularly infectious and emerging infectious diseases of economically important aquaculture species in Asia. His research group has investigated and developed detection methods for a number of emerging pathogens in tilapia, Asian sea bass, and whiteleg shrimp. He's also working on fish vaccine development and other disease-control strategies, such as nanobubble technology, and immunostimulants. He has authored over 75 international peer-reviewed articles related to this field.\n\nSelected news links: [...] Skip to main content\n\n# Dr Ha Thanh Dong\n\nDr. Dong currently works at the Asian Institute of Technology.

      "snippet": "Defining the mechanisms of immune responses to therapies in patients with advanced cancer. Naturally occurring (endogenous) tumor-reactive immune responses are present and protective, but generally invisible. In most cases with progressive cancers, endogenous tumor-reactive immune cells remain quiescent. Dr. Dong's research group is addressing the therapeutic impacts (immunotherapy, surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) on the patient's own immune system, and seeking a better way to promote and maintain an effective anti-tumor immunity in patients. [...] ### Significance to patient care\n\nEfforts by Dr. Dong and his team are directed toward developing strategies for improving tumor immunotherapy and blunting tumor resistance to cytotoxic therapies, such as immunotherapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. While their research is largely centered on tumors of the kidney, bladder, prostate and breast, as well as on melanoma, the impact of their investigations extends to leukemia and solid malignancies in general.\n\nPROFESSIONAL DETAILS\n\n### Primary Appointment\n\n1.
