      "snippet": "Gaius Marius (Latin: (/wiki/Help:IPA/Latin \"Help:IPA/Latin\"); c. 157 BC – 13 January 86 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times. Rising from a family of smallholders in a village called Ceraetae in the district of Arpinum, Marius acquired his initial military experience serving with Scipio Aemilianus at the Siege of Numantia in 134 BC. He won election as tribune of the plebs in 119 BC and passed a law limiting aristocratic interference in elections. Barely elected praetor in 115 BC, he next became the governor of Further Spain where he campaigned against bandits. [...] Marius was born in Cereatae c. 157 BC, a small village near the town of Arpinum in south-east Latium. The town had been conquered by the Romans in the late 4th century BC and was initially given Roman citizenship without voting rights (civitas sine suffragio). Only in 188 BC, thirty years before his birth, did the town receive full citizenship. Although Plutarch claims that Marius's father was a labourer, this is almost certainly false since Marius had connections with the nobility in Rome, he ran for local office in Arpinum, and he had marriage relations with the local nobility in Arpinum, all of which when taken together indicate that he was born into a locally important family of equestrian \"Equestrian (Roman)\") status. While many of the problems he faced during his early career in [...] In the next campaigning year, Marius is listed as one of the senior legates of the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus \"Publius Rutilius Lupus (consul)\"), who was perhaps one of his relatives. Lupus fell to a Marsic ambush on 11 June 90 BC while crossing the river Tolenus; Marius, commanding a different wing of the army, was yet able to drive the enemy back with heavy losses. The senate, after Lupus' death, appointed Marius in joint command with the praetor Quintus Servilius Caepio \"Quintus Servilius Caepio (quaestor 103 BC)\"); Caepio, however, quickly fell to a Marsic act of perfidy, leaving Marius in sole command. After taking command over the northern front of the war, Marius moved energetically forward, defeating the Marsi with his former legate Sulla's help on hilly ground south of the"

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship"

      "snippet": "## Gaius Marius: Novus Homo\n\ngaius marius portrait vatican\n\nGaius Marius was born in 157 BCE in the Arpinum area of Latinum in Italy. Rome conquered the region in the 4th century BCE, but its people were only granted Roman citizenship in 188 BCE. Marius was one of the first leading men of Arpinium to consider a political career in Rome.\n\nThe biographer Plutarch suggests Marius came from a family of small landholders and that his father was a laborer. This plays into Plutarch’s characterization of Marius as a commoner who built his formidable career with nothing but ambition. However, Marius must have come from local nobility with considerable wealth for his family to have sponsored his political career, and that of his younger brother Marcus Marius, in Rome. [...] Gaius Marius is one of the most compelling personalities of the Roman Republic. Entering politics as a “novus homo” from Italy with few political connections, he proved both his military skill and unbridled ambition during the Jugurthine War. He was subsequently elected consul an incredible seven times as he was seen as the only general capable of dealing with the Cimbrian threat.\n\nServing into his late 50s, Marius initially looked like he would retire as a respected statesman, but fate and ambition involved him in a civil war that left the general dead and Sulla as dictator in Rome. This is the story of Rome’s first strongman, who broke precedents and created a personal army, paving the way for future strongmen, like his nephew Julius Caesar.\n\n## Gaius Marius: Novus Homo [...] gaius marius bust glyptothek\n\nMarius’s military reputation, along with actions such as eating meals alongside the troops and sharing in their labors, won him significant support among the soldiers. He also won support among Italian traders in the area by suggesting he could end the war in a few days with half of Metellus’s troops. Both groups wrote home recommending Marius.\n\nWith his growing support, Marius wanted to run for consul in 108 BCE, but Metellus did not support him or give him leave to return to Rome to contest the election. Nevertheless, Marius was determined, according to Sallust, partly due to a positive prediction from a fortune-teller; the Romans placed great stock in the predictions of soothsayers and astrologers."

      "snippet": "Victorious once again, the Cimbri, Teutons, Ambrones and their Gallic allies decided against invading Italy proper. Instead they searched for more plunder in Gaul and the rich Iberian Peninsula. For Rome, this decision offered them the critical respite they so desperately needed.\n\n## The return of Marius\n\nIn 105 BC, a famous Roman general returned to Italy. His name was Gaius Marius, the victor of the recently-concluded Jugurthine War in north Africa. Marius was very popular with the soldiers – a general with multiple victories behind his back. It was Marius who the Romans looked to in this time of need. [...] ## ‘The Third Founder of Rome’\n\nDespite initially suffering several disastrous defeats, the Romans had recovered and adapted. But in the end their foe’s decision to plunder Spain and not march on Italy after their great victory at Arausio was key, allowing Marius the time to muster and train his new, model army. As for Marius, he was hailed as the saviour of Rome; no less than “the third founder of Rome,” reports Plutarch, “as having diverted a danger no less threatening than was that when the Gauls sacked Rome.”\n\nMarius would go on to take consulship 7 times – an unprecedented number. Backed by his army he became the first of the great warlords that epitomised the late Republican period and dominated the Roman political scene. Yet his victory against the Cimbri was his finest hour.\n\n[]( [...] Battle of Aquae Sextiae\n\nThe last stand and suicide of the Teuton women and their children at Aquae Sextiae.\n\nFresh from victory, Marius and his legions returned to northern Italy. The Cimbri, in the meantime, invaded from the north. On 30 July 101 BC the final battle occurred at Vercellae. Once again Marius and his new army won a decisive victory. The Cimbri were massacred. As the Romans stormed the Cimbri camp, the tribes’ women resisted their foe in a last stand. Almost all the Cimbri tribesmen were slaughtered – their women and children sent into a life of slavery. The Germanic threat was no more.\n\n## ‘The Third Founder of Rome’"
