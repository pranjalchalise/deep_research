I’m a junior majoring in Neuroscience with a growing interest in computer science. My time at Amherst has been all about exploration. Whether it’s playing the saxophone, dabbling in darkroom photography, or even experimenting with metalwork, I love discovering new passions. Outside of class, I work with a nonprofit, A Better Chance (ABC), that supports Amherst High School students as they navigate the college application process. I’m deeply motivated to give back because of the incredible network of support that has helped me along my own journey.  As a Peer Academic Coach, I believe in holistic reflection—both in and outside of the classroom—and I’m committed to providing helpful insights, resourceful tools, or simply being an open and supportive listener.
