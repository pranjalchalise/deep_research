He worked in restaurants to pay his college tuition and in 1967 was hired as the manager of a new place in Lakeland, Florida, called Red Lobster. He hit it off with founder Bill Darden and became part of the concept’s ownership group. [...] When General Mills decided to spin off its restaurants in 1995, Lee was tapped as CEO of the new company. At his suggestion, it was named Darden Restaurants after his Red Lobster co-founder, who had died a year earlier. \n\nLee led Darden until 2004, and under his guidance, it became one of the largest and most well-respected companies in the restaurant industry. Today, Orlando-based Darden has more than 2,100 restaurants across 10 full-service brands, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen. [...] His impact on the restaurant business ran deep, and the news of his death led to an outpouring of remembrances Monday. In a LinkedIn post, Kim Lopdrup, the former Red Lobster CEO and Darden executive, called Lee a “giant.”\n\n“He did more than anyone to make Red Lobster and Darden Restaurants successful,” Lopdrup wrote. “He is still loved and revered by long-term employees at both companies.”\n\nDarden CEO Rick Cardenas said the company was saddened by Lee’s passing."
