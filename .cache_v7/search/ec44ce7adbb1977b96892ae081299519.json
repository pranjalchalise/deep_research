      "snippet": "While these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of artificial intelligence products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\n\n## How does LangChain work?\n\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps. [...] LangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response. [...] LangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\n### Importing language models"

      "snippet": "You could also spin up a vector database (special database just for Embeddings which are a numerical way of representing the meaning of text) but this often takes a bit of work. Langchain has a memory module which provides plug and play access to multiple data store which allow you to save the message history of a conversation automatically further reducing the friction to create a chatbot for example. [...] Langchain makes creating agents using large language models simple through their agents API. Developers can use OpenAI functions or other means of executing tasks to enable to language model to take actions. [...] ### Why does langchain exist? 🤔\n\nSimply put, there are many rough edges to working with languages models today. The entire ecosystem is still developing so for developers, there is generally a lack of sufficient tooling to make production deployments of languages models.\n\nTasks like prompt chaining, logging, call backs, persistent memory, and efficient connections to multiple data sources come standard out of the box with langchain.\n\nLangchain also provides a model agnostic toolset that enables companies and developers to explore multiple LLM offerings and test what works best for their use cases. The best part is that you can do this in a single interface instead of having to linearly scale the size of a code base which each additional provider you try to support."
