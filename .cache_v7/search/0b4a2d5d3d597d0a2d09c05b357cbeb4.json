Mick Jagger\n\nBefore he began strutting his stuff on stage, Sir Michael Phillip \"Mick\" Jagger, lead singer of The Rolling Stones, worked as a porter at the Bexley Mental Hospital while he was a student at the London School of Economics. He earned a whopping 4 pounds, 10 shillings per week (about $7.80 U.S.). Perhaps Jagger's gig at the hospital inspired a couple of the Stones' early hits, such as \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" and \"Mother's Little Helper.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 2.

Ozzy Osbourne\n\nSinger Ozzy Osbourne, born John Michael Osbourne, is the lead singer of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, a popular solo artist, and a reality TV star with his wife Sharon and two children, Kelly and Jack. Growing up in England, Osbourne was once a laborer in a slaughterhouse. This may have influenced some of his famous stunts, like biting off the head of a live dove during a meeting with his newly signed record company and biting the head off a bat thrown on stage during a concert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 9. Sean Connery [...] .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 5. Dennis Farina\n\nItalian-American actor Dennis Farina often portrays cops, detectives, or mobsters and is best known for his roles in Law & Order, Crime Story, and Get Shorty. Some may think he's being typecast, but it's no wonder that Farina is so comfortable in his roles -- from 1967 to 1985, he actually was a police officer with the Chicago Police Department. Farina caught the acting bug after working with director Michael Mann as a police consultant. He started out in community theater and with bit parts on television before landing a starring role in Crime Story in 1986.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 6. Clint Eastwood"
