[...] 7 Conclusion In this study, we introduced WelQrate, a new gold standard for benchmarking in small molecule drug discovery. Our contributions include rigorous data curation, a standardized evaluation framework, and extensive benchmarking of existing deep learning architectures. Through expert-designed curation pipelines, WelQrate dataset collection addresses prevalent issues, such as inconsistent chemical representations and noisy experimental data, ensuring high-quality labeling of active molecules crucial for reliable model training and evaluation. Our proposed evaluation framework encompasses critical aspects such as featurization, 3D structure generation, relevant evaluation metrics, etc., providing a reliable basis for model comparison and facilitating accurate and realistic"
