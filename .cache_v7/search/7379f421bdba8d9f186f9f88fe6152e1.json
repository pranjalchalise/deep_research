When speaking, people usually stand closer to one another with little regard for privacy. Information and feelings may be expressed by nonverbal means, such as body language, gestures, eye contact, or tone of voice. Verbal communication tends to be indirect, with a person's context more meaningful than the actual words. For example, if someone says he is hungry, that may be a cue that he would like someone to prepare food for him. The sensitive nature of such cultures means people are more attuned to disagreements. Personal offenses are taken seriously and must be resolved or avoided to ensure harmony within the group. [...] of community and government leaders establishing the rules and responsibilities for the group. [...] Tradition is an essential element in high-context societies and change is slow to occur. Communities tend to be close-knit and long-lasting, having occupied the same geographical areas for several generations. Time is thought of as a more casual concept. Day-to-day life moves along at its own pace, without the need of time constraints. Individual or group considerations often take precedence over the need to conform to a strict schedule. As a result, it is not as important when something gets done but rather that it eventually gets accomplished."
