For an introduction to React, please visit the Learn section.\n\nThe React reference documentation is broken down into functional subsections:\n\n## React\n\nProgrammatic React features:\n\n Hooks - Use different React features from your components.\n Components - Built-in components that you can use in your JSX.\n APIs - APIs that are useful for defining components.\n Directives - Provide instructions to bundlers compatible with React Server Components.\n\n## React DOM\n\nReact DOM contains features that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). This section is broken into the following: [...] Configuration - Configuration options for React Compiler.\n Directives - Function-level directives to control compilation.\n Compiling Libraries - Guide for shipping pre-compiled library code.\n\n## ESLint Plugin React Hooks\n\nThe ESLint plugin for React Hooks helps enforce the Rules of React:\n\n Lints - Detailed documentation for each lint with examples.\n\n## Rules of React\n\nReact has idioms — or rules — for how to express patterns in a way that is easy to understand and yields high-quality applications: [...] Components and Hooks must be pure – Purity makes your code easier to understand, debug, and allows React to automatically optimize your components and hooks correctly.\n React calls Components and Hooks – React is responsible for rendering components and hooks when necessary to optimize the user experience.\n Rules of Hooks – Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called.\n\n## Legacy APIs\n\n Legacy APIs - Exported from the `react` package, but not recommended for use in newly written code.\n\nNextHooks\n\n---"

      "snippet": "Learn React\n\n# Quick Start\n\nWelcome to the React documentation! This page will give you an introduction to 80% of the React concepts that you will use on a daily basis.\n\n### You will learn\n\n How to create and nest components\n How to add markup and styles\n How to display data\n How to render conditions and lists\n How to respond to events and update the screen\n How to share data between components\n\n## Creating and nesting components\n\nReact apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.\n\nReact components are JavaScript functions that return markup:\n\n```\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n\nreturn (\n\n<button>I'm a buttonbutton>\n\n);\n\n}\n\n``` [...] ## Using Hooks\n\nFunctions starting with `use` are called Hooks. `useState` is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the API reference. You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.\n\nHooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use `useState` in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.\n\n## Sharing data between components\n\nIn the previous example, each `MyButton` had its own independent `count`, and when each button was clicked, only the `count` for the button clicked changed:\n\nHowever, often you’ll need components to share data and always update together. [...] To make both `MyButton` components display the same `count` and update together, you need to move the state from the individual buttons “upwards” to the closest component containing all of them.\n\nIn this example, it is `MyApp`:\n\nNow when you click either button, the `count` in `MyApp` will change, which will change both of the counts in `MyButton`. Here’s how you can express this in code.\n\nFirst, move the state up from `MyButton` into `MyApp`:\n\n```\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\nsetCount(count + 1);\n\n}\n\nreturn (\n\n<div>\n\n<h1>Counters that update separatelyh1>\n\n<MyButton />\n\n<MyButton />\n\ndiv>\n\n);\n\n}\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n\n// ... we're moving code from here ...\n\n}\n\n```"

React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications. [...] ### Application structure\n\nVite gives us everything we need to develop a React application. Its initial file structure looks like this:\n\n```\nmoz-todo-react ├── README.md ├── index.html ├── node_modules ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json ├── public │ └── vite.svg ├── src │ ├── App.css │ ├── App.jsx │ ├── assets │ │ └── react.svg │ ├── index.css │ └── main.jsx └── vite.config.js \n```\n\n`index.html` is the most important top-level file. Vite injects your code into this file so that your browser can run it. You won't need to edit this file during our tutorial, but you should change the text inside the  element in this file to reflect the title of your application. Accurate page titles are important for accessibility. [...] > ); } \n```\n\nThe `App()` function returns a JSX expression. This expression defines what your browser ultimately renders to the DOM.\n\nJust under the `return` keyword is a special bit of syntax: `<>`. This is a fragment. React components have to return a single JSX element, and fragments allow us to do that without rendering arbitrary `s in the browser. You'll see fragments in many React applications.\n\n### The export statement\n\nThere's one more line of code after the App() function:\n\njsx\n\n```\nexport default App; \n```\n\nThis export statement makes our App() function available to other modules. We'll talk more about this later.\n\n## Moving on to main"

In React 19, we’ve added support for properties that works on the client and during SSR with the following strategy: [...] `// Before Actionsfunction UpdateName({}) {  const [name, setName] = useState(\"\");  const [error, setError] = useState(null);  const [isPending, setIsPending] = useState(false);  const handleSubmit = async () => {    setIsPending(true);    const error = await updateName(name);    setIsPending(false);    if (error) {      setError(error);      return;    }     redirect(\"/path\");  };  return (    <div>      <input value={name} onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)} />      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>        Update      </button>      {error && <p>{error}</p>}    </div>  );}`\n\nIn React 19, we’re adding support for using async functions in transitions to handle pending states, errors, forms, and optimistic updates automatically."
