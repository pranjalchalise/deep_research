      "snippet": "If Monty Python took anything seriously, it was breaking the rules of comedy. Across the great variety of work it has produced over the decades, the six-member comedy troupe has rarely shied away from big risks in style and format to popularize its surreal, unpredictable brand of humor, which often veiled a witty intellectual undercurrent. It first entered British television screens with Monty Python’s Flying Circus in 1969 and later garnered an ardent following in the United States, where the group’s popularity was further bolstered by the success of its films, especially Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) and Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979). The troupe also produced a host of other works, including live shows, books, and music albums. [...] The Pythons, with the exception of Gilliam, found their start in the university revues at Oxford and Cambridge and thereafter graduated to writing and performing in television shows, occasionally crossing paths. Most notably, the five Pythons were part of the writing team on the satirical British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) comedy show The Frost Report (1967). Among other projects, Chapman and Cleese wrote and appeared in At Last the 1948 Show (1967), in which they experimented with the rules of comedy. Meanwhile, Idle, Jones, and Palin took on writing and acting duties for the children’s program Do Not Adjust Your Set (1967–69), on which Gilliam was hired as an animator on the back of a referral from Cleese. Encouraged by comedian and producer Barry Took, the two sets of comedians [...] ### What are some of Monty Python’s most famous films?\n\nThe group’s most popular films include Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979), and Monty Python’s the Meaning of Life (1983).\n\n### Why is Monty Python sometimes called “the Beatles of comedy”?\n\nMonty Python’s outsized and lasting influence on comedy has led some fans to dub the group “the Beatles of comedy.” The comedy troupe influenced such shows as Saturday Night Live, The Simpsons, and South Park and comedians such as Rowan Atkinson and Steve Martin."

      "snippet": "First up, it’s the British/American wits that are frequently named the greatest comedy group in history. On this day in 1969, according to one version of the story, British comedians John Cleese and Graham Chapman went to a tandoori restaurant in Northern London following the taping of comedy show ‘Do Not Adjust Your Set’ by Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and featuring the animation of final Python member and American injection Terry Gilliam.\n\nThe sixsome formed Monty Python and began running the incredibly successful sketch show ‘Monty Python's Flying Circus’, followed by four films including 1975’s Monty Python and the Holy Grail, 1979’s controversial Monty Python’s Life of Brian and 1983’s Monty Python’s Meaning of Life. [...] If you’ve not seen any of these, or the films and TV shows that they’ve made individually, you’re missing out on some of the most surreal and wacky pieces of humour ever made. For most Brits, Monty Python is their introduction to humour, cutting a perfect sarcastic tone with ridiculous imagery, linguistic bravado, and untold silliness.\n\nFor a taster, here’s my favourite Monty Python sketch. Taken from their first film 1971’s And Now for Something Completely Different, the self-defence class sketch has Cleese as an militant teacher, providing a masterclass in how to defend yourself against an attacker armed with… different varieties of fruit.\n\nGoodbye to an associate Python [...] Goodbye to an associate Python\n\nBesides the six members, only two other people were ever credited with writing for ‘Monty Python's Flying Circus’. The first was Neil Innes and the second was Douglas Adams. Taking the place of Cleese for the show’s final series, Adams wrote a sketch and had two cameo experiences.\n\nOver a decade younger than most of the Pythons, Adams went on to great success with his legendary radio and book series ‘The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’. His trilogy of five books followed the hapless Arthur Dent on his explorations of the universe after Earth was destroyed. Bringing together the same silliness and literary wit of the Python universe to a galactic setting, he became a national darling."

Monty Python's Flying Circus [...] The Pythons built on and extended the great British tradition of cross-dressing comedy. Rather than dressing a man as a woman purely for comic effect, the (entirely male) Python team would write humourous parts for women, then don frocks and makeup and play the roles themselves. Thus a scene requiring a housewife would feature one of the male Pythons wearing a housecoat and apron, speaking in falsetto. While this accentuated the humour, it was not, in itself, the joke (had a woman played the role, the lines would have had the same comic effect). Generally speaking, female roles were only played by a real woman (usually Carol Cleveland) when the scene specifically required that the character be sexually attractive. In some episodes and the later Monty Python's Life of Brian they took the [...] make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that \"This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in\" - they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set). However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, Spike Milligan, recording his new series Q5 (1969). Not only was the programme more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy, Milligan would often \"give up\" on sketches halfway through and wander off set (often muttering \"did I write this?\"). It was clear that their new series would now seem somewhat less original, and Jones in particular became determined the Pythons should innovate further."

And you needed those people, just in the same way that with the Beatles you had four talented people, but together you had the Beatles. And I think that's so incredibly true when it comes to Python.\"(\n\n### Comedy stylists\n\n[edit]\n\n> \"Everything I've ever done can be distilled to at least one Python sketch. If comedy had a periodic element table, Python would have more than one atom on it.\"\n\n—Mike Myers.( [...] By contrast, according to John Cleese's autobiography, the origins of _Monty Python_ lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on _Do Not Adjust Your Set_; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship.( According to their official website, the group was born from a Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead on 11 May 1969, following a taping of _Do Not Adjust Your Set_ which Cleese and Chapman attended.( It was the first time all six got together, with their first meetings then taking place at Cleese's apartment in Basil Street, Knightsbridge in central London.("

      "snippet": "European Vacation and Wind and the Willows.  Idle was enrolled in Royal Wolverhampton boarding school at the age of seven.  Growing up in this environment, Idle developed the wit and intelligence that would win him a place at Cambridge, where he met his fellow Pythons.  Back to top   Terry Jones Terry Jones is a British comedian, writer and director whose goofy sketches and wild imagination made him an invaluable member of the Monty Python troupe.  As an actor on “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” Jones was the Python most often chosen to portray roles as middle-aged women — but as a writer and director his true charms shone through.  Jones’ directorial skills can be seen in all three of the Python feature length films, co-directing Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and directing Life of [...] children’s programming ever since.  Gilliam graduated from Occidental College in Los Angeles before moving to England, where he was an animator for “Do Not Adjust Your Set” before joining “Monty Python’s Flying Circus.”  Back to top   Eric Idle Eric Idle is a comedian, actor, director and songwriter, but Idle is best known as one of the zany and legendary members of the Monty Python troupe.  Idle most recently wrote the book and lyrics for the Tony Award-winning Spamalot, based on the Monty Python classic, Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Idle prefers to write alone, unlike the other members of Monty Python, who tend to work in comedic teams.  His solo talents have provided some of the classic Python skits, such as “Nudge Nudge Wink Wink.”  Idle also composed the majority of the songs [...] the Daily Telegraph and the Observer.  Back to top   Michael Palin Michael Palin is a British comedian and television presenter who is most recognized for being one of the members of the Monty Python troupe. In a 2005 poll, The Comedian’s Comedian, Palin was voted one of the world’s Top 50 comedians of all time.  As a member of Monty Python, Palin wrote and acted in many of the legendary skits and is credited for creating some of its most memorable sketches. One of his original sketches, Spanish Inquisition, has become a part of popular culture in the form of a widely used catchphrase, “Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.”  In addition to acting in “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and the many Python feature length films, Palin was the stuttering “Ken Pile” in the 1988 hit, A Fish"
