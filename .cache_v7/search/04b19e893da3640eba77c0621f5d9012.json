      "snippet": "In addition, through the Cyber Security Cooperation Program (CSCP), Public Safety Canada (PS) will provide grants and contributions to a range of initiatives aimed to reduce cybercrime against Canadians, strengthen Canada's ability to protect its critical infrastructure, increase Canadians' cyber security awareness, augment Canadians' cyber security skills, and improve Canada's competitiveness in the global economy.\n\nThe Government of Canada will continue to increase Canada's cyber workforce through programs like Express Entry, which allows skilled foreign workers to come to Canada and work in their fields of expertise. [...] The \"Get Cyber Safe\" program provides Canadians with free access to basic cyber hygiene tips and education. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC), the Competition Bureau, and the Canada Revenue Agency coordinate fraud awareness efforts.\n\nThe Government of Canada will strive to make cyber security more accessible to all Canadians. Enhancing collective cyber hygiene and awareness ensures the safety and security of more Canadians, and it reduces the risk of Canadians becoming victims of cybercrime. Cyber security considerations need to become embedded in the day-to-day operations of Canadian businesses and in Canadian innovation, particularly in sectors of national importance such as health, energy, and green technology. [...] ### Objective 2.2: Grow the Foundational Workforce of the Future\n\n#### Cyber security talent development, attraction, retention, and education are critical to our national success.\n\nAlready, the Upskilling for Industry Initiative allows employers to identify skill requirements in rapidly growing sectors. By encouraging collaboration between employers and training providers, the program helps deliver tailored upskilling programs that meet employers' needs, particularly in high-growth industries. The initiative is anticipated to help over 15,000 Canadians, including individuals from underrepresented backgrounds, access new employment opportunities."
