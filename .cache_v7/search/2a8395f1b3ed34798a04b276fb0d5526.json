      "snippet": "## Activism\n\nWhile working at the Income Tax Department in Delhi, Kejriwal was frustrated by the way his department functioned. In 1999, using donations from family members, he started the organization Parivartan (Hindi: “Change”), which worked to address citizens’ grievances related to public works, food rations, income tax, and electricity. Parivartan identified several misappropriations of funds in public works projects by using the Right to Information Act, which allows citizens to access government records. [...] Kejriwal worked at Tata Steel in Jamshedpur from 1989 to 1992 before resigning to prepare for the Civil Services Examination in order to enter into government service work. He met Mother Teresa in Calcutta (Kolkata) during this break and performed volunteer work with the Missionaries of Charity for two months. Kejriwal took the Civil Services Examination and began working at the IRS in 1995. He met his future wife, Sunita Agarwal, a fellow IRS officer, during training at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy of Administration in Mussoorie.\n\n## Activism [...] In 2006 he was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership—a recognition for social transformation and leadership in Asia—for his work with Parivartan. He resigned from the IRS the same year to become a full-time activist and donated his Magsaysay award money to found the Public Cause Research Foundation, a nongovernmental organization. In 2012 he published a book entitled Swaraj (“Self-governance”), in which he describes his views on corruption and Indian democracy."

      "snippet": "In 2006, Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his involvement in the Parivartan movement using right to information legislation in a campaign against government corruption. The same year, after resigning from government service, he founded the Public Cause Research Foundation to campaign for transparent governance. Before entering politics, Kejriwal had worked in the Indian Revenue Service. Prior to that, he was a mechanical engineer from IIT Kharagpur. [...] In 2001, the Delhi government enacted a state-level Right To Information (RTI) Act, which allowed the citizens to access government records for a small fee. Parivartan used RTI to help people get their work done in government departments without paying a bribe. In 2002, the group obtained official reports on 68 public works projects in the area, and performed a community-led audit to expose misappropriations worth ₹ 7 million in 64 of the projects. On 14 December 2002, Parivartan organised a Jan sunvai (public hearing), in which the citizens held public officials and leaders accountable for the lack of development in their locality.

      "title": "How Arvind Kejriwal, the architect of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption ...",
      "snippet": "For two years, Kejriwal travelled to villages across north India to mobilise support for an RTI law. Drawing on his own experiences, he told people that government officials deliberately engineered delays to force the payment of bribes, and argued that a strong RTI law would expose corrupt practices.\n\nIn 2004, Kejriwal launched an experimental project in one East Delhi neighbourhood, Nand Nagri, to test ways to hold government officials accountable. Kejriwal formed a committee consisting of 10 local residents who were trained to scrutinise the activities of the member of the legislative assembly (MLA) from their constituency. The committee then demanded public consultations over everything from road paving to drainage repair. [...] Rakesh Senger, a child rights activist who worked with Kejriwal in Nand Nagri, said the goal of the project was to “give people some sense of power right from the mohalla level.” In the end, however, a rift formed among the committee members, dissolving the project, but its means and ends offer a neat summation of Kejriwal’s activism. “We wanted to create a situation,” Senger told me, “that would make government officers feel people are watching them.” [...] Kejriwal works out of an apartment-sized office in East Delhi, a 10-minute walk from the Kaushambi metro station in Ghaziabad. His staff consists of a few paid employees and a rotating cast of volunteers, who are usually wearing India Against Corruption T-shirts and working purposefully at about half a dozen outdated computers. It feels a bit like an old government office, with basic furniture, dim lighting, tall stacks of pamphlets and newspapers and framed pictures of Anna Hazare and Mahatma Gandhi decorating the walls; retired bureaucrats and journalists drop by during the day to share their suggestions with Kejriwal or his closest associate, Manish Sisodia."

      "snippet": "While at IIT, he joined the drama society and formed lifelong friendships, as his classmate Pran Kurup recalls: “Arvind and I first bonded during ragging; seniors made him act as Gabbar Singh, and I played Helen.”\n\nAfter graduating in 1989, Kejriwal worked at Tata Steel but left in 1992 to prepare for the civil services. During this time, he briefly served at the Ramakrishna Mission and met Mother Teresa in Kolkata.\n\nKejriwal (smiling in a gray shirt, positioned behind the young man in a brown T-shirt) celebrating Holi with friends at IIT Kharagpur. [...] A passion for social service In 1993, Kejriwal joined the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) as a Joint Income Tax Officer. Yet, bureaucracy didn’t satisfy him. By December 1999, he founded the NGO ‘Parivartan,’ focusing on RTI activism and government accountability.\n\nIn 2006, his work earned him the Ramon Magsaysay Award.\n\nPran Kurup recalls visiting Kejriwal in Delhi’s Sundar Nagari slums: “He was living among the poor to understand their problems firsthand. I couldn’t believe my IRS friend was staying in a hut.” His advocacy through RTIs, like helping a man secure an electricity connection despite bureaucratic hurdles, cemented his reputation as a people’s champion.\n\nMeeting Sunita and marriage Kejriwal met Sunita during IRS training at Nagpur’s National Academy of Direct Taxes. [...] Yogendra Yadav (2015): Disagreed with Kejriwal’s centralization of power.\n Prashant Bhushan (2015): Criticized the lack of internal democracy.\n Kumar Vishwas (2018): Publicly clashed with Kejriwal before being ousted.\n\nThe legacy of a relentless reformer From filing RTIs to revolutionizing Delhi’s politics, Arvind Kejriwal’s journey reflects his determination to challenge the status quo. Despite controversies and setbacks, his grassroots connection and innovative governance continue to inspire supporters and critics alike.\n\n.\n\nMore news...\n\n ### Opinion Ruchir Sharma's Column: With ruling parties returning to power there, voters in developing countries, including India, are not angry\n\n  Originals\n\n  + Copy link"
