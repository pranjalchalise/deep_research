      "snippet": "SEE YOU IN THE FUNNY PAPERS\n\nPerhaps the sweetest, and funniest, reference to Lee in recent pop culture comes from Berkeley Breathed, creator of the “Bloom County” and “Outland” comic strips. In one installment of “Outland” from 1994, Opus the Penguin reflects on “To Kill a Mockingbird,” his favorite book.\n\n“Every summer since I was little, I’ve re-read it,” Opus reflects, “just to remind me [of] ‘the fragile thread of dignity and grace that unites the human tapestry.’ ” Opus is then told that a sequel to the movie version of “To Kill a Mockingbird” is in the works, and is handed the script.\n\nThe sequel is not “Go Set a Watchman,” though. It’s a movie called “Kill Mo’ Mockingbird: Boo Radley Loose in the Hood,” written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Oliver Stone. [...] MUSIC\n\nPerhaps the most overt reference to Lee’s novel in rock music comes from the Boo Radleys, a ‘90s Britpop band that took their name from the reclusive, misunderstood hero in “To Kill a Mockingbird.” The band was best known for its insanely catchy song “Wake Up Boo!”, and the guitarist explained the group’s name in an interview on the Creation Records website: “We just thought it was a cool name. ... It was the one book we did in school that had any lasting impression on me.” [...] Here are some of our favorites.\n\nTELEVISION\n\nOne of the earliest references to Lee’s book on American television came in 1969, with an episode of the comedy “Get Smart” featuring the agents on the trail of a figurine called the “Tequila Mockingbird.”\n\n(“Tequila Mockingbird” is the joke that refuses to die. There’s a cocktail with that name, featuring lime juice, creme de menthe and tequila; an entire book of literary cocktails; the Los Angeles punk scenester; drag performers; and bars and restaurants in Maryland, Connecticut, Florida and New Zealand named after the groan-worthy pun.)"

      "snippet": "Lee Jun-fan (Chinese: 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973), known professionally as Bruce Lee (Chinese: 李小龍), was a Hong Kong-American actor, director, martial artist, martial arts instructor, and philosopher. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA). Lee is considered by commentators, critics, media, and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. [...] for Lee. In Cadwell's account, \"The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'Do you give up?' and the man said he gave up\". A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him. In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation, and there were no further public announcements by either, though Lee continued to teach white people. Lee had [...] Lee is best known as a martial artist, but he also studied drama and Asian and Western philosophy while a student at the University of Washington and throughout his life. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts. His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts. His influences include Taoism, Jiddu Krishnamurti, and Buddhism.

      "snippet": "Even more than marketing you could write an entire PhD dissertation on the influence of Bruce Lee in modern cinema and that would just be the obvious references. You could argue that the only Kung Fu films not influenced in some way would be those filmed prior to Fist of Fury, I would not argue, but lets look at the more obvious instances of influence.\n\n“The Last Dragon” a Barry Gordy film from the 1980’s that portrayed the young “Bruce” Leroy Green who is pushed to fight for the safety of his family, more than just the character’s name the entire film is an homage to Bruce from the outfits, to the dialogue to the moral. Some critics shun the movie as 80’s teen cinema, but I find few films with the staying power of “the Last Dragon.” [...] You could look for more obscure films such as “No Retreat, No Surrender” which finds a young bullied martial arts fan running from the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damme until the Ghost of Lee comes from his poster to train and inspire the hero to save not only himself but the entire City of Seattle (Bruce’s American Hometown) from mobsters. [...] When you consider Bruce Lee in music look no further than hip-hop and his name and image are used almost as frequently as an analogy and one of hip hops biggest names the Wu Tang Clan created there entire style after the Eastern Culture of martial arts.\n\nNo place on Earth is out of the reach of Lee’s Legacy, the most famous face of the NBA today Kobe Bryant is a die-hard Bruce fanatic, so much so that his latest line of sneakers was heavily inspired by a combination of Enter the Dragon and Game of Death colorways and the tiger claw scratch."

      "snippet": "Lee's own appearance as Frankenstein's monster led to his first appearance as the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula in the film Dracula \"Dracula (1958 film)\") (1958, known as Horror of Dracula in the US). The film saw Lee's \"triumphant debut\" fix the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture, according to the writer Kevin Jackson \"Kevin Jackson (writer)\"). Dracula has been ranked among the best British films. Lee introduced a dark, brooding sexuality to the character, with Tim Stanley stating, \"Lee's sensuality was subversive in that it hinted that women might quite like having their neck chewed on by a stud.\" The film magazine Empire ranked Lee's portrayal as Dracula the 7th Greatest Horror Movie Character of All Time. CNN listed the performance third in their top 10 British [...] The Carandinis, Lee's maternal ancestors, were given the right to bear the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. In the late 1950s, Lee was engaged to Countess Henriette Ewa Agnes von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm. Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London-based friends to interview Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Boulting, and Joe Jackson \"Joe Jackson (barrister)\"). Lee found the meeting of her extended family to be like something from a surrealist Luis Buñuel film, and thought they were \"killing me with cream.\" Finally, Lee had to have the [...] [edit]\n\nSee also: Christopher Lee filmography\n\nLee was the subject of the BBC's This Is Your Life \"This Is Your Life (British TV series)\") in 1974, where he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. In 1994, for his influence on the horror genre, he received the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 1997, he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John \"Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)\"). On 16 June 2001, as part of that year's Queen's Birthday Honours, Lee was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire \"for services to Drama.\" He was made a Knight Bachelor \"For services to Drama and to Charity\" on 13 June as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2009. The French government made him a Commander of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2011."

      "snippet": "Music is deployed much more sparingly in Sittenfeld’s Prep. The narrator, Lee, is a fourteen-year-old girl trying to navigate her way through the social hierarchies and complicated relationships of an elite prep school in the 1980s. Lee is not overly interested in music, and when she wears her dad’s old T-shirt with the words “The Times They Are a-Changin,'” she isn’t even aware of the reference until a classmate, Conchita, asks her if she’s a Bob Dylan fan. Conchita ends up inviting Lee back to her dorm room to play her a few songs. Conchita’s love for Dylan gives the reader some quick insight into her character—independent and freethinking—but Sittenfeld also uses the scene to say something about her narrator. Lee is not all that taken with most of the music, except for one particular [...] By simply employing this one song, Sittenfeld builds a bridge between the narrator and reader, and gives us a gateway into the longing and melancholy Lee experiences throughout the course of the narrative.\n\nDarcey Steinke, Sister Golden Hair\n\nDarcey Steinke, Sister Golden Hair [...] Now, my fiction still tends to make pop music references. Lots of them. I’m not sure how many there are in my novel, Another Life, but catching all of them would probably make a decent drinking game. Over the years, though, I’ve learned to only use music when it will serve the story and the characters.\n\nHere are 6 novels that reference pop music in interesting, effective ways.\n\nNick Hornby, High Fidelity\n\nNick Hornby, High Fidelity"
