After his praetor­ship, however, the province of Farther Spain was allotted to him, and here he is said to have cleared away the robbers, although the province was still uncivilized in its customs and in a savage state, and robbery was at that time still considered a most honourable occupation by the Spaniards. But when he returned to political life, he had neither wealth nor eloquence, with which the magnates of the time used to influence the people. 2 Still, the very intensity of his assurance, his indefatigable labours, and his plain and simple way of living, won him a certain popularity among his fellow citizens, and his honours brought him increasing influence, so that he married into the illustrious family [...] 31 1 When a decree was introduced recalling Metellus from exile, Marius opposed it strongly both by word and deed, but finding his efforts vain, at last desisted; and after the people had adopted the measure with alacrity, unable to endure the sight of Metellus returning, he set sail for Cappadocia and Galatia,⁠33 ostensibly to make the sacrifices which he p551had vowed to the Mother of the Gods, but really having another reason for his journey which the people did not suspect. 2 He had, that is, no natural aptitude for peace or civil life, but had reached his eminence by arms. And now, thinking that his influence and reputation were gradually fading away because of his inactivity and quietude, he sought occasions for new enterprises. For he hoped that if he stirred up the kings of Asia"

      "snippet": "During the next decade the influence of his rival Sulla grew. When the\nSocial War finally broke out\nin Italy, between Rome and some of her rival cities, Sulla took a leadership role, while Marius\nserved only for a single campaign. He was sixty six years old, and his health was starting to fail.\nThe following year however, when Sulla was appointed to lead an army against\nMithradates, his\njealousy overcame his better judgment, and Marius induced his allies in the senate to recall Sulla\nand give the command to him. Sulla would not stand for this and marched back to Rome with his army,\nsending Marius into exile. The exile of Marius was a dramatic episode, as he was chased all over\nItaly and eventually to Carthage, with Sulla's forces in hot pursuit. [...] Once the Gauls were subdued there was no need for Marius to continue to be elected consul, but he\ndisliked giving up his influence. He was not possessed with great oratorical powers or\nstatesmanlike gifts, and in order be elected for the sixth time, he used treachery to drive his\nrival Metellus out of town. He allied himself with populist demagogues, and generally made himself\nhated by many of the patricians. Since it was impossible to be re-elected a seventh time he retired\nto Asia, hoping to stir up a war that would again put him back in power. [...] Marius\n\nMarius spent two years in Africa tending to local administration before returning to Rome. He won\nhis second consulship in 104 B.C., and shortly afterward achieved great renown\nfor defeating the Teutone and Cimbri invaders in northern Italy.\nThese victories brought him great\npopularity with both the people of Rome, and the army, and he was elected consul five years in\nsuccession, from 104 to 100 B.C., an unprecedented run. During this period he\nreorganized the army, an achievement that laid the ground work for the Roman legions of imperial\ndays. Under Marius, Rome established for the first time a standing army, manned by professional\nsoldiers. During this period Marius achieved great things for Rome, enjoyed immense popularity, and\nwas called the \"Third Founder of Rome.\""

      "snippet": "Like Gaius Gracchus, who died two years earlier, Gaius Marius was elected Tribune of the Plebs in 119 BC. Marius’ legislative efforts aimed at reducing the influence of the wealthy elite in Roman politics and promoting the rights of the lower classes, making him a popular figure among the common people.\n\nHis first piece of legislation was to ban interference from the wealthy in the election process and this lost him much support among the aristocracy.\n\nDuring the next five years in the life of Gaius Marius, facts are a little hard to come by. He may have been elected praetor in 116 BC but, two years later, he was appointed governor of Hispania Ulterior – or Further Spain – the south of Spain and parts of Portugal. [...] It has also been suggested that by ensuring the loyalty of the army rested with their commanding officers rather than the Republic itself – unprecedented in the history of Rome – Consul Marius hastened the transformation into an empire.\n\nUnrivalled in the theatre of war, Gaius Marius – sometimes spelled Caius Marius – met his match in the political arena which led to his eventual downfall.\n\nRead on to discover the fascinating Gaius Marius biography.\n\n### The Early Life of Gaius Marius\n\nGaius Marius (Photo: Universal History Archive via Getty Images)\n\nGaius Marius was born around 157 BC in a small village near the town of Arpinum, around 100 km southeast of Rome, the same town where Cicero was born. [...] Although his specific actions during the conflict are not well-documented, Marius’ experience and military prowess likely contributed to the eventual Roman victory. By the end of the war, Rome agreed to grant citizenship to its Italian allies, but the conflict had further deepened the divisions within the Roman political landscape, setting the stage for the power struggles that would mark Marius’ final years.\n\n### Later Years\n\nLucius Cornelius Sulla (Photo: Print Collector via Getty Images)\n\nThe final years of Gaius Marius were marked by political turmoil and personal struggles. Following his military successes, Marius returned to Rome as a celebrated hero."

      "snippet": "### Standing for the consulship\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 108 BC, Marius expressed his desire to stand for consul. Metellus did not give Marius his blessing to return to Rome, allegedly advising Marius to wait until Metellus's son was elected (who was at the time only twenty, signifying a campaign decades in the future). Undeterred, Marius began to campaign for the consulship. Sallust claims that this was catalysed, in part, by a fortune-teller in Utica who \"declared that a great and marvellous career awaited him; the seer accordingly advised him, trusting in the gods, to carry out what he had in mind and put his fortune to the test as often as possible, predicting that all his undertakings would have a happy issue\". [...] many of the problems he faced during his early career in Rome show the difficulties that faced a \"new man\" (novus homo) in being accepted into the stratified upper echelons of Roman society, Marius – even as a young man – was not poor or even middle-class; he was most assuredly born into inherited wealth, gained most likely from large land holdings. In fact, his family's resources were definitely large enough to support not just one member of the family in Roman politics, but two: Marius's younger brother, Marcus Marius \"Marcus Marius (praetor 102 BC)\"), also entered Roman public life. [...] With growing political pressure towards a quick victory over Jugurtha and equestrian hostility toward the senate's conduct of the war, Marius was elected consul for 107 BC, campaigning against Metellus's apparent lack of swift action against Jugurtha, with Lucius Cassius Longinus \"Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)\") as his colleague. The senate prorogued Metellus's command in Numidia, thereby preventing Marius from assuming command. Marius got around this by inducing an ally of his, then-tribune Titus Manlius Mancinus\"), to have the concilium plebis override the Senate's decision and give him the command. Metellus refused to personally hand over command to Marius and returned to Rome. Upon his return, the senate voted Metellus a triumph and the agnomen Numidicus."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship [...] patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the distinguished and inordinately conceited Caecilii Metelli, then at the height of their political power. They backed his candidacy for tribune (defender) of the plebs (common people) in 119. As tribune, Marius proposed a bill affecting procedure in elections and legislative assemblies by narrowing the bridges—the gangway across which each voter passed to fill in and deposit his ballot tablet—as a result of which there was no longer room on the gangway for observers, normally aristocrats, who abused their position to influence an individual’s vote. When the two consuls tried to persuade the Senate to block the bill, Marius threatened them with imprisonment, and the bill was carried."

      "snippet": "So who was Gaius Marius?\n\nHumble origins\n\nMarius started out in an equestrian family which, despite relative affluence, remained outside of Rome’s snobbish aristocracy. He married into a rich family, which gave him the political patronage he needed to become a tribune in 119 BC and a praetor in 115 BC. Serving as a governor in one of Rome’s Spanish provinces, Marius gained priceless military experience from his counter-insurgency campaigns against Rome’s tribal enemies. Carefully and meticulously, the Roman governor studied the hit-and-run tactics of his foes, allowing him to master the art of conquest. [...] Marius further distinguished himself by serving as a junior military officer in the Jugurthine War in 109 BC. Exploiting his military prestige, the unorthodox Marius broke from tradition by running for the consulship in 107 BC. To bolster his electoral prospects, Marius presented himself as a true man of the people. He styled himself as a populist, whose personal competence and merit outshone the arbitrary privileges of Rome’s archaic aristocracy. “They may look down on my humble origins,” the gruff general remarked of Rome’s aristocrats, “but I have nothing but disdain for their idleness.”\n\nShare [...] An outsider by birth, he ascended the ranks of Rome’s upper-class society. He held the consulship for an unprecedented seven times. Yet the unbounded ambition of this larger- than-life Roman general ultimately led to the Republic’s downfall.\n\nSo who was Gaius Marius?\n\nHumble origins"
