So brace yourself for that impromptu meeting with your boss if you haven't been performing well.\n\nWe all know the braces that straighten teeth and keep injured knees in line. But in verb form, brace means to bolster or steady. “Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather,” said John Ruskin, the English writer and cultural critic. He means the wind supports us with its uplifting powers — although those living in tornado country might disagree.\n\nDefinitions of brace [...] Definitions of brace\n\n1. a support that steadies or strengthens something else\n\n   “he wore a brace on his knee”\n\n   see moresee less\n\n   types:\n\n   show 5 types...;)\n\n   hide 5 types...;)\n\n   ankle brace\n\n   a brace worn to strengthen the ankle\n\n   back brace\n\n   a brace worn to support the back\n\n   knee brace\n\n   a brace worn to strengthen the knee\n\n   neck brace\n\n   a brace worn to steady the neck\n\n   skeg\n\n   a brace that extends from the rear of the keel to support the rudderpost\n\n   type of:\n\n   reinforcement, strengthener\n\n   a device designed to provide additional strength\n\n   support\n\n   any device that bears the weight of another thing\n2. noun\n\n   a structural member used to stiffen a framework\n\n   synonyms:  bracing\n\n   see moresee less\n\n   types:\n\n   show 14 types...;) [...] a rope on a square-rigged ship that is used to swing a yard about and secure it\n\n   see moresee less\n\n   types:\n\n   royal brace\n\n   a brace to secure the royal mast\n\n   type of:\n\n   rope\n\n   a strong line\n4. noun\n\n   elastic straps that hold trousers up (usually used in the plural)\n\n   synonyms:  gallus, suspender\n\n   see moresee less\n\n   type of:\n\n   man's clothing\n\n   clothing that is designed for men to wear\n5. noun\n\n   an appliance that corrects dental irregularities\n\n   synonyms:  braces, orthodontic braces\n\n   see moresee less\n\n   type of:\n\n   dental appliance\n\n   a device to repair teeth or replace missing teeth\n6. noun\n\n   a carpenter's tool having a crank handle for turning and a socket to hold a bit for boring\n\n   synonyms:  bitstock\n\n   see moresee less\n\n   type of:"

      "snippet": "To assume a brace position or crash position is an instruction that can be given to prepare for a crash, such as on an aircraft; the instruction to \"Brace for impact!\" or \"Brace! Brace!\" is often given if the aircraft must make an emergency landing on land or water. There are many different ways to adopt the brace position, with many countries adopting their own version based on research performed by their own aviation authority or that of other countries. The most common in passenger airliners being the forward-facing seat version, in which the person bracing places their head against or as close as possible to the surface it is likely to strike (and in the process bending over to some degree), placing their feet firmly on the floor, and their hands either on their head or the seat in [...] A 2015 study by the Federal Aviation Administration has concluded that brace positions, particularly the forward-facing seat position, significantly reduce the risk of head and neck injuries in impacts. When Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751 crashed in 1991, all passengers aboard survived; a \"significant factor\" to this outcome was the passengers' universal adoption of the brace position. During the \"Miracle on the Hudson\" emergency water landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in 2009, the pilot warned \"Brace for impact\" and flight attendants chanted \"Brace! Brace! Brace! Heads down!

      "title": "Meaning and etymology of \"Hat-trick\" and \"Brace\"",
      "snippet": "The word comes from ‘a brace’, which is an old term of venery. It means ‘a pair of [some animal, especially birds] caught in the hunt’. So if you go out looking for dinner, shoot two pheasants, and bring them home, you’ll have a brace of pheasants. It makes sense, then, that a word that means ‘a pair’—in particular, a pair of things that you have managed to obtain through skill—would be a good word to use for scoring two goals in a football match.\n\nThe word ‘brace’ itself is related to the verbs ‘to brace’ and ‘to embrace’: the original meaning (from Old French brace) is ‘[a pair of] arms’. ‘To brace’ originally meant ‘clasp/fasten tightly’, which is a plausible meaning for a verb directly derived from the word for an arm. ‘To embrace’ is simply to put something in [your] arms. [...] Old French brace is quite straightforwardly the regular outcome of Latin bracchia, the plural of the Latin neuter word bracchium ‘arm’, itself a loan from Greek βραχίων ‘arm’. The Greek word is interesting in itself, since it is simply a nominalised form of βραχίων, the comparative of βραχύς ‘short’ (found in English words as the prefix ‘brachy-’). Quite possibly, the word originally meant ‘upper arm’, being then called literally the ‘shorter arm’ (as opposed to the longer lower arm).\n\nΒραχύς, in turn, is related to Latin brevis ‘short’, which (through Old French again) shows up in English as ‘brief’, as well as to some other, rather obscure words (there’s an old Gothic verb gamaurgjan that means ‘to shorten’).\n\nShare\n\nImprove this answer\n\nedited Jul 1, 2018 at 21:45\n\nCommunityBot\n\n1 [...] Not really a very interesting etymology at all—not much enlightenment to be found, I fear, just a silly cricket tradition with a hat.\n\n## Brace\n\n‘Brace’ is more interesting to me. First of all because I didn’t know scoring two goals in a match was called a brace, or anything at all for that matter; but also because it’s more of a ‘real’ etymology."
