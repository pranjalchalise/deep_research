      "snippet": "### Supposed reforms to the legions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the narratives of Plutarch and Sallust, Marius's reforms to the recruitment process for the Roman legions are roundly criticised for creating a soldiery wholly loyal to their generals and beholden to their beneficence or ability to secure payment from the state. However, Evans argues this development did not emerge from Marius, and it was likely initially envisioned as nothing more than a temporary measure to meet the extraordinary threats of Numidia and the Cimbrian tribes. Moreover, the armies in the late republic were broadly similar to those of the middle republic. [...] describes this lex Maria as quite straightforward and uncontroversial. Plutarch reports that he then alienated the plebs by vetoing a bill expanding the grain dole, but it is more likely that Plutarch misinterpreted Marius as vetoing attempts to interfere in the existing grain provisions. [...] Plutarch relates that against the wishes of his patrons, he pushed through a law that restricted the interference of the wealthy in elections. In the 130s, voting by ballot had been introduced in elections for choosing magistrates, passing laws and deciding legal cases, replacing the earlier system of oral voting. The wealthy continued to try to influence the voting by inspecting ballots, and Marius passed a law narrowing the passages down which voters passed to cast their votes in order to prevent outsiders from harassing the electors or seeing who was voted for. It is not clear, however, whether Plutarch's narrative history properly reflects how controversial this proposal in fact was; Cicero, writing during the Republic, describes this lex Maria as quite straightforward and"

      "snippet": "## Gaius Marius\n\nGaius Marius (c. 157 BCE – 86 BCE) was a Roman general and politician who, in his early military career, had served under Scipio Aemilianus (of Third Punic War fame) in an expedition to Numantia in Iberia. He went on to have a distinguished military and political career, but not without controversy. As you will see from the excerpts from Plutarch’s Parallel Lives below, Marius was ambitious, and what was known as a novo homo or “new man” (one who was the first in his family to serve in the Senate and be elected consul). His policies leaned decidedly towards the poulares which also made him enemies among the senators who supported the optimates faction.\n\n### Life of Gaius Marius (excerpts) by Plutarch [...] After several years, victory against the Cimbri and Teutones brought Marius a joint triumph with pro-consul Catulus. His sixth consulship turned triumph to disaster, according to Plutarch, as Marius became involved with the controversial tribune Saterninus (a populares) and supported his reforms lowering the price of wheat, granting land to veterans, and extending citizenship to many of Rome’s allies. Yet Marius ended up breaking with his allies Saturninus and Glaucia and the elections for 99 BCE were mired in political violence including the assassination of one of the candidates, Gaius Memmius, and a violent attack on the Capitoline Hill where Saturninus and Glaucia were besieged with their supporters. Marius had Saturninus and Glaucia arrested, but a mob attacked the senate where they [...] IX. Being declared consul by a great majority [in 107 BCE], he immediately set about levying soldiers in a way contrary to law and usage, by enrolling a great number of the poorer sort and of slaves, though former generals had never admitted men of this kind into the army, but had given arms, as they would anything else that was a badge of honor, only to those who had the due qualification, inasmuch as every soldier was thus considered to pledge his property to the State. It was not this however which made Marius most odious, but his insolent and arrogant expressions, which gave offense to the nobles, for he publicly said that he considered his acquisition of the consulship a trophy gained over the effeminacy of the noble and the rich, and that what he could proudly show to the people was"

      "snippet": "Some Norwegians see the roots of Marius’s Troubles in this tension between his life as a ‘commoner’ ex-motorbike mechanic with two royal half-siblings Ingrid Alexandra and Sverre Magnus, the younger children of Mette-Marit and Haakon.\n\nPrince Haakon and Princess Mette-Marit address a gala dinner for their daughter Princess Ingrid Alexandra, centre. Photograph: Håkon Mosvold Larsen/Getty\n\nNorwegian journalist Torgeir Pedersen Krokfjord is co-author of a bestselling book on the unfolding scandal: Hvite Striper, Sorte Får (White Lines, Black Sheep). He thinks Marius had “a very strange upbringing”.\n\n“It’s comparable to Prince Harry as the ‘spare’, but even worse,” Krokfjord says. “His siblings have formal roles and taxpayer salaries and he has nothing.” [...] For the large part, Aaen-Stockdale sees support for Norway’s royals as based on sentimentality and apathy.\n\n“Only when scandals like this come along do people think, ‘It’s a bit odd, this arrangement’,” he says, reflected in a 2024 membership surge for his organisation. “For now the dominant narrative is ‘Poor King Harald who has to deal with all this chaos around him’. The Marius-as-rotten-apple narrative, which is being heavily pushed here, too, will probably win out.”\n\nBut there is a chance that things could turn out very differently, he thinks, particularly if the trial asks pointed questions about palace-state collaboration – and the number of blind eyes turned to Borg Høiby’s criminality because of his position. [...] Later that year he was arrested again with 130 grams of cocaine, leading to a 31-month prison term.\n\nWhen he was sent to prison in 1998, again on cocaine possession charges, Marius had just been born.\n\nBorg, a financial analyst by profession, was reportedly shocked by Mette-Marit’s news she was pregnant as they had been casual friends and never a couple.\n\nHe has kept a lower profile in recent years, appearing in public for occasions such as Marius’s first day at school. Father and son reportedly spent last Christmas together.\n\nLike his parents in their younger days, Marius has a love of wild parties – but is in the public eye. Tabloids named his regular blowouts with motorbike gang friends “the Skaugum festival”, after the royal family estate."

      "snippet": "The most serious of the new charges allegedly occurred in July 2020, when Marius was said to have received and transported at least 3.5 kilos of marijuana from Lørenskog to Tønsberg (locations located an hour and a half away by car), where he delivered it to a person. The 29-year-old, once seen as a symbol of the openness of the monarchy, has acknowledged those allegations as true, with his attorney noting that he was not paid in the incident.\n\nOther new charges are related to two alleged violations of a restraining order, and three offenses against the Traffic Act. They follow his arrest in August of 2024, when he was accused of assaulting his then girlfriend while in his apartment in Frogner, Oslo. [...] In late 2025, the princess spoke for the first time about the scandal surrounding her son, apologizing \"for things I have not done.\" In November, her daughter, Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway, said when asked about the allegations that “Of course it's difficult. Both for those of us who are around, for me as a sister, and for mom and dad. And, of course, for everyone affected by the case.”\n\nThe trial for Marius Borg Høiby is expected to begin in Oslo district court on February 3. It is expected to continue until March 13. [...] Marius Borg Høiby\n\nThough born to Princess Mette-Marit, Marius Borg Høiby does not have a royal title: his father is businessman Morten Borg, with whom the princess had a relationship before meeting Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway, the heir to the Norwegian throne. When the royal couple married in 2001, Marius was 4 years old. Since then, he has grown up as part of the royal family, but does not have a claim to the throne."

Marcus Hobi further justified the circumstances saying that he had in fact been struggling with substance abuse for a long time and he's also been suffering from mental troubles. The current case against him is not a standalone instance in which the crown prince's stepson is facing the heat from authorities. In the past, several media reports emerged on Hui which claimed that he was seen hanging out with gang members and members of Norwegian mafia from the capital. Back in 2023, police authorities in fact cautioned the son of Norway's crown princess against moving in notorious criminal circles. All these incidents sound very unbecoming of a royal family member, even as a stepson who was not royal by blood, but was raised in Norway's royal household. Is it possible [...] What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of a royal family? Tradition, status symbol, a reminder of history and bygone empires, etiquette, social graces, flamboyance, and maybe charm that is exuded through old-fashioned ways. But this story of a member of Norway's royal family is quite the opposite. It's a story about falling from grace, about committing heinenous crimes and the wheels of justice that have since come full circle. In the spotlight is 28-year-old Marius Bog Hui, the eldest son of Norway's crown princess Meti Marit and the stepson of the heir to the throne, Crowns Prince Hackon. Blonde hair, sllicked back, rings, earrings, and tattoos. A stereotypical image of a bad boy. Marius Borgo has been at the center of a media storm since investigation began [...] the offenses covered by the indictment is imprisonment for up to 10 years. For the prosecution, it is important that there be equality before the law. The fact that Marius Borg Hoy is a member of the royal family should not mean that he is treated more leniently or more severely than if similar offenses had been committed by others. Now, the instances of rape allegedly took place in 2018, 2023, and 2024. In fact, the fourth incident is said to have occurred after officials began probing the accusations against the 28-year-old. Hibi has already admitted to assault and vandalism in the incident from August 2024. But following his arrest, Hobi said that he was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. He went on to say that his actions came amid an argument. Marcus Hobi further justified"
