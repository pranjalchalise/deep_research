      "snippet": "Empirical Validation: The effectiveness of the proposed method is not only discussed theoretically but also validated through empirical cases. The analysis of actual cases provides practical support and verification, enhancing the credibility of the research results.\n Application of MLR Analysis: The paper employs MLR analysis to delve into the impact of various factors on RA. This quantitative analysis method adds specificity and operability to the research, offering a practical decision-making basis for scientific and technological project management. [...] This paper distinguishes itself from existing research by conducting an in-depth analysis of the intricate interactions among various factors, offering more nuanced and specific RA outcomes. The primary objective extends beyond problem exploration, aiming to broaden the scope of scientific evaluation and research practice through the application of statistical language. This research goal endows the paper with considerable significance in the realm of science and technology project management. In comparison to traditional methods, this paper scrutinizes project risk with greater granularity, furnishing project managers with more actionable suggestions. The empirical analysis validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, introducing a fresh perspective for decision-making in science [...] The paper makes several key contributions. Firstly, it applies the Naive Bayes algorithm to assess the risks associated with SRPs, proposing the TANB and validating its effectiveness empirically. The introduction of the TANB model broadens the application scope of the Naive Bayes algorithm in scientific research risk management, offering novel methodologies for project RA. Secondly, the study delves into the impact of various factors on RA for SRPs through MLR analysis, highlighting the significance of budget investment and team experience. The results underscore the positive influence of budget investment and team experience on RA outcomes, offering valuable insights for project decision-making. Additionally, the paper examines the interaction between team experience and budget"

Upon conducting a review of ongoing Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), Post Approval, and Post Market studies, this sponsor found itself in a position to employ RBM models across multiple regulatory scenarios. Risk Assessment: RBM Applications Maintaining confidence in how RBM was being utilized was critical to the organization. Applying a formal Risk Assessment process was a useful operationalization step. Applying structured Risk Assessment to both new and ongoing studies fostered stakeholder confidence that projects most likely to benefit from RBM strategies were being correctly identified. This assessment (Table 1) [...] overall Site Risk Assessment. For example, if two sites had exactly the same KRI data, but one site was designated a Low risk and the other as a Moderate risk, the Moderate risk site would first cross the threshold for assessment of additional monitoring. Thus, Site Risk Level as a modifier to the Site Risk Assessment scores better categorizes an individual site’s risk profile.

In keeping with the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, the sponsor pursued the following approach: 1. Risk Assessment and Risk Categorization (Planning Phase): Identification and categorization of the likelihood, impact, and detectability of an untoward event or occurrence. 2. Central Monitoring: Process definition for continual production and review of data both at a site and at a study level (risk indicators, system tools, and reports). In order to visualize the full picture and create consistency, cross-functional expertise was incorporated into the review of periodic data through the incorporation of a central team. 3. Response/Action: A process to ensure that any issues noted from these periodic reviews were appropriately dealt with based on severity, owners assigned, and tracked to"

      "snippet": "used to answer more specific questions and provide a richer description of the risks. Most studies show that PRA can improve or expand on information generated by deterministic methods. In some of the case studies, the use of multiple PRA tools is illustrated. For example, Case Study 1 describes the use of a point estimate sensitivity analysis to identify exposure variables critical to the analysis summarized in Case Study 9. Both of these case studies focus on children’s exposure to chromated copper arsenate (CCA)‐treated wood. In Case Study 9, an MCA was used as an example of a two‐dimensional (i.e., addressing both variability and uncertainty) probabilistic exposure assessment. Overall, the case studies illustrate that the Agency already has applied the science of PRA to ecological [...] process can be assessed. These case studies explored the assessment of ozone monitoring networks and air quality management policies that seek to minimize the adverse impacts from ozone, fine particulate matter and air toxics simultaneously. These case studies demonstrate the importance and feasibility of better understanding the uncertainty introduced by specific choices (e.g., selecting input data, models, and scenarios) when making public policy decisions. 17 2.2. When Is Probabilistic Risk Analysis Applicable or Useful? PRA may be particularly useful, for example, in the following (Cooke 1991; Cullen and Frey 1999; NRC 2009; USEPA 2001):  When a screening‐level DRA indicates that risks are possibly higher than a level of concern and a more refined assessment is needed.  When the [...] Agency already has applied the science of PRA to ecological risk and human exposure estimation and has begun using PRA to describe health effects. Some of the applications have used existing “off‐the‐shelf” software, whereas others have required significant effort and resources. Once developed, however, some of the more complex models have been used many times for different assessments. All of the assessments have been validated by internal and external peer review. Table 1 gives some highlights the case studies from deterministic to more complex assessments, which are described in more detail in the Appendix. 14 Table 1.

      "snippet": "sector. Case studies introduce the application of FMEA in highly IT-relevant fields, just like internet banking services  and healthcare systems.  The traditional concept of FMEA is to identify the existing or possible failures and their cause, estimating the risks of the failures and reducing the risk of the failure. The target field of the analysis is traditionally a product or a process. First, a cross-functional team is set up to identify the relevant existing or possible failures using creative techniques. Identifying the failures can be a long process, depending on the nature, complexity, and size of the particular product or process. Once the cross-functional team identifies the failures, the team performs the risk analysis phase of the methodology. The most crucial goal of the [...] is to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations, and the credibility of the financial reports. Over the last 20 years, new regulations are being created to such an extent and quantity that compliance with them has become an independent task. This phenomenon has given rise to the organizational function of compliance management. The core definition of compliance is obeying various pieces of internal and external legislation. More recently, a more comprehensive perspective incorporates following the letter and the spirit of the legislation. Compliance management is a support function that aims to manage or minimize the risks of organizational wrongdoing and legal non-F. Bognár, et al.

Like data loss or information privacy, IT compliance issues affect every department of any organization's daily procedures. This paper focuses on the presentation of a novel risk assessment methodology via the evaluation of compliance risks. We assume that a combined Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Risk Map (RM) method can be applied to assess and monitor different kinds of risks, like compliance-related risks. Using the previously mentioned method, organizations would formulate measures for the organization's current, individual operation to reduce error modes' frequency or improve failure and error detection.
