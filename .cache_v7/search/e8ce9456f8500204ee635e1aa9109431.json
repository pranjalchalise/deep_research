      "snippet": "So who was Gaius Marius?\n\nHumble origins\n\nMarius started out in an equestrian family which, despite relative affluence, remained outside of Rome’s snobbish aristocracy. He married into a rich family, which gave him the political patronage he needed to become a tribune in 119 BC and a praetor in 115 BC. Serving as a governor in one of Rome’s Spanish provinces, Marius gained priceless military experience from his counter-insurgency campaigns against Rome’s tribal enemies. Carefully and meticulously, the Roman governor studied the hit-and-run tactics of his foes, allowing him to master the art of conquest. [...] Share\n\nUpon winning the Social War, Sulla became Rome’s consul in 88 BC. Unlike Marius, Sulla came from an aristocratic background. Although he frequented the company of lower-class dancers and actors, Sulla was determined to restore the wealth and privilege of his noble family. Sulla’s ego clashed with that of Marius, setting the stage for civil war in Rome. Marius still enjoyed a greater reputation, so Sulla needed to find his own military glory. [...] Marius further distinguished himself by serving as a junior military officer in the Jugurthine War in 109 BC. Exploiting his military prestige, the unorthodox Marius broke from tradition by running for the consulship in 107 BC. To bolster his electoral prospects, Marius presented himself as a true man of the people. He styled himself as a populist, whose personal competence and merit outshone the arbitrary privileges of Rome’s archaic aristocracy. “They may look down on my humble origins,” the gruff general remarked of Rome’s aristocrats, “but I have nothing but disdain for their idleness.”\n\nShare"

He fought first with Scipio Aemilianus\nin Spain, and later with\nMetellus in Africa. In the Jugurthine War he served with such\ndistinction that in 107 B.C. he was elected consul, and took over command.\nWithin a year he had captured many towns\nand nearly brought the war to a close but still hadn't captured Jugurtha. Eventually, his lieutenant\nSulla set up an ambush, and received credit for capturing Jugurtha. Unfortunately for Rome, this\nminor rivalry led to much more cataclysmic disputes in years to come.\n\n|  | [...] Marius\n\nMarius spent two years in Africa tending to local administration before returning to Rome. He won\nhis second consulship in 104 B.C., and shortly afterward achieved great renown\nfor defeating the Teutone and Cimbri invaders in northern Italy.\nThese victories brought him great\npopularity with both the people of Rome, and the army, and he was elected consul five years in\nsuccession, from 104 to 100 B.C., an unprecedented run. During this period he\nreorganized the army, an achievement that laid the ground work for the Roman legions of imperial\ndays. Under Marius, Rome established for the first time a standing army, manned by professional\nsoldiers. During this period Marius achieved great things for Rome, enjoyed immense popularity, and\nwas called the \"Third Founder of Rome.\" [...] During the next decade the influence of his rival Sulla grew. When the\nSocial War finally broke out\nin Italy, between Rome and some of her rival cities, Sulla took a leadership role, while Marius\nserved only for a single campaign. He was sixty six years old, and his health was starting to fail.\nThe following year however, when Sulla was appointed to lead an army against\nMithradates, his\njealousy overcame his better judgment, and Marius induced his allies in the senate to recall Sulla\nand give the command to him. Sulla would not stand for this and marched back to Rome with his army,\nsending Marius into exile. The exile of Marius was a dramatic episode, as he was chased all over\nItaly and eventually to Carthage, with Sulla's forces in hot pursuit."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship"

In fact, his family's resources were definitely large enough to support not just one member of the family in Roman politics, but two: Marius's younger brother, Marcus Marius \"Marcus Marius (praetor 102 BC)\"), also entered Roman public life. [...] After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate [...] Marius attained his first consulship in 107 BC and became the commander of Roman forces in Numidia, where he brought an end to the Jugurthine War. By 105 BC Rome faced an invasion by the Cimbri and Teutones, and the comitia centuriata elected Marius consul for a second time to face this new threat. Marius was consul every year from 104 to 100 BC, and he defeated the Teutones at Aquae Sextiae and the Cimbri at Vercellae. However, Marius suffered political setbacks during his sixth consulship in 100 BC and afterwards entered a period of semi-retirement from public life."

The younger Marius reached the estate of Mucius, but as he was getting supplies and packing them up, day overtook him and he did not altogether escape the vigilance of his enemies; for some horsemen came riding towards the place, moved by suspicion. 7 When the overseer of the farm saw them coming, he hid Marius in a waggon loaded with beans, yoked up his oxen, and met the horsemen as he was driving the waggon to the city. In this way young Marius was conveyed to the house of his wife, where he got what he wanted, and then by night came to the sea, boarded a ship that was bound for Africa, and crossed over.

Perhaps, too, he was afraid of the soldiers, who were drawn up and ready, in case Catulus were deprived of his honour, to prevent Marius also from celebrating a triumph. [...] 34 1 But when the Italians had at last made their submission, and many persons at Rome were suing for the command in the Mithridatic war, with the aid of the popular leaders, contrary to all expectation the tribune Sulpicius, a most audacious man, brought Marius forward and proposed to make him pro-consul in command against Mithridates. The people were divided in opinion, some preferring Marius, and others called for Sulla and bidding Marius go to the warm baths at Baiae and look out for his health, since he was worn out with old age and rheums, as he himself said. 2 For at Baiae, near Cape Misenum, Marius owned an expensive house, which had appointments more luxurious and effeminate p557than became a man who had taken active part in so many wars and campaigns.

When Gaius Marius, an experienced soldier unconnected with the senatorial order, offered to remove the conduct of the Jugurthine War (111-105 b.c.e.) from the hands of the senate-appointed generals, he was elected to office by a large popular majority. Furthermore, over the objections of the senate, Marius was entrusted with the African campaign.

[...] Research Starters Home\n\nEBSCO Knowledge Advantage TM\n\n# Gaius Marius Creates a Private Army\n\nGaius Marius, a significant figure in Roman military history, transformed the Roman army from a citizen militia into a professional force during the late second century BCE. This transformation was necessitated by the demands of Rome's expanding empire, which required larger, longer-serving armies. Traditional recruitment methods, reliant on property ownership, became increasingly strained as small landholders struggled to balance farming and military service, particularly with the influx of cheap grain from conquered territories that undermined their livelihoods."
