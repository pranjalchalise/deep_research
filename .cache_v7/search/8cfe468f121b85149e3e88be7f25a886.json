By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern [...] (Offered as HIST 138 and ASLC 138) At the dawn of the sixteenth century, the world’s largest land-based empires were in the Islamic world, stretching from the Atlantic shores of Morocco across the Indian Ocean to Pacific coasts of Indonesia, from the steppe of Central Asia to Zanzibar in East Africa. We depart from the origins of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula to explore the evolution of legal and scholarly traditions, art, architecture, science, technology, literature and a wide array of social institutions as they took shape across fast expanding Islamic empires. We will also move beyond dynasties, politics, and religion to dissect social categories like gender, race, and class as they evolved in Islamic societies and the role of non-Muslims in making the Islamic world, both as subjects [...] schools and the canonization of Confucian thought, establishment of the civil examination system and a bureaucratic state, the formation of a literati elite and its culture, rise of Buddhism and Daoism, evolution of gender, family, and kinship structures, and China’s engagement with the outside world through trade and diplomacy. In this course, students will engage a wide range of primary sources—ancient classics, poems, films, paintings, novels, and memoirs—and learn to develop skills in reading these sources in their historical contexts. At several points in the semester, we will also look at how this history has been used and recycled in contemporary politics and popular culture and reflect upon the continuing legacies of this history for China and the world today. Classes will entail"

      "snippet": "INDEX AS GATEKEEPER TOWARD DIALOGIC REASONING: PEIRCE AND BEYOND Donna E. West State University of New York at Cortland, USA westsimon@twcny.rr.com Abstract This inquiry capitalizes on the relational character of Peirce’s index. Its evolution from object finder in the physical world, to enhancer of communication between minds, to modal/perspecti­ val coordinator is examined. Its relational character organizes events into episodes, and obviates perspectival alterations in dialogic reasoning. This shift demonstrates Peirce’s last word regard­ ing Index: a sign intrinsically dialogic, whose interpretants increase levels of consciousness, and advance communicational interaction by commanding self/others to believe/act in novel ways. Its power to coordinate specific, vivid images provides [...] Its power to coordinate specific, vivid images provides index with the means to suggest novel propositions, assertions, and arguments. Peirce memorializes this relational role by charac­ terizing index as Pheme, and as Dicisign (1904: 8.334-9; 1906: MS295: 26; 1908: EP2:489-90). Ultimately, index integrates the logical with the phenomenological and the empirical with the semiotic – when it deploys relational operators to trace event templates and to predict partici­ pant’s perspectives. As such, interpreters restructure thought and action and recommend sound courses of action for diverse event participants. 1.
