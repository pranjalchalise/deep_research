      "snippet": "Retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a process applied to LLMs to make their outputs more relevant in specific contexts. RAG allows LLMs to access and reference information outside the LLMs own training data, such as an organization’s specific knowledge base, before generating a response—and, crucially, with citations included. This capability enables LLMs to produce highly specific outputs without extensive fine-tuning or training, delivering some of the benefits of a custom LLM at considerably less expense. [...] Drafting assistants. When an employee starts drafting a report or document that requires company-specific data or information, the RAG system retrieves the relevant information from enterprise data sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, and other systems, then provides the employee with prepopulated sections of the document. This output can help the employee develop the document more efficiently and more accurately. [...] Data quality issues. If the knowledge that RAG is sourcing is not accurate or up to date, the resulting output may be incorrect.\n Multimodal data. RAG may not be able to read certain graphs, images, or complex slides, which can lead to issues in the generated output. New multimodal LLMs, which can parse complex data formats, can help mitigate this.\n Bias. If the underlying data contains biases, the generated output is likely to be biased as well.\n Data access and licensing concerns. Intellectual property, licensing, and privacy and security issues related to data access need to be considered throughout the design of a RAG system."

      "snippet": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a method for improving language model outputs by adding relevant information retrieved from external sources.\n\nThe system turns a user query into a vector, searches a database for matching documents, and inserts those documents into the model's prompt. This process helps the model give more accurate responses and reduces errors when the query depends on current or specialized knowledge.\n\n## Why is RAG central to today's AI discussions?\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation is at the center of today's AI discussions because it tackles one of the most pressing challenges of large language models: relevance. [...] Retrieval-augmented generation offers a way around those limits. By combining model output with live access to external sources, it solves problems that training alone cannot.\n\n One benefit is grounding.\n\n  Grounding links a model's answers to real evidence instead of relying only on what it memorized during training.\n\n  Large language models can generate fluent text, but they don't always know if it's correct. This can lead to hallucinations—confident answers that are not backed by evidence.\n\n  RAG reduces this risk by pulling in external documents so outputs are tied to verifiable sources.\n Another is scalability.\n\n  Fine-tuning models for each new task is costly and time consuming. It also creates static versions that must be retrained whenever information changes. [...] A large language model generates outputs based on its training data alone. RAG adds a retrieval step, pulling information from external sources to guide responses. This makes RAG more adaptable and reduces errors in specialized or fast-changing domains.\n\nA customer support chatbot using RAG can retrieve answers from a company’s knowledge base. Instead of relying on pretraining, it combines live documentation with the model’s reasoning to deliver accurate, up-to-date responses.\n\nRAG grounds responses in retrieved documents. By anchoring outputs to verifiable sources, it reduces hallucinations and improves reliability. This is especially important for tasks requiring factual accuracy or domain-specific knowledge."

      "snippet": "# What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\n## What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architecture for optimizing the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) model by connecting it with external knowledge bases. RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\n\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs. However, training datasets are finite and limited to the information the AI developer can access—public domain works, internet articles, social media content and other publicly accessible data. [...] Standard LLMs source information from their training datasets. RAG adds an information retrieval component to the AI workflow, gathering relevant information and feeding that to the generative AI model to enhance response quality and utility.\n\nRAG systems follow a five-stage process:\n\n1. The user submits a prompt.\n2. The information retrieval model queries the knowledge base for relevant data.\n3. Relevant information is returned from the knowledge base to the integration layer.\n4. The RAG system engineers an augmented prompt to the LLM with enhanced context from the retrieved data.\n5. The LLM generates an output and returns an output to the user. [...] This process showcases how RAG gets its name. The RAG system retrieves data from the knowledge base, augments the prompt with added context and generates a response.\n\n## Components of a RAG system\n\nRAG systems contain four primary components:\n\n The knowledge base: The external data repository for the system.\n\n The retriever: An AI model that searches the knowledge base for relevant data.\n\n The integration layer: The portion of the RAG architecture that coordinates its overall functioning.\n\n The generator: A generative AI model that creates an output based on the user query and retrieved data.\n\nOther components might include a ranker, which ranks retrieved data based on relevance, and an output handler, which formats the generated response for the user.\n\n### The knowledge base"

      "snippet": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that improves text generation by incorporating data from databases, digital asset libraries, or other knowledge sources. Imagine a legal team searching for precedents in a vast collection of case law documents. Through RAG, they could quickly get a summary of a retrieved document and identify key points that they can validate and use to support their arguments.\n\nThanks to artificial intelligence (AI), this process happens in seconds. RAG uses AI-driven large language models (LLMs) — trained on massive datasets of text and code — to generate accurate and contextual content based on sources like documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. [...] 1. Retrieval: A system, often based on semantic search, identifies relevant documents from your cloud data storage or any other knowledge source\n2. Augmentation: The retrieved information is combined with an LLM’s pre-trained data to create a more informative prompt, integrating the LLM with additional context\n3. Generation: The LLM generates an answer to the query, using the understanding of language and the information from your documents to create a more relevant response [...] For your enterprise to fully take advantage of AI, you need to continuously feed its model with contextual and up-to-date information. That’s where RAG steps in, integrating real-time data to make sure the outputs are precise and relevant. Without RAG, your business would be stuck with pre-trained LLMs that can miss critical, updated context, leading to inaccurate results and the risk of AI hallucinations.\n\nIf you’re wondering whether RAG can exist without artificial intelligence, the short answer is no. The “generation” capability of RAG relies on AI systems, which means you need a generative model to produce answers to your questions or prompts. Let’s review how this process works.\n\n## How does retrieval-augmented generation work?"

      "snippet": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) comes as a breakthrough in natural language processing, blending the power of pre-trained language models with the vast knowledge stored in external textual databases. RAG is a framework designed to enhance language generation tasks by retrieving and conditioning on relevant documents, effectively augmenting the pool of information a model can draw from when generating text. This fusion of retrieval and generation facilitates more informed and contextually relevant outputs, particularly in question-answering and conversational AI systems. [...] The architecture of RAG operates by first querying a dataset of documents to find content that is likely to be relevant to the input query. It then conditions the generation process of the language model on the retrieved documents, allowing the model to integrate the external information into its responses. Unlike traditional models that rely solely on information seen during training, RAG can adapt to new questions and topics by tapping into updated and specific information from external sources. [...] ## Challenges in RAG\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models integrate large-scale knowledge bases with powerful language models. However, they face several critical challenges that can impact their effectiveness and application.\n\n### Data quality and bias\n\nData quality: A key challenge for RAG models is ensuring high data quality. The model's performance is contingent upon the relevance and accuracy of information retrieved from external data sources.\n\n Inaccurate data can lead to misinformation in generated content.\n Irrelevant data can confuse the model, resulting in off-topic outputs.\n\nBias: Another aspect is bias present in the training datasets. The language model may propagate or even amplify this bias, leading to problematic outputs."

      "snippet": "RAG evaluations help assess how well a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system retrieves relevant context and generates grounded, accurate responses.\n   RAG consists of two core parts: retrieval (finding useful info) and generation (producing the final answer). These can be evaluated separately.\n   Retrieval evaluation includes ranking metrics like recall@k with ground truth, or manual/LLM-judged relevance scoring of retrieved context.\n   Reference-based generation evaluation compares outputs to correct answers using LLM judges or semantic similarity.\n   Reference-free generation evaluation can check for response faithfulness, completeness, tone or structural qualities. [...] For example, if you are building a customer support chatbot, you can’t expect the LLM to know your company policies. Instead, you can set up a system that retrieves the relevant document when the user asks a question – and uses it to generate the response.\n\nImage 29: What is RAG\n\n> The term “RAG” was introduced in Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks (Lewis et al., 2020). The RAG architecture combines retrieval over a large corpus with generation, enabling models to ground outputs in external knowledge sources at inference time.\n\nRAG works in two steps:\n\n   First, the system retrieves relevant information – that’s the “R.”\n   Then, it uses that information to generate the answer – that’s the “G.”"
