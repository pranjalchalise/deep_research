(2013) with artiﬁcial paragraph to-kens, which accumulate the meaning of words ap-pearing in the respective paragraphs.\nIn contrast to these shallow methods, other ap-proaches employ deep multi-layer networks for the processing of sentences. Examples include Kalch-brenner et al.\n(2014), who employ convolutional neural networks for analyzing the sentiment of sen-tences, and Socher et al.

      "snippet": "Biperpedia: An Ontology for Search Applications Rahul Gupta† Alon Halevy† Xuezhi Wang§∗ Steven Euijong Whang† Fei Wu† †Google Research §Carnegie Mellon University {grahul, halevy, swhang, wufei}@google.com xuezhiw@cs.cmu.edu ABSTRACT Search engines make signiﬁcant efforts to recognize queries that can be answered by structured data and invest heavily in creating and maintaining high-precision databases. While these databases have a relatively wide coverage of entities, the number of attributes they model (e.g., GDP, CAPITAL, ANTHEM) is relatively small. Ex-tending the number of attributes known to the search engine can enable it to more precisely answer queries from the long and heavy tail, extract a broader range of facts from the Web, and recover the semantics of tables on the Web. [...] • We describe an algorithm for attaching attributes to the most appropriate class in a given class hierarchy. Such an algorithm is crucial in order to contribute attributes from Biperpedia into other ontologies.\n• We demonstrate the utility of Biperpedia by showing that it can help interpret the semantics of Web tables. We describe a schema matching algorithm that leverages Biperpedia and in-creases the number of tables we can interpret by more than a factor of 4 compared to what is possible with the schema of Freebase alone.\n• We experimentally validate Biperpedia’s high precision and re-call for attributes of interest. In particular, we obtain over 0.5 precision for the top 5000 attributes. Among those attributes, only 1% exist in Freebase and 1% in DBpedia . [...] While the databases serving structured data in search results have a relatively wide coverage of entities (e.g., Sweden, Gerhard Weikum, Ghostbusters), the number of attributes they model (e.g., CAPITAL, PUBLICATIONS, RELEASE DATE) is relatively small. For example, for the class COUNTRIES, Freebase has less than 200 attributes, whereas the number of attributes of interest is in the thousands.\n∗Work done while on leave from Carnegie Mellon University at Google Research.\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.
