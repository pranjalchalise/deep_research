Automating tasks that don't require human intervention saves money and time, and can reduce the risk of human error. Here are a couple of ways AI could be employed in different industries: [...] Despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether “true” intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today, they’re referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT or computer vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data.\n\n### How about artificial \"general\" intelligence?\n\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to a theoretical state in which computer systems will be able to achieve or exceed human intelligence. In other words, AGI is “true” artificial intelligence, as depicted in countless science fiction novels, television shows, movies, and comics."

The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since their development in the 1940s, digital computers have been programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency.

Theoretically, these systems would have the ability to improve themselves and make decisions with above-human-level intelligence. Beyond simply mimicking or identifying human behavior, superintelligent AI would grasp it at a fundamental level. Empowered with these human traits—and further augmented with massive processing and analytical power—it could far exceed our own abilities. If a superintelligent AI system were developed it could change the course of human history, but currently it exists only in science fiction, and there is no known method of achieving this level of AI.\n\nHow does artificial intelligence work? [...] General AI (also known as strong AI):In theory, an AI system that would be able to successfully perform any intellectual task that a human could—possibly even better than a human could. Like narrow AI systems, general AI systems would be able to learn from experience and spot and predict patterns, but they would have the capacity to take things a step further, extrapolating that knowledge across a wide range of tasks and situations that are not addressed by previously acquired data or existing algorithms. General AI does not yet exist, though there is ongoing research and development in the field with some promising progress."
