      "snippet": "Growing up in Lexington, Kentucky, one would think Lee would be an Olympic equestrian, but Lee fell in love with a different Olympic sport—fencing. Her love of fencing came from her father and her siblings, as they all shared a fervent passion for the sport. They were a fencing family, through and through. “We would drive an hour and half to the closet fencing club. And on top of that, my dad would give us footwork lessons in our empty dining room at home,” Lee remembers. She started going to local tournaments and then national events. Determined to improve their abilities and compete at the highest levels, her family recruited a well-known coach to move to Lexington and build up the fencing community locally. By the time she was 13, Lee was traveling internationally for fencing [...] Standing at only five-foot four, Lee is on the smaller side for a fencer, but she found an unexpected advantage to her size. Her lower center of gravity allows her to move faster and change directions quickly to avoid getting touched. “When I first started fencing, people doubted me because of my size, but I have turned it into an advantage,” Lee admits. “I found my own place. I’m very fast. I’m very hard to hit.” As Lee’s fencing career progressed, she soon found herself on the verge of realizing a dream: making Team USA and going to the Olympic Games.\n\nYou have to be quick to adapt, to learn, to be gritty. Other times you need to be brave and take risks.\n\n### Medalist [...] Lee and her family not only practice the sport but further their dedication to this art that is inextricably linked to the Games. Fencing has been an Olympic sport since the inaugural Games in 1896 and is made up of three different disciplines: foil, epée, and saber. Each discipline has its own unique rules and nuances, but the basics are similar: touch your opponent with either the tip, for foil and epée, or the blade, for saber, before they touch you in the valid target area. Seems simple, but those touches can happen quicker than the blink of an eye. So, to get 15 points to win the bout, strategy plays a big role. Before Lee even picks up her foil, she already has a gameplan. “I do my homework before competitions to study my opponents,” Lee explained. With the speed and strategy needed"

      "snippet": "Lee is the first Hmong-American Olympian. She is also reported to be the first woman of Hmong descent and first Asian American woman to win the Olympic all-around title. She is a six-time member of the U.S. women's national gymnastics team, and with nine world championship and Olympic medals, she is the seventh-most-decorated American female gymnast.\n\nLee has received numerous honors and awards. In 2021, she was named Female Athlete of the Year by Sports Illustrated, named Sportswoman of the Year by the Women's Sports Foundation, and included in Time 100, Time \"Time (magazine)\")'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

When Lee started doing backflips outdoors, it became clear to her parents that she needed a safer venue to hone her skills. They registered her for gymnastics classes at Midwest Gymnastics Center in Little Canada, Minnesota, where she started training under coach Punnarith Koy. The following year, Lee won the all-around at a state meet, the second competition of her career. At age eight, she moved up three levels, and she qualified for elite at age 11. Koy coached Lee from age six to about 12, when she switched to Jess Graba, who has coached her ever since.\n\n## Gymnastics career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Junior career\n\n[edit]"

He set an unofficial world record of 44.0 seconds in the 400 metres during the 1968 Olympic trials. [...] When two of Evans’s San Jose State University teammates were banned from the 1968 Olympics for their black militant protest during an awards ceremony, Evans threatened to drop out of the 400-metre race in a show of support. In the end, however, he elected to run, beginning with a burst of speed and winning a narrow victory. His winning time was measured by automatic timing at 43.86 seconds, setting a world record that would stand until 1988, when Butch Reynolds of the United States posted a time of 43.29 seconds; the high altitude in Mexico City was an advantage in Evans’s record-setting run. At the same Olympics, Evans anchored the U.S. team that won the 4 × 400-metre relay, setting a world record of 2 min 56.1 sec. He expected to race again in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, West Germany,"
