Lee's Campaigns: summer 1862 to summer 1863 ........................... 6 iii Preface The American Civil War is one of the most dynamic struggles that the world has ever seen. The future of a nation and a race of people depended on the outcome. My interest in this war began as a young boy living in Richmond, Virginia and has continued to grow over the years. In the time since my introduction to this conflict I have found that the Civil War has many layers, each of them feeding my desire to explore it more. This analysis is the product of the exploration of another layer. Specifically, it is an exploration and examination of General Robert E. Lee and the Confederacy's prosecution of the war [...] was willing to sully its reputation by aligning with the Confederacy. Based on this alone, Lee's hope that these nations would align with the Confederacy, either before or after Antietam, can be considered misguided at best. In the final analysis of the Battle of Antietam, the Confederate strategic ends could not be justified by the sacrifice of precious means (troops and materiel). Put another way, Lee's offensive minded operational art did not appear to be in concert with the strategic aims of the Confederacy. Following Antietam, the Battle of Chancellorsville, occmTing 1-3 May, 1863, marked the next crucial engagement of the Civil War. As identified by Stephen Sears in his book Chancellorsville, this battle was \"the most remarkable of Robert E. Lee's victories ... \"69 Sears's 13"

      "snippet": "maintain the Union, and increase anxiety among the Federal government, Lee envisioned maneuvering his army onto northern soil for a second time during the Civil War. By shifting the war from one fought purely on southern land, to one in which both sides would feel its devastation, Lee believed he could force the North to sue for peace vice continuing. In a meeting between Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Lee, both men agreed that a second Nmthern campaign was the most viable option. Conclusion: General Lee's hopes that his audacious actions could produce such a profound effect on the will of the nmthern populace to maintain the Union and sway the Federal government and military to capitulate was based on assumption wrought with flaws. A combination of mistakes prior to and dming [...] and whose patience and mentorship allowed for the accomplishment of this thesis. v Introduction General Robe1t E Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania on a second Northern campaign in the summer of 1863 and the crucial Battle of Gettysburg that ensued was one of the most pivotal strategic decisions of the American Civil War. In the spring of 1863, Union forces pressured the Confederacy on all fronts, particularly in the west. Moreover, as the war continued, the Confederacy was gradually losing public support not only from within its own populace but from the Nmthern anti-war movement and European sympathizers. The ravaged South was devastated economically and agriculturally. The Confederacy found it increasingly difficult to resupply its troops with much needed reinforcements and provisions. [...] 51 Lee's analysis of the North's center of gravity and critical vulnerability was correct in assessing the only way the Confederacy could succeed was through a war of exhaustion and the defeat of the North's political and popular determination to maintain the Union. However, in his assessment that the South had the political or military might to do this in one campaign, he was wrong. The ultimate dilemma for the Confederacy was the terms it demanded for ending the war. The secession of the South and the independence of the Confederacy were never acceptable terms to the North.52 The South lacked critical time to make a war of exhaustion work. Therefore, Lee's vision of victory over the Federal Army and plan to accomplish it in a single campaign never would have worked unless he fought a"

      "snippet": "The first problem was that Robert E Lee’s tactics, like his strategy, were too aggressive. Bevin Alexander pointed out that in 1862 alone Lee had “an obsession with seeking battle to retrieve a strategic advantage when it had gone awry or he thought it had.” Thus, at Beaver Dam Creek (Gaines’ Mill), Frayser’s Farm (Glendale), Malvern Hill, and Antietam, he resorted to “desperate, stand-up, head-on battle” that resulted in great losses. “This fixation was Lee’s fatal flaw. It and Lee’s limited strategic vision cost the Confederacy the war.” Elsewhere Alexander concluded, “Lee never understood the revolution that the Minié ball had brought to battle tactics. . . . This tendency to move to direct confrontation, regardless of the prospects of the losses that would be sustained, guaranteed [...] Despite these significant new advantages held by the defense, during battle after battle, Lee frontally attacked and counterattacked with his splendid and irreplaceable troops. Military historian Bevin Alexander asserted that Lee’s obsession with seeking battle and his limited strategic vision lost the war. The short-term results of Lee’s overly aggressive tactics were his troops’ injury, death, and capture; the long-term results were dissipation of the South’s finite resources and loss of the war. [...] Despite the fact that seven of eight Civil War frontal assaults failed, Lee just kept attacking. Battles in which Lee damaged his army with overly aggressive tactics include the Seven Days’ (particularly Mechanicsville, Gaines’ Mill, and Malvern Hill), Second Manassas, Chantilly, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Rappahannock Station, the Wilderness, and Fort Stedman. Archer Jones pointed to Lee’s periodic misplaced elation when he refused to “quit while he was ahead,” and cited Malvern Hill, Chantilly, the end of Chancellorsville, and Pickett’s Charge as examples."

      "snippet": "Although Lee did not want to fight a defensive war, he was in fact far more gifted in conducting it than offensive war. His 1864 campaign in Virginia was one of the most brilliant holding actions in military history. Though he commanded an army with only a shadow of its former power, Lee neutralized the attacks of Ulysses S. Grant, destroyed half of Grant's army, forced the Federals into a stalemate in front of Petersburg, and permitted the Confederacy to survive into 1865.\n\nIf Lee had embarked on such a defensive strategy from the outset, while he still had strength to make temporary strikes to keep Federal armies from penetrating into Virginia, the North might have been stymied and might have agreed to a negotiated peace. [...] The key to understanding Lee as a commander is that he sought from first to last to fight an offensive war---that is, a war of battles and marches against the armies of the North. This offensive war, though it produced many spectacular clashes and campaigns which arouse fascination to this day, ultimately failed because Lee's methods and his strategy were insufficient to overcome the South's weakness in arms and manpower.\n\nLee endeavored to avoid the defensive war that President Jefferson Davis wanted to conduct. Davis was little interested in winning battlefield victories. His principal aim was to keep the Union from winning, in the hope that the Northern people would become weary and grant the South its independence. [...] None of Lee's victories resulted in the destruction of a Federal army, and none caused so many losses that the North was induced to quit. Both Lee's victories and defeats produced such heavy casualties that the South was bled white in only a year of battle, from the Seven Days in June-July 1862 to Gettysburg in July 1863. These losses destroyed the offensive power of the Confederacy, and foreshadowed the South's defeat.\n\nNevertheless, Robert E. Lee was so superior as a military commander to the leaders of the North that the Confederacy's inherent weaknesses were not apparent until nearly the end of the war. Time after time---not by greater power but by aggressive action and movements forcefully and confidently carried out---Lee defeated or neutralized superior Union forces."

He insisted the war was over and energetically campaigned for inter-sectional reconciliation. \"So far from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interests of the South.\"\n\n## Summaries of Lee's Civil War battles\n\nThe following are summaries of Civil War campaigns and major battles where Robert E. Lee was the commanding officer: [...] Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807 – October 12, 1870) was a Confederate general whose early actions in the American Civil War led to his appointment as the overall commander of the Confederate States Army near the end of the war. He led the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy's most powerful army, from 1862 until its surrender in 1865, earning a reputation as one of the war's most skilled tacticians. [...] > According to my notion of military history there is as much instruction both in strategy and in tactics to be gleaned from General Lee's operations of 1862 as there is to be found in Napoleon's campaigns of 1796.\n\n— British Field Marshal Garnet Wolseley\n\nMilitary historians continue to pay attention to his battlefield tactics and maneuvering, though many think he should have designed better strategic plans for the Confederacy. He was not given full direction of the Southern war effort until late in the conflict."
