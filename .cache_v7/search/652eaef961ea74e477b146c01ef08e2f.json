The first production facility was designed in 1917 and enlarged in 1918 by architect Wallace W. DeLong. From the 1960s to the early 1980s, Pierce was primarily known for building custom bodies on commercial and other manufacturer's custom chassis and was considered an original equipment manufacturer (OEM). In 1996, Pierce was wholly acquired by Oshkosh Corporation.\n\nIn September 2021, Pierce acquired an ownership interest in fire engine manufacturer Boise Mobile Equipment (BME) of Boise, Idaho.\n\n## Pierce-Arrow\n\n[edit] [...] Throughout the years, Pierce has had partnerships with various other manufacturers, notably when it came to aerial devices (it now designs and builds all its own aerial devices in-house). Such aerial manufacturers included Snorkel, Pitman, Aerial Innovations (AI), Ladder Towers Incorporated (LTI), Smeal, Bronto Skylift and Nova Quintech (whose assets Pierce/Oshkosh acquired in 1997). In addition to its main facilities in Wisconsin, it also has facilities in Bradenton, Florida. The Florida facility is a manufacturing site for the custom Saber chassis and Responder line of apparatus. Currently (December 4, 2017) Pierce is the largest manufacturer of firefighting apparatus in the United States.[citation needed] End-users are represented across a larger majority of the planet, including"
