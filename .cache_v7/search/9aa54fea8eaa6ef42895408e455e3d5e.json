      "snippet": "AI Summary by Glean\n\n Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines large language models and external data sources to deliver accurate and relevant responses, significantly reducing issues related to factual accuracy in AI-generated content.\n Key advantages of RAG include improved accuracy by grounding outputs in retrieved content, the ability to produce personalized responses, real-time adaptability to new information without model retraining, and enhanced scalability for complex knowledge repositories.\n Practical applications of RAG span various sectors, including customer support chatbots, content generation, enterprise Q&A systems, healthcare decision support, financial compliance, legal research, and AI assistants, improving workflows and productivity across organizations. [...] Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is changing the way enterprises access and apply knowledge. By combining large language models with external data sources, RAG enables AI to deliver accurate, relevant responses that reflect the latest information — not just what's embedded in its training data.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explain how RAG works, explore key benefits, and walk through seven real-world use cases across customer service, content creation, healthcare, and more.\n\n## What is retrieval-augmented generation? [...] It also supports continued learning by surfacing new findings relevant to a physician’s area of practice — helping practitioners stay informed without wading through mountains of publications.\n\n### 5. Financial services and compliance\n\nFinancial teams use RAG to navigate regulatory changes, analyze transaction histories, and support internal audits. AI systems can retrieve and contextualize compliance guidelines or legal interpretations, reducing the time needed to respond to internal or external inquiries.\n\nRAG also helps spot inconsistencies or unusual patterns by combining real-time data with retrieved documentation, providing a more complete picture for risk assessment.\n\n### 6.

      "snippet": "A paper by the Boston Consulting Group’s BCG Platinion division makes the case clearly. Entitled “Maximizing Business Insights with Retrieval Augmented Generation: How LLMs enhance enterprise question answering,” the paper explains that “GenAI has been known to exhibit highly realistic hallucinated data in its responses when it is not accompanied by factual context. Integration with existing enterprise data can mitigate these hallucinations by providing the necessary context for factual question answering.” [...] Request a Demo\n\nRequest a Demo\n\n# The Case for Using Retrieval Augmented Generation in Generative AI Applications within the Enterprise\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nMay 5, 2024\n\nMay 5, 2024\n\nThere is growing recognition across the business world that the technique known as “retrieval augmented generation” (RAG) is foundational to the effective use of generative AI (GenAI) within enterprise applications.\n\nHow retrieval augmented generation combats GenAI “hallucination” [...] Northern Light rides the retrieval augmented generation train\n\nNorthern Light wholeheartedly agrees with BCG’s views on the power and necessity of retrieval augmented generation for enterprise GenAI applications. That’s why our SinglePoint™ enterprise knowledge management platform for market and competitive intelligence employs RAG in its embedded question answering feature."
