Mr. Dong’s testimony began at 2:30 pm. - 4 - 7. Mr. Dong has done his best, under significant pressure, to share with the Commission his recollection of events that occurred between three and five years ago. As Mr. Dong went through the process of investigating the long series of allegations made about him in the media and later preparing for his initial interview, he made general inquiries with his campaign team to reassure himself that his campaign had complied with the rules, and honed in more closely on some allegations.3 Importantly, the February 25, 2023 article in Global News made a wide range of allegations relating to [...] in Global News made a wide range of allegations relating to Mr. Dong, including on the following topics:4 (a) Mr. Dong’s alleged knowing involvement in China’s election interference networks and alleged support from the PRC in 2019; (b) The allegedly suspicious manner in which Geng Tan, the previous MP for Don Valley North, stepped down; (c) CSIS allegedly “urging” the Prime Minister’s team to rescind Mr. Dong’s candidacy; (d) Mr. Dong’s allegedly “close” relationship with the consulate in Toronto; (e) Mr. Dong’s allegedly “close” relationship with Michael Chan; (f) Mr. Chan’s alleged “campaign” to orchestrate Tan’s ouster and persuade the Prime Minister’s aides to back Mr. Dong; (g) Mr. Chan’s alleged secret provision of information to the PRC; (h) CSIS’s alleged concerns about the [...] For national security confidentiality reasons, Mr. Clow and the Prime Minister were barred from making clear public statements exonerating Mr. Dong until this inquiry.83 D. Conclusion: the devastating media reporting about Mr. Dong requires correction 47. After over a year of being told by the media that Han Dong was a witting affiliate of the PRC’s foreign interference efforts who advocated for the delayed release of the Two Michaels, the public has finally heard evidence that these media allegations against Mr. Dong are false. Witnesses at the Stage 1 hearings have made this clear: (a) Mr. Clow described the reporting about the Two Michaels allegation as “explosive” and “wrong”.84 (b) Minister Blair stated that the intelligence, and CSIS officials themselves, did not indicate that Mr."

Falun Gong has its global headquarters in Dragon Springs, a 173-hectare (427-acre) compound in Deerpark, New York, United States, near the residence of Li. [...] In July 1999, the government of China implemented a ban on Falun Gong, categorizing it as an \"illegal organization\". Mass arrests, widespread torture and abuses followed. In 2008, U.S. government reports cited estimates that as much as half of China's labor camp population was made up of Falun Gong practitioners. In 2009, human rights groups estimated that at least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners had died from persecution by that time.

These principles have been repeated by Falun Gong members to outsiders as a tactic for evading deeper inquiry, and followers have been instructed by Li to lie about the practice.: 6 Together these principles are regarded as the fundamental nature of the cosmos, the criteria for differentiating right from wrong, and are held to be the highest manifestations of the Tao.
