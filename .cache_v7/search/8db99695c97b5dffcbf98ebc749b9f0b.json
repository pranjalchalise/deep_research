      "snippet": "To assume a brace position or crash position is an instruction that can be given to prepare for a crash, such as on an aircraft; the instruction to \"Brace for impact!\" or \"Brace! Brace!\" is often given if the aircraft must make an emergency landing on land or water. There are many different ways to adopt the brace position, with many countries adopting their own version based on research performed by their own aviation authority or that of other countries. The most common in passenger airliners being the forward-facing seat version, in which the person bracing places their head against or as close as possible to the surface it is likely to strike (and in the process bending over to some degree), placing their feet firmly on the floor, and their hands either on their head or the seat in [...] A 2015 study by the Federal Aviation Administration has concluded that brace positions, particularly the forward-facing seat position, significantly reduce the risk of head and neck injuries in impacts. When Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751 crashed in 1991, all passengers aboard survived; a \"significant factor\" to this outcome was the passengers' universal adoption of the brace position. During the \"Miracle on the Hudson\" emergency water landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in 2009, the pilot warned \"Brace for impact\" and flight attendants chanted \"Brace! Brace! Brace! Heads down! Stay down!\" All 155 people on board survived with no life-threatening injuries. In a press interview, one of the surviving crew members of the LaMia Flight 2933 crash in 2016 said that he had survived because he [...] There is also a third brace position for flight attendants, the \"normal\" or \"semi\" brace position. This is adopted by the attendant for every take-off and landing; it provides them with protection from any sudden emergencies and allows them to adopt the full brace position quickly should they need to. The only difference between the normal brace and the full brace position is that the attendants will either fold their arms across their stomach or immobilize them by placing their hands under their thighs with the palms up. This position forms part of every flight attendant's sixty second review – a technique adopted by airlines whereby the attendant will go over various factors in their head during the take-off and landing sequence.
