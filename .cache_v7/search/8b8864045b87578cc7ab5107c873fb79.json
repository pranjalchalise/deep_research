Detailed implementation steps include content processing, embedding using OpenAI embeddings, storage and retrieval using Faiss, and query handling using Mistral 7B. This involves breaking down PDF and CSV content into chunks, embedding them, and utilizing advanced algorithms for efficient data retrieval and visualization. Findings/Result: The fine-tuned Mistral 7B model significantly enhances data extraction speed compared to traditional models like Llama. Users can effectively query and extract specific information from PDFs and CSVs using natural language, facilitated by advanced AI models.

      "snippet": "3. Custom agents built on LangChain and LangGraph are also popular.\n\nA third, distinct cluster of answers pointed to custom agents, with many respondents building on LangChain and LangGraph. Respondents described internal agents for things like QA testing, internal knowledge-base search, SQL/text-to-SQL, demand planning, customer support, and workflow automation.\n\nA meaningful minority also noted that they don’t yet use agents beyond LLM chat or coding assistance, underscoring that while agent usage is widespread, broader “agentic everything” is still in its early innings.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe insights from this report were aggregated from a public survey that we ran for 2 weeks from Nov 18th-Dec 2nd, 2025. We received 1340 responses. Here’s some demographic data:\n\nTop 5 industries: [...] ‍\n\nWhat changes at scale?\n\nAmong organizations with 10k+ employees, internal productivity is the top use case (26.8%), with customer service (24.7%) and research & data analysis (22.2%) close behind. Larger enterprises may tend to focus first on driving efficiency across internal teams before, or alongside, deploying agents directly to end users.\n\n‍\n\n### Biggest barriers to production\n\nQuality remains the biggest barrier to production, consistent with last year’s findings. This year, one third of respondents cited quality as their primary blocker. This encompasses accuracy, relevance, consistency, and an agent’s ability to maintain the right tone and adhere to brand or policy guidelines.\n\nImage 11 [...] ‍\n\n### Observability for agents\n\nThe ability to trace through multi-step reasoning chains and tool calls has become _table stakes_ for agents. 89% of organizations have implemented some form of observability for their agents, and 62% have detailed tracing that allows them to inspect individual agent steps and tool calls.\n\nImage 13\n\nAdoption is even higher among respondents who already have agents in production:94% have some form of observability in place, and 71.5% have full tracing capabilities. This speaks to a fundamental truth of agent engineering: without visibility into how an agent reasons and acts, teams can’t reliably debug failures, optimize performance, or build trust with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nImage 14_%402x.png)\n\n### Evaluation and testing for agents"

This suggests that tech companies may be further along in building reliable agents, as controls are needed for high-quality experiences.\n\nNumber of methods used for controls or guardrails\n\nImage 25: Number of methods used for controls of guardrails\n\n### Barriers and challenges to getting agents into production"

      "snippet": "Weekly Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the Research Rundown\n\n## Summary\n\nLangChain is an open-source framework that streamlines the development of LLM-based applications by offering standardized component interfaces, flexible orchestration, and a rich ecosystem of integrations. Its products, including LangGraph and LangSmith, help developers go from prototype to production more easily. Despite intense competition from major cloud providers and specialized startups, LangChain’s open-source community advantage and rapid innovation have propelled it to a significant position in the space with the opportunity to expand its customer base.\n\n\\Contrary is an investor in Ramp through one or more affiliates.\n\nImportant Disclosures [...] ### Deepening Enterprise Integration\n\nWith a growing) enterprise customer base (e.g., Morningstar, Boston Consulting Group, and collaborations with Microsoft), there’s a clear opportunity to offer more enterprise-grade features. Research from IBM shows that while there is growth in enterprise adoption due to widespread deployment by early adopters, barriers keep 40% in the exploration and experimentation phases. The top barriers preventing deployment include limited AI skills and expertise (33%)), too much data complexity (25%)), and ethical concerns (23%)). [...] In October 2024, LangChain announced support for long-term memory in LangGraph. Previously, checkpointers provided only “short-term memory,” limiting an agent’s ability to learn across multiple conversations. With the introduction of cross-thread memory, LangGraph now enables agents to recall information from past conversations. This relies on a persistent document store where developers can put, get, and search for historical data, allowing agents to improve over time based on user feedback and preferences."
