      "snippet": "### Key Takeaways\n\n## Current Trends in Machine Learning\n\nAs machine learning continues to evolve, several trends have emerged that are shaping its trajectory. One prominent trend is the increasing adoption of deep learning techniques, which utilize neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex data. This approach has proven particularly effective in areas such as image and speech recognition, where traditional algorithms often fall short. [...] In the future, machine learning is expected to continue to advance in areas such as interpretability and explainability, ethical and responsible AI, federated learning, and the integration of machine learning with other emerging technologies such as quantum computing and edge computing. Additionally, there is a growing focus on democratizing machine learning and making it more accessible to non-experts.\n\nCopyright © Business Analytics Institute. [...] Today, machine learning is not just a theoretical construct but a practical tool that organizations utilize to enhance decision-making processes, optimize operations, and create innovative products and services. As society continues to embrace digital transformation, understanding machine learning becomes increasingly essential for both individuals and businesses alike.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n## Current Trends in Machine Learning"

      "snippet": "As ML evolves, we will likely see growth in other technologies like augmented reality and quantum computing. “Machine learning models can generate 3D objects for apps and other uses in augmented reality,” Luís Fernando Torres wrote. In addition, ML will play a role in improved facial recognition technology and interactions with generative AI.\n\n## Machine learning and security — the good and bad\n\nAs mentioned earlier, ML benefits your overall cybersecurity program by automating what were once cumbersome manual tasks. It can find threats that are otherwise missed and can cut down on false positives. [...] ## New trends in machine learning\n\nAs AI continues to advance, so does ML, and one of the most anticipated improvements to ML in 2024 will be no-code machine learning. No-code ML relies heavily on behavioral data and plain English to get results. Instead of complicated coding language, analysts will be able to ask a question or create a command to get a report. One of the biggest benefits of no-code ML is that it allows companies of all sizes to implement ML and AI into their networks without the need to hire data analysts and engineers. The downfall is that this type of ML technology is limited and won’t be able to do deep-dive predictive analysis.\n\nUnsupervised and reinforcement ML are both expected to expand in the coming year, in part because of no-code ML. [...] # AI trends: A closer look at machine learning’s role\n\nTech support team brainstorming\n\n## Authors\n\nWriter\n\n## \n\nThe hottest technology right now is AI — more specifically, generative AI. The trend is so popular that every conference and webinar speaker feels obligated to mention some form of AI, no matter their field.\n\nThe innovations and risks that AI offers are both exciting and frightening. However, the heavy focus on this technology overshadows an important component of artificial intelligence: machine learning (ML)."

      "snippet": "However, AI acceptability in the workplace is currently mixed. While 85% of leaders and 78% of managers responding to consultancy BCG's \"AI at Work 2025\" survey use generative AI (GenAI) in their regular work, just 51% of frontline employees reported using GenAI in 2025, down slightly from the previous year.\n\nAI confidence is rising and concerns are easing, but further adoption of AI in the workplace will depend heavily on business leadership support, tools well-suited to perform tasks and thorough training. A well-considered path toward employee reskilling to smooth AI adoption and reposition employees displaced by AI can also help alleviate AI concerns and bolster adoption in 2026.\n\n## 10. Businesses set to embrace 'invisible AI' [...] Agentic AI will continue to improve in performance and accuracy, offer highly tailored agents for specific industry verticals, known as vertical AI agents, and provide increasingly capable integrations that enable agents to access broader assortments of data sources, applications and systems.\n\n## 2. Standardization comes to AI IQ measurements\n\nCurrently, the AI industry lacks an industry standard for benchmarking and comparing enterprise AI systems. Some common benchmarks exist, including GLUE, SQuAD, and RACE, but they only capture limited cross-sections of AI capabilities and can't be compared side by side. [...] Global business is fully committed to AI growth. A report from Grand View Research noted that the global AI market, estimated at U.S. $279 billion in 2024, is expected to reach nearly $3.5 trillion in 2033. Tech giants are investing heavily in R&D, driving market adoption across vertical industries.\n\nBut the AI evolution is fraught with growing pains. The enormous potential for productivity is tempered by concerns over security, accuracy, performance, regulatory compliance, and human pushback. The sense of urgency to adopt AI can overwhelm an organization's capabilities, possibly placing the businesses and their customers at risk. Technology leaders, regulators and legislators are struggling to adapt to the rapidly changing AI landscape."

      "snippet": "“The basic idea of machine learning is, it’s a lot easier to collect data than to collect understanding,” Ramakrishnan said. For example, it’s easier to provide a machine learning program with thousands of photos of animals and tell it which ones depict cats and which depict dogs, as opposed to trying to teach a program all the complicated ways a cat can be distinguished from a dog. Feeding the program labeled data helps it learn how to tell the difference between the two on its own.\n\nMachine learning “makes decisions that generalize patterns that we would not have found otherwise,” Gupta said. “It’s as good as the data and the models that we have.” [...] By\n\nLess than five years ago, machine learning was one of the predominant ways businesses were using artificial intelligence. In April 2021, we called machine learning a “pervasive and powerful form of AI … changing every industry.”\n\nBut after ChatGPT-3.5 was released in 2022, many organizations shifted focus to a subfield of AI, generative AI, which can be used to create new content. Generative AI is machine learning (more on that below).\n\nTraditional machine learning is now an established technology in many organizations, and today leading firms are focusing on use cases for generative AI. In a 2024 survey of senior data leaders,  64% of respondents said that generative AI has the potential to be the most transformative technology in a generation. [...] ## When traditional machine learning is the better option\n\nIn some cases, though, machine learning is still the best option. Those situations could include:\n\nWhen you have privacy concerns.You must exercise caution when feeding proprietary, sensitive, or confidential information into LLMs, because there is the potential for data leaks. And while it is possible to build your own private models, that requires specialist technical skills that may not be easily available in your organization. In these situations, you might want to stick to “the old-fashioned way,” Ramakrishnan said."
