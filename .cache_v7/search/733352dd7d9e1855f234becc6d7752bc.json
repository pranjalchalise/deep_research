      "snippet": "## Listening to feedback\n\nAs the size of the React community has grown, so has the amount of feedback. Some of that feedback is good, some bad, but in both cases community members are taking time to share how they feel about a piece of technology. That’s a gift, even if there is a signal/noise filter that needs to be applied to some percentage.\n\nNow, if we take the most pessimistic view, you could argue: Lee, none of that community management stuff matters. Clearly React continues to grow and get more popular, even without the React team being active in community discussions. They built a great tool and that’s all that matters. Why waste time on all of those discussions? They know the right thing to build and all of that feedback is just noise. [...] My call to action for anyone in the React community today, and hoping to grow with it over time, is the following: remember there are humans working on the software, and they want to be treated with kindness and respect just like you. Remember that OSS is a gift and you are not entitled to make demands without putting any energy forward yourself. And above all else, be the optimistic change you want to see in the world.\n\n#### Discussion about this post\n\nJoel Cipriano\n\nDec 23\n\nThank you for everything, Lee! I’ll miss you on this side of the community.\n\nShare\n\nWill G.\n\nDec 14\n\nLove this!\n\nReplyShare\n\n2 more comments...\n\nNo posts\n\n### Ready for more?\n\n© 2026 Lee Robinson · Privacy ∙ Terms ∙ Collection notice\n\nStart your SubstackGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture [...] Ideas are fragile. I’m sure the React team felt like everyone would have strong opinions about RSC and the API design, and that led them to be more reserved in what they shared. Plus, they probably felt burned from sharing Suspense and Concurrent Features work early in the past. Sure, there were some React Labs posts every now and then, but RSC was developed quite differently than say Svelte adding async support. I see both sides.\n\nI wish I had been more vocal in the community about how RSC was being built. I did talk about this at conferences, which had calm, intentional, and thoughtful discussions with members of the React community."

[...] ### Are the surveys confidential?\n\nYes, the survey is confidential. We do not attach patient names to the survey because we want our patients to feel comfortable expressing their opinions. The survey administration process is handled exclusively by Press Ganey.\n\n### What questions are in the survey?\n\nLee Health deploys the Press Ganey Provider Loyalty survey to all patients with a qualified visit. These confidential surveys ask questions about the encounter with the provider, nurses, and other offices staff, as well as aspects of the office visit. We also solicit open-ended comments about the visit.\n\n### What do we do with the survey responses?"
