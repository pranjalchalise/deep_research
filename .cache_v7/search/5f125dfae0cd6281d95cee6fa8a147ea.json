As the population of older men continues to grow, understanding how testosterone deficiency intersects with aging-related health changes is increasingly important. This study will assess quality of life and key health markers—including cardiovascular parameters, body composition, strength-related measures, and inflammation—while also exploring a simplified once-daily dosing regimen. This research reflects Marius Pharmaceuticals’ ongoing commitment to advancing evidence-based insights in men’s health and supporting clinicians in caring for patients across all stages"
