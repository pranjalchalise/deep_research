      "snippet": "In addition to text-based datasets, you can use image datasets. For example, the Musculoskeletal Radiographs (MURA) dataset, which is a comprehensive database of multi-view radiographic images of bones. Use such image datasets to experiment with diagnostic assessment through medical image decoding techniques. These decoding techniques are crucial for early diagnosis of diseases, such as musculoskeletal diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and osteoporosis. By fine-tuning vision and language foundation models on the medical image dataset, you can detect of abnormalities in diagnostic images. This helps the system provide clinicians with early and accurate diagnostic insights. By using image and text datasets, you can create an AI-driven healthcare application that is capable of processing [...] The diagram shows the following workflow:\n\n1. A user submits a question to Amazon Bedrock and the LangChain agent.\n2. The Amazon Bedrock foundation model uses the Neptune schema, which is provided by the LangChain agent, to generate a query for the user's question.\n3. The LangChain agent runs the query against the Amazon Neptune medical knowledge graph.\n4. The LangChain agent sends the retrieved context to the Amazon Bedrock foundation model.\n5. The Amazon Bedrock foundation model uses the retrieved context to generate an answer to the user's question.\n\n## Step 4: Creating a knowledge base of real-time, descriptive data [...] 1. The user submits a question to the Amazon Bedrock agent.\n2. The Amazon Bedrock agent passes the question and input filter variables to the Amazon Bedrock action groups. These action groups contain an AWS Lambda function that interacts with the Amazon SageMaker AI text embedding endpoint and the Amazon Neptune medical knowledge graph.\n3. The Lambda function integrates with the SageMaker AI text embedding endpoint to perform a semantic search within the openCypher query. It converts the natural language query into an openCypher query by using underlying LangChain agents.\n4. The Lambda function queries the Neptune medical knowledge graph for the correct dataset and receives the output from the Neptune medical knowledge graph."

A LangChain ReAct agent analyzes the user's intent, formulates a structured plan for execution, and selects the most relevant retrieval tools. The system queries a previous questions cache and checks for similar queries based on key attributes, such as patient ID, medical condition, and visit date. If a highly similar Multi-retriever RAG design 45 AWS Prescriptive Guidance Creating Retrieval Augmented Generation solutions on AWS for healthcare question is found, the corresponding answer is retrieved directly. Otherwise, the agent executes the appropriate retriever. For retrieving patient-centric information, such as treatment history, [...] Solution overview AI can empower doctors and clinicians by synthesizing patient data and medical knowledge to provide valuable insights. This Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution is a medical intelligence engine that consumes a comprehensive set of patient data and knowledge from millions of clinical interactions. It harnesses the power of generative AI to create evidence-based insights for improved patient care. It is designed to enhance the clinical workﬂows, reduce errors, and improve patient outcomes.\nThe solution includes an automated image-processing capability that is powered by LLMs. This capability reduces the amount of time that medical personnel must spend manually searching for similar diagnostic images and analyzing diagnostic results."
