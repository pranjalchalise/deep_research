Published by Elsevier Inc. [...] Age-associated osteoporosis (AAOP) poses a significant health burden, characterized by increased fracture risk due to declining bone mass and strength. Effective prevention and early treatment strategies are crucial to mitigate the disease burden and the associated healthcare costs. Current therapeutic approaches effectively target the individual contributing factors to AAOP. Nonetheless, the management of AAOP is complicated by the multitude of variables that affect its development. Main intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to AAOP risk are reviewed here, including mechanical unloading, nutrient deficiency, hormonal disbalance, disrupted metabolism, cognitive decline, inflammation and circadian disruption. Furthermore, it is discussed how these can be targeted for prevention and [...] is discussed how these can be targeted for prevention and treatment. Although valuable as individual targets for intervention, the interconnectedness of these risk factors result in a unique etiology for every patient. Acknowledgement of the multifaceted nature of AAOP will enable the development of more effective and sustainable management strategies, based on a holistic, patient-centered approach."

Assessment of fracture risk using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry represents the first diagnostic step; its predictive value can be improved by applying specific adjustments such as the trabecular bone score. This Review highlights how the bone microenvironment responds to supraphysiological glucocorticoid concentrations, and discusses the basis for skeletal fragility and fractures. We review the use and limitations of current and emerging imaging technologies and prediction tools, and discuss bone-forming and antiresorptive treatment strategies and their use to prevent and treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. [...] ## Cited by (0)\n\n\\\n:   Contributed equally\n\n© 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. [...] Despite advances in targeted therapies, treatment with glucocorticoids remains a mainstay in the management of various immune-mediated diseases. High cumulative doses of exogenous glucocorticoids lead to a spectrum of side-effects, in particular increased fracture risk. Fragility fractures might result in immobility, frequent admission to hospitals, and loss of quality of life. Glucocorticoid excess impairs bone microarchitecture and bone strength and can cause multiple vertebral fractures. Fracture risk at other skeletal sites is also enhanced and triggered by an increased risk for falls. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis results from direct suppression of osteoblast and osteocyte function, a transient stimulation of osteoclast formation and activity, catabolic effects on bone matrix"
