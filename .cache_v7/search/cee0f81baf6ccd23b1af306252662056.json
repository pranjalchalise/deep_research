Coming soon: a LlamaIndex-based RAG tutorial series covering embedding fine-tuning, knowledge base setup, advanced retrieval, and evaluation.  Check out the full guide and let’s build smarter agents together! | [...] | Discussion Type General Discussion Content In the fast-evolving world of AI, agent development is booming, and LangChain + LangGraph are leading platforms driving massive interest. However, existing video tutorials often lack depth. To bridge this gap, I've created an in-depth documentation project.    This guide dives deep into building intelligent agents by leveraging the strengths of LangChain and LangGraph. It combines my hands-on experience with detailed tutorials on core components, rooted in official documentation. Beyond technical knowledge, it includes my insights and complete, practical code examples to help you master agent development.  The document is actively updated, currently covering multi-agent architectures, with upcoming sections on callback mechanisms,"

Such integration could pave the way for a truly open Agent Registry, much like how ONNX standardized model exchange across deep learning frameworks.\n\n  \n\n### Related topics [...] ### Related topics\n\nTopic list, column headers with buttons are sortable.\n\n| Topic | Replies | Views | Activity |\n| Feature Request: Native Support for A2A Protocol (Remote Agents as Sub-Graphs)  LangGraph  python-help,ambient-agents-with- | 2 | 657 | 13d |\n| Native Support for A2A Protocol  LangGraph  python-help,self-hosted | 0 | 631 | Aug 2025 |\n| Deep Agents in Cloud  LangGraph  python-help,intro-to-langgraph,self-hosted,guidelines | 0 | 79 | Oct 2025 |\n| Langgraph FastAPI Example to use with Agent Chat Ui  LangGraph  python-help,self-hosted | 2 | 147 | 18d |\n| A2A protocol using LangChain and LangGraph  LangGraph  python-help,ambient-agents-with- | 3 | 4.3k | Jul 2025 |"

I can’t find many resources on it online and the video example is pretty light. Anyone have any resources or examples for me?\n\n8 days later\n\n## post by Zugunruhekami on Jul 27, 2025\n\nZugunruhekami\n\nJul 2025\n\nSame question here. And also wonder if there is a way to connect and use RemoteGraph (as sub-graph in a main graph) without using LangGraph Platform API keys?\n\n1 month later\n\n## post by MartijnLeplae on Sep 5, 2025\n\nMartijnLeplae\n\nSep 2025\n\nI think this LangGraph Open Agents Platform project is a really nice example: .\n\nThe supervisor shows how to use RemoteGraph as well as custom authentication.\n\n  \n\n### Related topics"

[...] Graph Structure: It employs a graph-like structure with nodes and edges, enabling developers to design flexible, non-linear workflows that accommodate branches and loops. It mirrors complex decision-making processes resembling the way neural pathways might work.\n State Management: LangGraph offers built-in tools for state persistence and error recovery, simplifying the maintenance of contextual data across various stages within an application. It can effectively switch between short-term and long-term memory, enhancing interaction quality thanks to such tools as Zep.\n Tool Integration: With LangGraph, LLM agents can easily collaborate with external services or databases to fetch real-world data, improving the functionality and responsiveness of your applications."
