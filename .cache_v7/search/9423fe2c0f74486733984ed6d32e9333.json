Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War.

      "snippet": "Marius has a conflicted attitude towards religion and spirituality, as he is the keeper of the shrine of Those Who Must Be Kept. Marius does not believe in divine power, and blames religious ideas for his own unwilling transformation into a vampire, which often brings him into conflict with other vampires as Christianity and the Children of Satan emerge in Europe. His lover Pandora accuses him of having \"made a religion out of reason.\"\n\n## Biography[]\n\n### Early Life[]\n\nMarius was a citizen of the Roman Gallic city of Massilia, born in approximately 30 BCE. He was the illegitimate child of a Keltoi woman from the land of Gaul and a wealthy Roman. [...] Marius de Romanus is an ancient vampire of Roman origin first introduced in The Vampire Lestat. Transformed into a vampire near beginning of the first century, he becomes the guardian of Those Who Must Be Kept for nearly two thousand years. Marius plays an important role in the timeline of The Vampire Chronicles, as he is viewed by Lestat as a mentor figure, is Armand's and Pandora's maker, and is the central figure of his own autobiography, Blood and Gold.\n\n## Contents\n\n 1 Physical Appearance\n 2 Personality\n 3 Biography\n  + 3.1 Early Life\n  + 3.2 Life As a Vampire\n 4 In Adaptations\n 5 Gallery\n\n## Physical Appearance[] [...] ## Personality[]\n\nMarius is an exceptionally sagacious, wise and optimistic vampire. He loves to read and to write, and sees himself as a historian and a continual observer of the history of the human race. Marius's interests include all manner of intellectual and artistic pursuits, including filmmaking, writing, and most notably, painting. Marius is obsessed with the art created by humans, but is distraught by his inability to create art that is not somewhat unnatural due to his vampiric nature. Marius is frequently torn between his desire to live among humans and the limitations of his ability to do so. Despite his age, he prefers to move and act like a human in situations where he could otherwise use his vampiric powers."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship"

      "snippet": "Ancient sources suggest that Marius was pre-destined, through the visions of a seer, to be Consul of Rome seven times. Not only would this prove true, but he would eventually be hailed as the third founder of Rome, and its savior.\n\nMilitary glory and personal ambition drove Marius straight to the top of the Roman system, but perhaps even more importantly, the man and his legacy would have a profound impact on the life of his nephew, Gaius Julius Caesar.\n\nAs a youth, Marius may have used his modest family influence to join the Republican legions as a junior officer, or may have risen from the ranks. It is difficult to determine exactly, but it is known that he spent his early career in Hispania under Scipio Aemilianus, grandson of Scipio Africanus.

Contrary to popular belief, the Marius clan was influential locally, and maintained some limited client relationships with those in Rome.\n\nOf equestrian but outside roots, Marius would find his early attempts to climb the Roman social and political ladder difficult at best. Using the legion as his route to fame, fortune and power, he would become among the most influential men of his day, and the history of Rome. [...] Immediately devoid of political support from the social elite, Marius was unsuccessful in several attempts to be elected as an Aedile. His persistence, and disregard for his new man status, made him several enemies, but he would persevere. In 115 BC, he was elected Praetor, but was bogged down by politically motivated challenges to his election.\n\nAfter a year of service in Rome, Marius was assigned the province of Hispania Ulterior for his Propraetorship. While a seemingly inglorious position, he served well, and his military experience played a significant role."

The younger Marius reached the estate of Mucius, but as he was getting supplies and packing them up, day overtook him and he did not altogether escape the vigilance of his enemies; for some horsemen came riding towards the place, moved by suspicion. 7 When the overseer of the farm saw them coming, he hid Marius in a waggon loaded with beans, yoked up his oxen, and met the horsemen as he was driving the waggon to the city. In this way young Marius was conveyed to the house of his wife, where he got what he wanted, and then by night came to the sea, boarded a ship that was bound for Africa, and crossed over.

Perhaps, too, he was afraid of the soldiers, who were drawn up and ready, in case Catulus were deprived of his honour, to prevent Marius also from celebrating a triumph. [...] The Roman governor of Africa at this time was Sextilius, a man who had received neither good nor ill at the hands of Marius, but whom, as it was expected, pity alone would move to give him aid. Hardly, however, had Marius landed with a few companions, p577when an official met him, stood directly in front of him, and said: \"Sextilius the governor forbids thee, Marius, to set foot in Africa; and if thou disobeyest, he declares that he will uphold the decrees of the senate and treat thee as an enemy of Rome.\" 4 When he heard this, Marius was rendered speechless by grief and indignation, and for a long time kept quiet, looking sternly at the official. Then, when asked by him what he had to say, and what answer he would make to the governor, he answered with a deep groan: \"Tell him, then, that"
