      "snippet": "Couched in terms of their software engineer job, John shares the details of a recent mission. A flashback shows that the two of them were spying on a group of African-American targets on a rooftop. John asked Jane to let him take the lead and therefore infiltrated the group, striking up a conversation with them. However, in the therapy session, Jane complains that John was taking forever and he says that the real problem is that she just didn't like that he was doing so well without her. The therapist asks if he feels this bothers Jane, and he tells her that he knows it does, that he was bonding with black people and thus had access in a way she never had, that it bothered her. She, however, argues that what he was really bonding with them over was sexism. She says that it's just how John [...] \"I-I trained her in a lot of ways.\"  \n \"You trained me?\"  \n \"Mm. You know, and if I'm being honest, I felt more comfortable in that role 'cause it-it felt like she was looking up to me. And I miss that.\"  \n - John Smith and Jane, \"Couples Therapy\"\n\n## Trivia[]\n\n When he and Jane are asked by others about their occupation, they claim to be software engineers or designers.\n\n## Gallery[]\n\nCategories\n\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted. [...] The therapist asks where else they're feeling misaligned and John tells her that it's kid stuff - that he wants them and Jane doesn't. When the therapist asks Jane what her reservations are about children, she says that it doesn't feel responsible in their line of work, claiming that software engineering is very stressful. She asks how it feels, living and working together and John calls it \"tricky.\" Jane is surprised by this answer, but therapist tells her it's why they're there, for this stuff to come out. John tells her that Jane's default is to be controlling of the situation and she asks if he can give an example."
