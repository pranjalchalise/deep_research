      "snippet": "## What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. By incorporating new and context-aware data, AI can generate more accurate, current and domain-specific responses.\n\nRAG is quickly becoming the go-to architecture for building enterprise-grade AI applications. According to recent surveys, over 60% of organizations are developing AI-powered retrieval tools to improve reliability, reduce hallucinations and personalize outputs using internal data. [...] Read now\n\n## How RAG works\n\nRAG enhances a language model’s output by injecting it with context-aware and real-time information retrieved from an external data source. When a user submits a query, the system first engages the retrieval model, which uses a vector database to identify and “retrieve” semantically similar documents, databases or other sources for relevant information. Once identified, it then combines those results with the original input prompt and sends it to a generative AI model, which synthesizes the new information into its own model.\n\nThis allows the LLM to produce more accurate, context-aware answers grounded in enterprise-specific or up-to-date data, rather than simply relying upon the model it was trained on. [...] ## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?  \nRAG is an AI architecture that strengthens LLMs by retrieving relevant documents and injecting them into the prompt. This enables more accurate, current and domain-specific responses without taking time to retrain the model.\n\nWhen should I use RAG instead of fine-tuning?  \nUse RAG when you want to incorporate dynamic data without the cost or complexity of fine-tuning. It is ideal for use cases where accurate and timely information is required."

      "snippet": "## What is RAG?\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a novel framework addressing limitations in traditional text generation models. While models like OpenAI’s GPT excel at generating coherent, context-aware text, they often struggle with factual accuracy or precise content control. RAG bridges this gap by integrating external knowledge bases with pre-trained large language models (LLMs). This synergistic approach allows LLMs to access factual information during generation, fostering more accurate and up-to-date content creation. The resulting versatility and effectiveness position RAG as a powerful tool for the future of NLP applications, from informative chatbots and precise machine translation to content creation that seamlessly blends creativity with factual accuracy. [...] ## RAG Ecosystem\n\nTher are further concepts and components to bundle RAG ecosystem , as depicted in Figure 5. emphasizeing RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from language models with extensive non-parameterized data from external knowledge bases, the evolution of RAG technologies and their application on many different tasks, three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modular RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over its predecessors, RAG’s technical integration with other AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\n\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs. However, training datasets are finite and limited to the information the AI developer can access—public domain works, internet articles, social media content and other publicly accessible data. [...] Standard LLMs source information from their training datasets. RAG adds an information retrieval component to the AI workflow, gathering relevant information and feeding that to the generative AI model to enhance response quality and utility.\n\nRAG systems follow a five-stage process:\n\n1. The user submits a prompt.\n2. The information retrieval model queries the knowledge base for relevant data.\n3. Relevant information is returned from the knowledge base to the integration layer.\n4. The RAG system engineers an augmented prompt to the LLM with enhanced context from the retrieved data.\n5. The LLM generates an output and returns an output to the user."
