      "snippet": "The argument over alleged racism is just the latest example of longrunning tensions between Musk and Khosla. The two began arguing in earnest online in 2024, when they traded a series of jabs over the election, development of artificial intelligence, immigration, the role of government in business and other topics. After then-President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the 2024 race for president, Khosla posted to X saying the Democratic Party should seek a moderate candidate for his replacement, and Musk instead encouraged him to support Donald Trump. Khosla replied it would be “hard for me to support someone with no values, lies, cheats, rapes, demeans women, hates immigrants like me.” Musk claimed Trump would \"promote individual freedoms over the heavy hand of government,\" to [...] Khosla didn’t respond to Musk’s post, but X users were quick to slam Musk's defense as a commonly used one to deflect accusations of prejudice. \"This response takes the ‘some of my best friends are... ‘ to an entirely different level, Elon style,\" one user posted, with another adding, \"When your ‘argument’ is just name-calling and slurs, you’ve already lost.\"\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

[...] The EU probe follows a similar one initiated by the U.K. watchdog Ofcom earlier this month. In the U.K., Musk faces a fine of up to 10% of X’s worldwide revenue or £18 million ($24.5 million), whichever is greater, if found to have breached the law. Malaysia and Indonesia have also blocked access to the Grok AI chatbot over deepfake concerns.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n### Box Office: 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' Remains No. 1 in Fifth Weekend as ‘28 Years Later: Bone Temple' Stumbles With $15 Million Holiday Debut\n\n### Korea Box Office: ‘Once We Were Us’ and ‘Avatar: Fire and Ash’ Tussle for Top Spot [...] ### Popular on Variety\n\n“Sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” said Henna Virkkunen, executive VP of tech sovereignty, security and democracy. “With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens — including those of women and children — as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen doubled down in a statement to Agence France-Presse, saying: “In Europe, we will not tolerate unthinkable behavior, such as digital undressing of women and children. It is simple — we will not hand over consent and child protection to tech companies to violate and monetize. The harm caused by illegal images is very real.”"
