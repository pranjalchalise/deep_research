      "snippet": "“He came from a world that had been in the making for centuries and really erupted into our consciousness at a particular time. Nobody was Bruce Lee before Bruce Lee,” Maeda says. “One of the points I’m making is that nobody could have been. The events, processes and forces in the world that made his global stardom possible didn’t all come together until the 1960s.\n\n“I think of Bruce Lee as emblematic of the course of history over the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. He should be remembered as a significant global and cultural figure,” he says. [...] “At the time, who was on TV? In reruns of Bonanza, Hop Sing was played for laughs and subservient,” Maeda says. “Bruce Lee was strong, heroic, frankly almost superhuman. That’s a powerful message to a kid who doesn’t see himself in popular culture in the rest of his life.”\n\nIn August, Maeda will return the favor to one of his childhood idols with the publication of Like Water: A Cultural History of Bruce Lee, a unique blend of biography and cultural history that explores Lee’s power as an inspiring symbol, enduring legacy and harbinger of our current, globalized world.

But whatever the ultimate resolution to this debate, it seems that there is an effort on the part of certain advertisers to retool and downplay Bruce Lee’s achievements in an effort to create a new moment of “revolution” in the current era. [...] Today is the 75th anniversary of Lee’s birth in San Francisco. Born in California and raised in Hong Kong before returning to the West Coast at the end of the 1950s, Lee had a profound effect on the worlds of film, popular culture and the martial arts. While many claims about his career are exaggerated (one should treat with a certain degree of suspicion any assertion that someone was the “first” to do anything) there can be no doubt as to his ultimate impact on the public perception of the martial arts in America, as well as their rapid spread and popularization in the post-1970 era. [...] Birthdays are also important times for looking to the future. There can be no doubt that Lee’s image has retained a remarkable grip on the public imagination. Decades after his death he still frequently appears on magazine covers and in video games. Books bearing his name (either as an author or in their title) are found in every bookstore with a martial arts section. And Lee’s impact on the realm of martial art films can still be detected with ease. Countless allusions to his more iconic fight sequences can be seen on both the big and small screen. Ninjas may come and go, but even in the age of MMA it seems that Bruce will always have a home on the cover of Black Belt magazine."

      "snippet": "Bruce Lee was the first actor to bridge East and West. He was from Hong Kong and the U.S. He understood how to speak to both audiences in a way that no one else ever had. Enter the Dragon was the first film co-produced in Hong Kong and Hollywood. This meant Asian landscapes and characters weren’t constructed by American filmmakers. More importantly, Chinese filmmakers had some control over how they appeared on screen. (Compare that to some of the decade’s more problematic depictions of Asian people, particularly films about the Vietnam War.) [...] There are so, so, so many avenues for researchers to explore Bruce Lee’s overwhelming influence on the action movie genre and on the ways marginalized people are represented in film, and how his influence contributed to a shift in the overall culture of the West. For this blog post, with great difficulty, we’ve had to limit ourselves but at the end of the article we’ve included a sample of the vast resources for further research or just for some fascinating reading.\n\n### Changing perceptions of Asians in the American psyche [...] With kung fu, anyone willing to do the training could be the hero. Unlike previous action stars who needed guns and other weapons, Lee showed that all a person needs to fight is their own body – an empowering message that appealed to working class audiences of every ethnic background. In Lee’s universe, Black, white and Asian martial artists worked together against the bad guys – and they didn’t need fancy James Bond gear or even the Duke’s six-guns to do it."

[...] When you consider Bruce Lee in music look no further than hip-hop and his name and image are used almost as frequently as an analogy and one of hip hops biggest names the Wu Tang Clan created there entire style after the Eastern Culture of martial arts.\n\nNo place on Earth is out of the reach of Lee’s Legacy, the most famous face of the NBA today Kobe Bryant is a die-hard Bruce fanatic, so much so that his latest line of sneakers was heavily inspired by a combination of Enter the Dragon and Game of Death colorways and the tiger claw scratch. [...] But easiest to spot for anyone with interest in the genre would be the many incantations of Bruce Lee imitators that arose after his much too early death in 1973. Actors, or but yet Bruce-impersonators like Bruce Li (Bronson Lee, Bruce Chen, Bruce Lai, Bruce Le, Bruce Lei, Bruce Lie, Bruce Liang (also known as Bruce Leung), Bruce Ly, Bruce Thai, Bruce K.A. Lea, Brute Lee, Myron Bruce Lee, Lee Bruce, and Dragon Lee all graced the covers of VHS films of little quality to cash in on the power of his image. Most famously Bruce Li was chosen as the actor to finish the scenes for Game of Death following Lee’s death before going on to film a laundry list of films such as Fist of Fury II, The Image of Bruce Lee, Fists of Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee’s Secret and many more following until the mid-80s."

The art has as its symbolic representation what we call Bruce Lee’s Core Symbol (see below) and uses as its main tenet: “Using no way as way; having no limitation as limitation.”\n\nThe term Jeet Kune Do was coined and put into use in 1967 by Bruce Lee in an attempt to put a name to his martial expression. Lee wrestled with putting a name to his art as he constantly veered away from any type of crystallization (and thereby limitation) of its essence, however, the simple need to refer to it in some concrete way won out and Jeet Kune Do was born.
