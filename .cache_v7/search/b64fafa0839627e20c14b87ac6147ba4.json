      "snippet": "As a journalist, I had the opportunity to interview John Smith, a senior software engineer at OpenAI, about his work and the exciting world of artificial intelligence.\n\nJohn shared with me some insights into his daily routine as a software engineer, including his responsibilities for leading the development of complex AI projects such as chatbot GPT-3 and mentoring junior team members. He also spoke about the potential impacts of AI on language and communication, and how it could potentially make it easier for people to communicate with each other and bridge language barriers. [...] John shared with us his thoughts on the development of GPT-3 and other AI projects at OpenAI, and the ways in which AI could potentially change the way we communicate and interact with each other. He also highlighted the importance of approaching the development and use of AI with caution and consideration for its potential impacts and consequences, and ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared and distributed fairly across society.\n\nOverall, it was a thought-provoking and illuminating conversation that gave us a deeper understanding of the dynamic and rapidly-evolving field of artificial intelligence. Thank you, John, for sharing your expertise and insights with us!\n\n## The Impact\n\nJohn Smith is an avatar in a role game created with Assistant, the last version of GPT-3 from Open AI. [...] ## Wrap up\n\nIn conclusion, it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to interview John Smith, a senior software engineer at OpenAI, about his work and the exciting world of artificial intelligence. Through our conversation, we gained valuable insights into the daily responsibilities and challenges of working in the field of AI, as well as the potential impacts of AI on language, communication, and the human race."

      "snippet": "Some observations from my ill-informed stumbling around in a technology I don't really understand: [...] I reduced Chromium CPU usage from mid-30s to mid-20s (as measured on the Linux box) by moving code out of the main animation loop that didn't need to be there - stuff that defined the geometry, pushed the texture through, etc.\n I still need to find a way to mentally keep track of the various different coordinate systems in use - vertex shader uses -1.0 to 1.0, fragment shader uses 0.0 to 1.0, plus also remembering the real pixels. (And not to mention that 2D canvas is inverted compared to WebGL canvas!) [...] There are no true 3D objects or particles, instead the code sets up 6 triangles that make up 3 rectangles, each of which fill the full WebGL canvas area. These form 3 parallax layers, which form the starfield(s) - with only minor tweaks, the number of layers could be increased, which would probably improve the believability of the effect a fair bit.\n The stars are rendered entirely in the fragment shader, using a pseudo-random algorithm based on the X&Y pixel position and the frame number. The increments to the frame number are what give the scrolling effect, and a speed value supplied via the vertex shader is what causes each layer to scroll at a different rate."
