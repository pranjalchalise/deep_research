      "snippet": "Bruce Lee's Fighting Method is a book of volumes covering Bruce Lee's martial arts abilities of the Jeet Kune Do movement. The book is available as a single hardcover volume or a series of four paperback volumes. The text describes Bruce Lee's Kung Fu fighting techniques, philosophy and training methods. This book was originally written in 1966 by Bruce Lee. However, Lee decided not to publish this work as he feared that instructors would use the fighting knowledge in this text to promote themselves. In 1978, after Bruce Lee's death, his widow Linda Lee Cadwell decided to make available the information on her husband's work. Lee's death changed the perspective of releasing the information that Bruce Lee himself had vacillated about. The book was published with the help of Mitoshi Uyehara.

      "snippet": "— Bruce Lee\n\nLee’s study of all aspects of physical training led him to experiment with different fitness modalities, including barbell training, isometrics, plyometrics, circuit training, running, and stretching.\n\nHis practice of these diverse modalities all had a single goal: becoming a better martial artist.\n\nWhile Lee only chose exercises that would help him improve as a fighter, because martial arts require the full spectrum of physical capabilities (strength, power, speed, endurance, and flexibility), Lee systematically trained all these capabilities; he didn’t specialize.\n\nBelow, we’ll look at the main components of his physical training:\n\n## Weightlifting [...] ## The Sources of Bruce Lee’s Physical Training Philosophy\n\nIn moving forward from the fight, Lee sought to develop a physical training system that emphasized “practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency” and drew from a wide range of training methods.\n\nWhile Jeet Kune Do sounds like a formal martial art style like Tae Kwon Do, Lee intended it to be “the style of no style” — a martial art that transcended formal rules and incorporated the best ideas from various disciplines.\n\nTo find these ideas, Lee became a devoted student of the art and science of physical training. [...] Lee incorporated the progressive overload principle into his running by increasing his speed or distance. He was also an early practitioner of the “heavy hands” method of aerobic activity and would hold light dumbbells or wear ankle weights while running.\n\nLee would sometimes supplement the running he did for cardiovascular health by cycling or jumping rope on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.\n\n## Stretching\n\nYou’ve likely seen pictures of Lee displaying his phenomenal flexibility with one of his high kicks. That flexibility came from his commitment to daily stretching. Upon rising and before he got out of bed, he would do his “Wake-Up Routine” — a set of six stretches and body activation exercises:"

      "snippet": "Lee performed one-hand push-ups using only the thumb and index finger.\n\nLee performed 50 reps of one-arm chin-ups.\n\nLee could cause a 300 lb (136.08 kg) bag to fly towards and thump the ceiling with a sidekick.\n\nThis is all just to establish that he was unusually strong. Anyway, my question is, how? What was different about his muscles that they were so efficient in terms of strength:mass? And were there any tradeoffs?\n\nThanks!\n\n(edited to fix broken link) [...] Thanks!\n\n(edited to fix broken link)\n\nEdit2: Wow this exploded overnight. Thanks for all of your contributions and effort. It seems much of the discussion is about the legitimacy of these feats, which I'm slightly disappointed by. I was hoping for some more insight into muscular structure and training techniques (like csmit244 provided, thanks!), and I mentioned that the stats were just to establish that he was unusually strong, which I think is undisputed. Anyway, I still appreciate all of the discussion.

Height 5'7.5\" (1.71m), Weight 140 lbs (64.4 kg) source in 1972, age 32, 1 year before he died.\n\nBut he was much stronger than any 140 lb guy you'll meet, and stronger than most people of any weight. Here are some of his feats, according to John Little, \"the only person who has ever been authorized to review the entirety of Lee's personal notes, sketches and reading annotations\" Wikipedia\n\nLee could take in one arm a 75 lb barbell from a standing position with the barbell held flush against his chest and slowly stick his arms out locking them, holding the barbell there for several seconds."
