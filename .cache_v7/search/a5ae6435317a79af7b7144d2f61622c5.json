      "title": "Ball Python Behavior: What Every Owner Needs to Know",
      "snippet": "A well-adjusted ball python is a result of consistent care, attentive observation, and understanding of its behavioral needs. Owners should prioritize creating an environment that mirrors the snake’s natural habitat. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and enclosure design must be optimized to ensure the python feels secure and comfortable. [...] ### 5. Continual Attempts to Escape\n\nRepeated escape attempts indicate dissatisfaction with the enclosure’s conditions. Inappropriate size, lack of security, or absence of proper hiding spaces can drive this behavior. Ball pythons are skilled escape artists and will exploit weak points in the enclosure, such as loose lids or gaps. Ensuring a secure and appropriately designed habitat is crucial to mitigating this issue.\n\nOwners must evaluate the specific circumstances surrounding these behaviors to determine their cause and make the necessary adjustments. Recognizing and addressing these issues promptly is critical for the snake’s health and overall quality of life.\n\n## Seasonal Changes in Ball Python Behavior [...] Ball pythons (Python regius) are native to the grasslands, savannas, and lightly forested areas of West and Central Africa. They thrive in warm climates with moderate humidity, typically using burrows or termite mounds for shelter. Understanding this natural habitat is essential for interpreting their behavior in captivity and replicating ideal environmental conditions to support their welfare."

      "snippet": "Most pythons are terrestrial to semiarboreal, and a few, such as the green tree python (Morelia viridis) of Australia and New Guinea, are strongly arboreal. Terrestrial pythons are regularly found near water and are proficient swimmers, but they hunt and eat almost exclusively on land. Larger pythons prey mainly on mammals and birds; smaller species also eat amphibians and reptiles. Pythons have good senses of smell and sight, and most can also detect heat. Pits lying between the lip scales have receptors that are sensitive to infrared radiation and enable pythons to “see” the heat shadow of mammals and birds even during the darkest night. Prey is captured by striking and biting, usually followed by constriction. When swallowing prey, pythons secrete a mucus that contains harmless trace [...] Eight species of genus Python live in sub-Saharan Africa and from India to southern China into Southeast Asia, including the Philippines and the Moluccas islands of Indonesia. Other related genera inhabit New Guinea and Australia. Some Australian pythons (genus Liasis) never grow much longer than one metre, but some pythons of Africa (P. sebae), India (P. molurus), Southeast Asia and Java (P. bivittatus), New Guinea (L. papuanus), and Australia (L. amethistinus) regularly exceed 3 metres (10 feet). Despite their large size, some of these species survive in urban and suburban areas, where their secretive habits and recognized value as rat catchers par excellence serve to protect them. The Burmese python (P. bivittatus) also occurs in large numbers in southern Florida in North America, [...] Pythons are egg layers (oviparous) rather than live-bearers (viviparous). Females of most, if not all, species coil around the eggs, and some actually brood them. Brooders select thermally stable nesting sites, then lay their eggs and coil around them so that the eggs are in contact only with the female’s body. When the air temperature begins to drop, she generates heat by shivering in a series of minuscule muscle contractions and thus maintains an elevated and fairly constant incubation temperature.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAnimal Group Names\n\n## Old world pythons"

      "snippet": "## HABITAT AND DIET\n\nPythons can be difficult to find and watch long enough to learn their habits. They are found in rainforests, grasslands and savannas, woodlands, swamps, rocky outcrops, desert sand hills, and shrub lands, depending on the species. Pythons may be active day or night, depending on species, habitat, and when prey is most active.\n\nMost pythons seek shelter in tree branches or hollows, among reeds, in rocky outcrops, or in abandoned mammal burrows. Two exceptions are the woma and the black-headed python, the only pythons known to create their own burrow by digging with the head and scooping out the dirt by curving their neck. Their jaws are countersunk, lower jaw fitting inside the upper jaw, which keeps dirt out of the snake’s mouth. [...] Pythons have predators. Small, young pythons may be attacked and eaten by a variety of birds, wild dogs and hyenas, large frogs, large insects and spiders, and even other snakes. But adult pythons are also at risk from birds of prey and even lions and leopards. The snakes are most vulnerable after a large meal, when they are less inclined to move quickly. If threatened, some pythons roll into a ball and tuck their head in the coils; others may try to escape, get into a striking, or “S”-shaped, position, or use their constricting power if grabbed.\n\n## HABITAT AND DIET [...] ## CONSERVATION\n\nMany people in Asia, Australia, and Africa live closer to pythons than they think, as the snakes often use backyards, basements, and roofs as their habitat. Pythons may also live on or near farms or gardens, where rodents are abundant. Some people appreciate the pest control pythons provide, but others consider the snakes to be the pests and kill them on sight. Pythons are often run over on purpose while sunning on or crossing a road. In Asia, pythons are killed for folk medicine uses and as a food source, and the larger pythons, particularly the Indian python, are killed for their beautiful patterned skin, which is used for clothing and apparel."

      "snippet": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected \"Garbage collection (computer science)\"). It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. [...] Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC \"ABC (programming language)\") programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba \"Amoeba (operating system)\") operating system. Python implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. (He [...] The Snek embedded computing language \"is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek.\" Snek is compatible with 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger microcontrollers that are compatible with MicroPython. Snek is an imperative language that (unlike Python) omits object-oriented programming. Snek supports only one numeric data type, which features 32-bit single precision (resembling JavaScript numbers, though smaller)."

While a relatively large amount of research has been done on this family, it is apparent that there is a strong bias towards captive-bred animals and not enough research on wild individuals. With the increasing anthropogenic pressures, this could lead to misinformed decisions in conservation efforts. We recommend that future work be conducted on these snakes in their natural environments to allow for informed decisions to be made for their [...] Globally, many snake species are declining because of anthropogenic factors such as changing land use, illegal killing, unsustainable harvesting and poaching. Many of the larger snake species are particularly affected. The family Pythonidae consists of 38 species over 11 genera − many of which are relatively large in size. We conducted a systematic literature search using two search engines and found 512 peer-reviewed publications on members of the Pythonidae family. Since the first publication in 1844, scientific research on the family has increased steadily, with a major increase since 2000. The majority of these papers were focused on single species (84.7 %) and focussed on snakes in captivity (60.1 %).
