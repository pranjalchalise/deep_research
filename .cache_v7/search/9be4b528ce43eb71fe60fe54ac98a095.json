      "snippet": "## What is React useState?\n\nuseState is a fundamental React Hook that allows functional components to manage state. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it, causing a re-render when the state changes. Unlike class components, useState enables state management without complex class syntax.\n\nReact's built-in hook for adding state to functional components is elegant in its simplicity. Call it and you get a state value plus a setter function that updates that value and triggers a re-render.\n\n```\nimport { useState } from 'react'; import { useState } from  'react'; function Example() {function  Example() { const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);  const [state, setState] =  useState(initialState); // ... // ...}}\n``` [...] ### Lazy Initialization for Expensive Computations\n\nReact runs the initializer on every render—unless you give it a function. Wrapping the initializer in a function defers the work until the first render, which matters when parsing large JSON, crunching numbers, or pulling from `localStorage`.\n\n```\nimport { useState } from 'react'; import { useState } from  'react'; function Dashboard() {function  Dashboard() { const [prefs, setPrefs] = useState(() => { const [prefs, setPrefs] =  useState(() => { const stored = localStorage.getItem('prefs');  const  stored = localStorage. getItem('prefs'); return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : { theme: 'light', compact: false };  return  stored ?  JSON. parse(stored) : { theme: 'light', compact: false }; }); });  // ... // ...}}\n``` [...] ```\nimport { useState } from 'react'; import { useState } from  'react'; export default function Counter() {export  default  function  Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  const [count, setCount] =  useState(0);  return ( return ( <button onClick={() => setCount(prev => prev + 1)}> < button  onClick ={() =>  setCount(prev =>  prev +  1)}> Clicked {count} times  Clicked {count}  times button>  button> ); );}}\n```\n\nEach click calls the setter, React queues the state change, and the button re-renders with the updated value. The `count` persists for the component's lifetime—it doesn't reset on every function call.\n\n## Common React useState Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them"

Provides us with a setter function to update the state variable and hence trigger a re-render of our component.\n\nWe can import the useState hook from react. The useState() hook takes in the initial value of the state variable as an argument and provides us with the state variable and the setter function. The variable could be of any data type, such as string, number, object, array, and more.\n\nFor Example:\n\n```\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n\nconst [number, setNumber] = useState(1);\n\nconst [string, setString] = useState('John Doe')\n\nconst [object, setObject] = useState({name: 'johndoe'}) [...] 🚀 Visual editing now available!Introducing Click to Edit\n\n Frontend\n React\n\n# useState() Hook in React - A Complete Guide\n\nLearn everything you need to know about the useState() hook, how it works, and some rules that guide how it works alongside examples for better understanding.\n\nLast updated byAagam\n\non Sep 23, 2024\n\nOriginally written by Joel\n\nReact is a free, open-source JavaScript frontend library that we can use to build frontend applications. Before React v16.8 in 2019, developers always used class components for data management (with states) and other operations like lifecycle methods, and functional components were only to be used for rendering UI. [...] ```\n\n// Do not do this\n\nif (condition) {\n\nconst [count, setCount] = useState()(0);\n\n}\n\n// Do not do this\n\nfor (let index = 0; index < 25; index++) {\n\nlet [count, setCount] = useState()(0);\n\n}\n\n// Do not do this\n\nconst nestedFn = () => () => {\n\nconst [count, setCount] = useState()(0);\n\n};\n\n```\n\n## #Conclusion\n\nIn this guide, we have learned what state is and why it is important, we learned about the useState() hook from React which helps us to manage a component’s memory. We also learned about the lifecycle of a state variable and how the new state value is enforced after a component’s re-render. Finally, we checked how to use objects and arrays as state variables and wrapped up by going through a few caveats about using hooks.\n\nBlog Authors\n\nAagam Vadecha\n\nJoel Olawanle"

In this article, we would be discussing the useState hook with practical examples.\n\n## An Introduction\n\nThe useState hook is used to manage state in React. State is simply data that can change over time. The useState hook lets us create a state variable, initialize it with data and also gives us access to a setter function that lets us update this state. [...] ```\nimport { useState } from \"react\";export default function App() { const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\"); return (   onClick={() => setEmail(\"dev@gmail.com\") } > Show    );}const ChildComponent = ({ email }) => { return <>{email && This {email} was passed from my dad!}>;};\n```\n\nThe `email` state variable is passed from the parent component, `App.jsx`, to `ChildComponent.jsx` which destructures the props object to access `email`. When a user clicks the show button, you get:\n\n## React State Variables vs Regular Variables\n\nYou may wonder why we don’t just use regular variables. We can, after all, declare and initialize a variable and also update/replace the value stored in it by reassignment."
