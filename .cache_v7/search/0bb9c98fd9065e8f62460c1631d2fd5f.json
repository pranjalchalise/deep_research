      "snippet": "## What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. By incorporating new and context-aware data, AI can generate more accurate, current and domain-specific responses.\n\nRAG is quickly becoming the go-to architecture for building enterprise-grade AI applications. According to recent surveys, over 60% of organizations are developing AI-powered retrieval tools to improve reliability, reduce hallucinations and personalize outputs using internal data. [...] 1. Prepare data: Document data is gathered alongside metadata and subjected to initial preprocessing — for example, PII handling (detection, filtering, redaction, substitution). To be used in RAG applications, documents need to be chunked into appropriate lengths based on the choice of embedding model and the downstream LLM application that uses these documents as context.\n2. Index relevant data: Produce document embeddings and hydrate a Vector Search index with this data.\n3. Retrieve relevant data: Retrieving parts of your data that are relevant to a user's query. That text data is then provided as part of the prompt that is used for the LLM. [...] As generative AI expands into business functions like customer service, internal knowledge management and compliance, RAG’s ability to bridge the gap between general AI and specific organizational knowledge makes it an essential foundation for trustworthy, real-world deployments.\n\nHere’s more to explore\n\nThe Big Book of MLOps\n\nA must-read for ML engineers and data scientists seeking a better way to do MLOps.\n\nGet the eBook\n\nAugment your LLM's using RAG\n\nHow to get more from generative AI with RAG.\n\nDownload now\n\nDatabricks ranked #1 in Execution and Vision\n\n2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms.\n\nRead now\n\n## How RAG works"

      "snippet": "Creating a text summarization app using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves a few steps. First, it's essential to build a system that can fetch relevant data from different sources like databases or documents with the help of data science libraries such as BeautifulSoup. This data is then converted into a form that's easy to search and use. RAG works by combining the user's query with additional context retrieved from external sources to create a more detailed prompt. This augmented prompt is then fed into a language model that generates concise and informative summaries. The process keeps evolving by updating the knowledge base and how the system understands text, ensuring the app keeps getting better at summarizing text.\n\n1. ### Web-Based Doc Summarization Bot using ChatGroq [...] 1. ### fastRAG\n\nfastRAG is a pioneering research framework that integrates cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) and Information Retrieval to refine retrieval-augmented-generative pipelines. It empowers data scientists and researchers by offering a comprehensive toolkit, resulting in advancements in this innovative fusion of retrieval and generation methodologies. Its recent updates have introduced substantial enhancements, such as support for Gaudi2, ONNX runtime, and LlamaCPP, alongside optimized embedding models and multi-modality and chat demos, including REPLUG text generation. [...] Start Project\n\nRetrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) is a fascinating approach in natural language processing that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. It's designed to enhance the capabilities of language models by incorporating a retriever module that can access and retrieve relevant information from a large external knowledge source, like a database or a collection of documents. The primary reason for its popularity is best highlighted in this post by Abhishek Ratna."

RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\n\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs.

Effective data pipeline construction and data storage is paramount for strong RAG implementation.\n\nAt the same time, developers and data scientists can tweak the data sources to which models have access at any time. Repositioning a model from one task to another becomes a task of adjusting its external knowledge sources as opposed to fine-tuning or retraining. If fine-tuning is needed, developers can prioritize that work instead of managing the model’s data sources.\n\n### Greater data security"
