      "snippet": "I’ve watched some of his intervews and he always comes off as a very earnest and humble guy with a sense of humour. What you see, is what you get – no pretending or putting on airs. His words are his own and not conocted by some image consious PR person. I’ve been a fan of CN Blue a lot longer and wanted to see them live for ages, but if I had a chance to go either to their concert or HDK’s concert, I’d choose the latter. No contest. This post is dedicated to the one and only Ha Dong Kyun, with ‘the voice you can’t forget once you hear him sing’.^^ [...] Ha Dong Kyun had not stood on a TV stage since 2008 (due to camera phobia?). He was a complete unknow to most foreign fans of Korean music and probably to quite a few younger Koreans as well. So his fans must have been surprised and overjoyed when he was anounced to be one of the performers of IS2’s 100th program. (Btw. Immortal Song is a GREAT program to discover wonderful but lesser know singers, I recommend it warmly. Subbed episodes can be found @ KBSWorld’s YT channel.) That stage, where he sang Jeon In Gwon’s 사랑한 후에 (After Love), seems to have become a new start. He was SO nervous beforehand and in the pre perf intervew said he was nervous (shaking) enough to die, performing in front of cameras was frightening. But once he started singing, it was like all that just melted away and [...] Since that fist encounter I’ve learned considerably more about this amazing singer. He debuted in 2002 as a member of R&B group 7Dayz, which released one album but disbanded soon after. One of the guys, Lee Jung, eventually became a solo songer (he was also quite the regular in IS2 last year) and Ha Dong Kyun with Seo Jae Ho, Jeon Sang Hwan and a new member Kim Jae Seok formed Wanted, another R&B vocal group and made their re-debut in 2004 with their first album called ‘Like The First‘. Wanted singing 발작 (Stroke) @ YD Loveletter."

According to an interview, he likes rock sounds and admires Deulgukhwa and Lee Seungyeol . One of the most popular songs in his karaoke is 'I'll Wait', a duet with Lee Jung. I rarely sang [...] In the interview, in the hallway, elevator, etc., the broadcast was awkward and the camera was afraid of it. According to Nagasu and other comments during interviews and performances, he gets cold sweats and gets dizzy when he sees the red light from the camera or the stage lights during filming. In fact, during the solo concert, as time passed, he showed a more restless appearance. Then, when her friend Lee Jeong comes as a guest, she turns to Lee Jeong next to the stage and sings without looking at the audience. She seemed to act as a tranquilizer.\n\n|  |\n\n| ▲ Unsettled by camera follow in the waiting room |"

      "snippet": "By Norimitsu Onishi\n\nReporting from Montreal\n\nA member of Canada’s Parliament testified on Tuesday that high school students from China were transported by bus to vote for him in a party election that is at the center of a federal inquiry into interference in Canadian elections by China and other foreign countries.\n\nTestifying during a public hearing in Ottawa, the Parliament member, Han Dong, a Chinese-Canadian politician formerly from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party, said that he had met and sought the support of the students from a private high school in 2019, but that he did not know who had chartered or paid for the bus on the day of the election. [...] Mr. Dong’s testimony was part of an ongoing federal inquiry into foreign meddling in Canada’s political system, especially the general elections of 2019 and 2021. The inquiry was called after a series of intelligence leaks to the Canadian news media indicated that the Chinese government had interfered in both elections by supporting candidates favorable to its policies and by undermining its critics.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
