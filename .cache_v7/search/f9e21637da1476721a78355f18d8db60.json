      "snippet": "Garvin expects security strategies to evolve inside SOCs as AI becomes more embedded. “The biggest shift will be the deeper integration of AI into defensive security operations. Organizations will increasingly invest in securing AI models and data pipelines, and they will evolve penetration testing and adversarial testing approaches to evaluate AI systems with the same rigor applied to traditional applications.”\n\nNadia Veeran-Patel, CISO at LRMG, has already seen this reshape incident workflows firsthand. “Our analysts were looking at incidents individually as they came through as alerts, but when AI brought them together as a collection, you suddenly realize those alerts are actually a series of events that led to something bigger.” [...] As AI becomes more deeply integrated, the sensitive data these systems rely on will become “an increasingly attractive target”, with more AI-enabled attack methods “poised to occupy a growing share of the threat landscape,” according to Michael Garvin, CISO at Jaggaer. As a result, he believes data security posture management will also become more important. “Because AI depends on large volumes of high-quality, sensitive data, organizations will need better visibility into how that data is accessed, classified, and protected.” [...] In response, Toal says organizations will need to secure their ownAI agents with the same rigor applied to human users. “We’ll have to treat internal AI agents as identities, and monitor what they access, when they run, and whether their behavior makes sense,” he says. Without that shift, he cautions, organizations risk unleashing tools inside their networks that attackers could readily turn against them."

Florentin Koch from École Polytechnique and HEC Paris, alongside colleagues, introduce ‘Recursivism’ , a novel conceptual paradigm to analyse art capable of self-transformation. This paper formalises recursion, a principle well-established in mathematics and computer science, as an aesthetic lens through which to view art that doesn’t just change its outputs, but actively modifies its own generative processes. By establishing a five-level analytical scale and three operational criteria , state memory, rule evolvability, and reflexive visibility , Koch et al. provide a crucial tool for distinguishing"

      "title": "When Chatbots Make the Call, How Can Retailers Leverage Query-Based Commerce? - Retail TouchPoints",
      "snippet": "Online retailers can’t simply drop a chatbot into their website or app and hope for the best. Everything from product listings to purchasing patterns and customer reviews must be meticulously structured for easy retrieval by AI systems, including the generative search engines that are fast becoming the first stop in shopping journeys. And with ChatGPT rolling out commerce integrations directly into its interface, understanding and leveraging AI’s position in the funnel will only become more vital to sales success.\n\n### The Fast-Approaching Query-Based Purchase Funnel [...] Advertisement\n\nThis creates a new arena for competition. Retailers are no longer vying solely for visibility on Google or online marketplaces; they are competing to be favorably interpreted by answer-generating machines. Messy product tagging and poorly written descriptions create gaps that AI models will fill with approximations drawn from external sources beyond a brand’s control. Given that LLMs can sometimes generate imperfect answers, brands should ensure they’re providing clear direction.\n\nAs such, more retailers are revisiting their product data taxonomies to improve consistency and ensure their attributes are intelligible to both humans and AI. If a retailer’s data does not provide a coherent story, AI systems won’t have much to work with. [...] ### The Fast-Approaching Query-Based Purchase Funnel\n\nGenerative platforms are training consumers to pick products via prompts rather than endless scrolling through listings. While AI-assisted shopping accounts for only a relatively small share of overall traffic, habits are changing rapidly. Between January and July of 2024, Adobe found that AI traffic to U.S. retailers more than quadrupled. The transition to a conversational sales funnel is picking up pace, and the first impression a chatbot provides for a product will matter as much as any listing or homepage."

      "title": "AthenaHQ Report Highlights Structural Shifts in SEO Caused by AI-Generated Search Results - markets.businessinsider.com",
      "snippet": "According to the analysis, AI-driven search features, including Google’s AI Overviews, are changing traditional click-through behavior. When AI-generated summaries appear in search results, click-through rates for the top organic listing decline by an average of 34.5 percent, indicating a shift in how users engage with search results.\n\nThe findings suggest that these changes reflect more than routine algorithm updates. Search engines are increasingly providing direct responses within search results, reducing the need for users to visit external websites and accelerating the growth of zero-click searches. The report notes that AI Overviews are designed to address user queries directly on the search engine results page, contributing to this trend. [...] The impact on publishers has been measurable. Smaller and mid-sized publishers have experienced traffic declines of up to 70 percent following the rollout of AI Overviews, according to multiple industry reports cited in the analysis. Data from Semrush shows that AI Overview visibility reached approximately 25 percent of all queries in mid-2025 before declining to 15.69 percent later in the year as accuracy and presentation adjustments were made. [...] “Marketing strategies are shifting toward addressing highly specific user questions rather than competing solely for high-volume keywords,” said James Moreno, Founding GTM at AthenaHQ.ai. “As AI-generated search results continue to expand, brands are reassessing how they measure visibility and success.”\n\nThe report also notes that performance measurement is evolving. Traditional rank tracking alone is no longer sufficient, as marketers increasingly monitor brand mentions, sentiment, and citation presence within AI-generated responses. This shift has led to greater demand for analytics solutions designed to assess visibility within generative search environments."
