Special thanks to Jared Friedman & Diana Hu, whom I first met while interviewing for the HackMIT 2023 YC Startup Pitch Challenge. I’m especially grateful for their outreach and support in encouraging me to submit prioritized referrals—because of that, I got to attend with Tina Zhang, Tairan (Ryan) Ji, and Liam Davis, bringing a small but proud Amherst College presence to this global stage. It was also a full-circle moment running into Ahmed A., an Amherst alum and my very first pre-orientation leader. Above all, I’m walking away inspired—by the conversations, the community’s generosity, and the collective energy to keep building.
