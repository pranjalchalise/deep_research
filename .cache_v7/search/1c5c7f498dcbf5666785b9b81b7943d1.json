      "snippet": "Since Claudius was the first emperor proclaimed on the initiative of the Praetorian Guard instead of the Senate, his repute suffered at the hands of commentators (such as Seneca). Moreover, they accused him of being the first emperor to resort to bribery as a means to secure army loyalty and rewarded the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard that had elevated him with 15,000 sesterces, although Tiberius and Augustus had both left gifts to the army and guard in their wills \"Will (law)\") and upon Caligula's death the same would have been expected, even if no will existed. Claudius remained grateful to the guard, issuing coins with tributes to the Praetorians in the early part of his reign.\n\n## Emperor\n\n[edit] [...] ### Public life\n\n[edit]\n\nClaudius's work as a historian damaged his prospects for advancement in public life. According to Vincent Scramuzza and others, he began work on a history of the Civil Wars that was either too truthful or too critical of Octavian, then reigning as Caesar Augustus. In either case, it was far too early for such an account, and may have only served to remind Augustus that Claudius was Antony's descendant. His mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it, and this may have convinced them that Claudius was not fit for public office, since he could not be trusted to toe the existing party line \"Party line (politics)\"). [...] Claudius set about remodeling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as noted in the fragments of a surviving speech:"

      "snippet": "Contrasting answers to the veracity of Claudius’ claims have emerged; many ancient historians describe Claudius as crude, with a propensity towards gluttony and the pleasures of the flesh, as well as a great lover of games and gladiatorial events, the bloodier the better. He was also a voracious gambler, to the point of addiction, and he \"[ate] himself to sleep\" often. Even within these depictions, however, there are contradictions; Claudius is painted as trusting, oft-confused, and easily manipulated by women, but also paranoid and cruel. Yet these stand in stark contrast to Claudius’ own writings, which show a dedicated public servant, intelligent and well-read. Now, it seems possible that Claudius' rather stunted social development might be more indicative of an isolated and fearful [...] Before we discuss the mystery of his death, his illnesses are, in some ways, just as mysterious. Several contemporary historians, such as Suetonius (author of The Twelve Caesars, one of the most important contemporary accounts of Roman history), have described Claudius’ litany of physical and mental faults in detail: weak knees, shakes, a stutter, and confused speech, as well as a tendency to foam at the mouth and drool. His laugh was described as ‘indecent,’ and his voice as ‘[belonging] to no land animal.’ Although some disagree on the extent of these issues (as well as the reliability of Suetonius himself), they’re generally accepted. Many diagnoses for Claudius have also been made, ranging from cerebral palsy to Tourette syndrome. Some have also suggested that many of the severest [...] After the assassination of Caligula by Caligula’s own Praetorian Guard, Claudius was dragged by the Guard from behind a curtain and appointed emperor. Claudius’ strange ascension to the throne followed him for the rest of his life, and made him unpopular in some circles, especially the Senate. But during his reign, he expanded the Roman empire majorly for the first time since Emperor Augustus, settled numerous disputes between provinces, changed the court system, created dozens of public works, and issued numerous edicts and reforms. Claudius faced several attempted coups, but weathered them."

      "snippet": "## 11. He Was Rebelliously Truthful\n\nClaudius came into his own as a talented historian with a knack for honesty. In his work on the Civil Wars, he did not shy away from an honest and truthful critique of the reigning Caesar Augustus, a member of Claudius’ own dynasty. His integrity damaged him further, however; his refusal to toe the party line and varnish his dynasty’s history only further damaged his prospects of holding public office. He would have to take matters into his own hands.\n\nFile:Octave (13668015683).jpgGautier Poupeau from Paris, France, Wikimedia Commons\n\nFile:Octave (13668015683).jpg\n\n## 12. He Appealed Directly To Power [...] Roman custom saw newly proclaimed rulers adopting their predecessors’ titles, but Claudius refused these, insisting to the Senate that he would earn them himself over time. This political astuteness would characterize his reign.\n\nFile:Cicero Denounces Catiline in the Roman Senate by Cesare Maccari.pngCesare Maccari, Wikimedia Commons\n\nFile:Cicero Denounces Catiline in the Roman Senate by Cesare Maccari.png\n\n## 22. He Was Good At His Job\n\nAfter all those years kept from public office by his family, Claudius proved them wrong during his stint as emperor. Despite his comparative lack of experience, he proved an incredibly capable and efficient administrator, gaining popularity among the public. He shored up his own support too. [...] ## 25. He Was An Ambitious Builder\n\nClaudius undertook many construction projects during his reign, most of them with an eye towards economic growth. Over the course of his time in office, he improved the country with projects like new roads and canals across the entire Roman empire. Some of these arose from a progressive social policy.\n\nFile:Détail de la maquette de Rome à lépoque de Constantin (5840455090).jpgJean-Pierre Dalbera from Paris, France, Wikimedia Commons\n\nFile:Détail de la maquette de Rome à lépoque de Constantin (5840455090).jpg\n\n## 26.

All came to light during her government, although nearly half occurred in the previous administration: 47% of the cases occurred during López Obrador’s term, 10% correspond to Peña Nieto’s government, and 41% took place between October 2024 and October 2025.

The 4T is dominated by a mafia of power made up of bigwigs who have gotten rich under the protection of the government and officials who allow organized crime to operate. They are all above the law.”\n\n###### Raymundo Riva Palacios:\n\n“Senator Adán Augusto López knows he is protected, which is why he has resisted for weeks the pressure from President Claudia Sheinbaum to step down from leading Morena in the upper house and accept an embassy post. … Neither Sheinbaum, nor a faction of Morena, nor the opposition, nor the press, nor even the United States, which has demanded it, has been able to move him, because he is backed by his patron saint: Andrés Manuel López Obrador.”"

      "snippet": "Disclosure 1993 Motion and Project In 1993, Senator Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu—the Chief of the Former Political Prisoners Association—initiated the motion “Law Concerning Dis-closure of the Securitate” (Legea deconspir˘ arii Securit˘ aţii). This was discussed by the Parliament and passed by the majority. It failed, however, to lead to concrete lustration measures. Soon, the motion became the “Bill on the Law Concerning Disclosure of the Securitate” (Proiect al legii deconspir˘ arii REPL Y TO DISCLOSURE SCANDALS IN ROMANIA 43 Securit˘ aţii). Deputy Claudiu Iordache also initiated another motion in the parliamentary term 1990–1992 (Burcea and Bumbeș, 2006: 256).\n1999 Law No. 187/1999 In seven years time, the aforementioned project of 1993 lead to Law No. 187/1999. [...] Lustration and Decommunization 1990 The 8th Point of Proclamation of Timișoara The Timișoara Proclamation was proclaimed in a public demonstration held in Timișoara on March 11, 1990 and organized by the Timișoara Society, Eu-44 ADRIANA MICA rope, and December 16, 1989 Associations (Pavel 2003: 44–47). The impor-tance of the Proclamation was primarily its straightforward division of black or white political afﬁnities. The 8th Point called for banning the former Ro-manian Communist Party nomenklatura and the Securitate cadres from pub-lic ofﬁce. Later on, George Șerban—the main author of the Proclamation— began drafting a bill on lustration on the basis of the principles contained in the 8th Point. [...] Romanian Genres of Transitional Justice In the following section, I will attempt to more clearly detail the meaning of the terms “disclosure,” “lustration” and “decommunization,” within the context of this paper. The process of “disclosure” refers to the institutionalized practice adopted by certain former Communist states, whereby institutions (parliamentary or govern-mental) issued—ex ofﬁcio or by request—certiﬁcates regarding the membership or collaboration of a person with former state security services, frequently referred to as “Communist political police.” References to “lustration” legislation and procedures primarily refer to legal acts and procedures of vetting public ofﬁcials in reference to Communist-era membership or collaboration with the former Communist state security"

      "snippet": "The Social Democratic Party (PSD), National Liberal Party (PNL), Save Romania Union (USR), Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), and representatives of national minorities have announced their commitment to form a pro-European government together. This coalition aims to establish a majority in the Romanian Parliament and is also considering the possibility of supporting a common candidate for the presidential elections.\nMirroring this initiative, Claudiu Târziu, the President of the National Leadership Council of AUR, has proposed the formation of a \"sovereignist political bloc\" with the parties AUR, SOS, and POT, which have a third of the seats in Parliament. [...] However, beneath these surface-level metrics lies a more nuanced picture of the campaign's digital footprint. Analysis of over 9,000 Telegram posts from 35 campaign-affiliated groups, active until their closure in early December, revealed a consistent pattern of controversial narratives. These groups served as echo chambers for conspiracy theories, historical revisionism, and anti-Western sentiment, though their content maintained a pragmatic tone that resonated with their audience's shared values. [...] The recount was done under controversial conditions, with no external observers being allowed and no video surveillance, as it happens during the regular counting of votes. The results were supposed to be announced on the same day as the parliamentary elections, but the announcement was delayed. More than 9 million votes were recounted in record time, thus, on December 2, the Constitutional Court announced that the first round of the elections was valid and that on December 8, the second round of the presidential elections will take place between Georgescu and Lasconi."
