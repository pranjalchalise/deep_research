      "snippet": "The rapid transformation of the social media platform X under Elon Musk’s ownership is raising significant concerns about its role in disseminating misinformation, disinformation, and shaping public opinion.(#ftnt2) Unlike misinformation, which involves the unintentional spread of false information,(#ftnt3) disinformation refers to the deliberate spread of falsehoods with the intent to influence public opinion.(#ftnt4) Recently, the platform has faced increased scrutiny over claims of electoral interference, with reports suggesting Musk is likely to be leveraging his large following to amplify support for right-wing political parties such as Reform UK in the United Kingdom,(#ftnt5) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in the upcoming German elections.(#ftnt6) Critics are questioning the [...] Following Elon Musk’s acquisition of X in 2022, the platform underwent significant structural and operational changes. Musk’s stated goal was to achieve political neutrality, aiming to address both far-left and far-right perspectives equally.(#ftnt8) Operational changes included the addition of X Premium, enabling users to obtain verified status and boost the visibility of their posts through a subscription model. Additionally, the launch of the community notes features shifted content moderation responsibilities, allowing users to identify and highlight misleading information instead of relying solely on platform administrators.(#ftnt9) However, these changes have raised concerns about the potential for increased manipulation of discourse on X,incentivized through financial gain of [...] Impact Analysis / Threat Assessment\n\nSocietal Impacts\n\nAs misinformation-driven political rhetoric spreads on social media platforms like X, its divisive nature will likely prompt some individuals to seek alternatives perceived as more politically neutral, like Bluesky. Users whose political views align closely with the amplified rhetoric will very likely remain active on such platforms, likely increasing their engagement with politically charged posts from like-minded individuals. This dynamic will almost certainly foster an echo chamber(#ftnt43) effect on these online communities, reinforcing political divisiveness on social media and further polarizing left and right-leaning users."

      "snippet": "In November 2023, the CCDH released a new report claiming 98% of misinformation, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other hate speech, in relation to the Gaza war, remained on X after 7 days of reporting, generating over 24 million views. X responded by detailing the removal of 3,000 accounts and taking action against 325,000 pieces of content, such as restricting the reach of a post. On November 24, the European Union halted advertisements on X referring to an \"alarming increase\" in hate speech and misinformation. A spokesperson for the European Commission confirmed that X is affected by the EU rules, and has advised European institutions to abstain from advertising on the platform. [...] In August 2024, several Labour \"Labour Party (UK)\") MPs in the United Kingdom reduced their use of Twitter or left the platform due to concerns about misinformation and hate speech under Musk's ownership. Some explored alternatives like Threads \"Threads (social network)\") and Bluesky, while the British government continued to use X, focusing on implementing stronger online safety regulations.\n\n### Increase in hate speech\n\n[edit] [...] In November 2022, X announced it would no longer enforce its policy prohibiting COVID-19 misinformation. Algorithm changes promoted viral disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and led to significant gains in followers for media outlets affiliated with Russia, China and Iran. Twitter, like Meta, Twitch, and Alphabet, laid off a significant portion of its content moderators in 2023."

      "snippet": "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.\n\nThere have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.\n\nOver the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private. [...] Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.\n\nOf course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation. [...] I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.\n\nAt the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has… trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".\n\nSeparately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses."

      "snippet": "> “Elon Musk has completed his transformation from free speech defender to champion of disinformation. Most of his decisions have had the effect of strengthening disinformation producers and weakening access to reliable news and information on his platform. What with the insults that he personally aims at the professional news media and the new anti-information direction that X is taking under his leadership, journalists and news media are no longer welcome there. Twitter was already an unsafe network for information, but X has become disinformation’s stronghold.”\n>\n> Vincent Berthier  \n>   \n>  Head of RSF’s Tech Desk [...] Twitter’s transformation has been political as well as technical. Under Musk’s leadership, Twitter ceased to be a signatory to the European Union's code of good practice against disinformation, now the code of conduct of the Digital Services Act (DSA). The social media company also carried out mass layoffs, especially within the “Trust and Safety” teams responsible for protecting platform users, including moderation. These decisions have necessarily strengthened disinformation’s competitive advantage over content that is in the public interest.

[...] Similar pages appear to be based in Thailand and Bangladesh, reigniting concerns among users about the suspected high number of “bots” in foreign countries that are spreading political and election-related misinformation about the US on the platform.\n\nHowever, because of the widespread use of VPNs, which mask users’ true locations, people cannot confirm the information they see, Jones said. As a result, X is effectively passing the responsibility for detecting fraud, spam bots or state-backed information operations on to users. [...] Now, it also shows details such as the country the account holder is based in, the date the account was created, the number of times the username has been changed – and when – and the country of origin at the time of creation. It also indicates whether the app has been installed on an Android device or via the iOS App Store and in which country.\n\nIf the account is verified, it also displays the date it was verified. For some verified profiles, company affiliation also shows, such as X for Musk or the United States State Department for US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nX said this is necessary to ensure content posted on the platform is “authentic” and transparent."
