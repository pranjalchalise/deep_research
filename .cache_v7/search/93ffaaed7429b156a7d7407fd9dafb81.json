      "snippet": "## Conclusion\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offer a powerful approach to enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models by leveraging external data sources. However, RAG systems also come with their own set of limitations and challenges across the retrieval, augmentation, and generation phases.\n\nTo unlock the full potential of RAG systems, it is crucial to address these limitations through advanced techniques and strategies. By employing approaches such as word sense disambiguation, semantic search, multi-hop reasoning, data cleaning, query decomposition, diversity-aware ranking, and latency optimization, RAG systems can overcome the challenges and provide more accurate, contextually relevant, and responsive results. [...] ## Augmentation Phase Limitations\n\nThe augmentation phase in RAG systems involves processing and integrating the retrieved information to enhance the response generation. However, this phase can also present challenges that impact the quality and coherence of the generated output.\n\n1. Inadequate augmentation — naive RAG systems may struggle to properly contextualize or synthesize the retrieved data, leading to augmentation that lacks depth or fails to accurately address the nuances of the query. This can result in generated responses that are superficial or fail to capture the full scope of the information. [...] 1. Matching based on wrong criteria — another limitation in the retrieval phase is the tendency of RAG systems to match queries based on broad similarities rather than specific details. For instance, when searching for information on “Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),” the system might retrieve documents that mention RAG but fail to capture the specific context or nuances of the query.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, advanced RAG systems can employ more sophisticated matching techniques, such as semantic search or query expansion. By understanding the intent behind the query and expanding it with related terms or concepts, RAG systems can improve the precision and relevance of the retrieved information."

      "snippet": "## 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation\n\nWith the explosion in popularity of large language model services such as ChatGPT222 Claude333 and Bard 444 people have explored their use as a question and answering systems. While the performance is impressive (OpenAI, 2023) there are two fundamental challenges: 1) hallucinations - where the LLM produces a response that looks right but is incorrect, and 2) unbounded - no way to direct or update the content of the output (other than through prompt engineering). A RAG system is an information retrieval approach designed to overcome the limitations of using a LLM directly. [...] ## 2. Related Work\n\nRetrieval augmented generation encompasses using documents to augment large language models through pre-training and at inference time  (Izacard and Grave, 2020; Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020). Due to the compute cost, data preparation time and required resources using RAG without training or fine-tuning is an attractive proposition. However, challenges arise when using large language models for information extraction such as performance with long text (Hofstätter et al., 2023). [...] Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offer a compelling solution to this challenge. By integrating retrieval mechanisms with the generative capabilities of LLMs, RAG systems can synthesise contextually relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combines information retrieval capabilities, and generative prowess of LLMs. The retrieval component focuses on retrieving relevant information for a user query from a data store. The generation component focuses on using the retrieved information as a context to generate an answer for the user query. RAG systems are an important use case as all unstructured information can now be indexed and available to query reducing development time no knowledge graph creation and limited data curation"

      "snippet": "Leximancer\nLeximancer\n\n# Everything Wrong with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to some of the biggest challenges facing large language models (LLMs). By combining the creative power of generative AI with the precision of information retrieval, RAG aims to reduce hallucinations and provide more grounded, trustworthy outputs.\n\nHowever, while the concept is compelling, RAG is far from perfect. Beneath its polished surface lies a host of limitations and challenges that can hinder its reliability, scalability, and utility. Let’s dive into what’s wrong with RAG and why it’s not the silver bullet some claim it to be.\n\n#### 1. Dependency on Retrieval Quality [...] Retrieval-Augmented Generation holds promise, but it’s no panacea. Its reliance on retrieval quality, susceptibility to bias, and scalability challenges make it unsuitable for many use cases in its current form. While RAG offers a pathway to more accurate and trustworthy AI, its limitations must be addressed before it should be able to achieve widespread adoption.\n\nFor now, organisations considering RAG should approach it with caution, ensuring they have the infrastructure, expertise, and ethical safeguards needed to deploy it responsibly. Only then can we move closer to fulfilling its potential as a tool for reliable, grounded AI generation.\n\n## The Mirage of Hybrid Search: Is Combining BM25 with Contextual Embeddings Worth the Hype? [...] #### 2. Latency and Scalability Challenges\n\nIntegrating a retrieval step into the generative process can dramatically increase response times. While this may not matter for small-scale academic use, it’s a significant bottleneck for real-time applications.\n\nSearch Time: Retrieving information from a large corpus or external database can take time, particularly if complex ranking or filtering mechanisms are involved.\n\nComputation Overhead: Generating responses after retrieving and processing relevant data requires more computational resources, making RAG systems less scalable than standalone LLMs.\n\n#### 3. Limited Context Integration\n\nWhile RAG systems aim to combine retrieved information with the generative model’s pre-trained knowledge, this integration is often shallow."

      "snippet": "Copy page\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs\n\nThere are many challenges when working with LLMs such as domain knowledge gaps, factuality issues, and hallucination. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a solution to mitigate some of these issues by augmenting LLMs with external knowledge such as databases. RAG is particularly useful in knowledge-intensive scenarios or domain-specific applications that require knowledge that's continually updating. A key advantage of RAG over other approaches is that the LLM doesn't need to be retrained for task-specific applications. RAG has been popularized recently with its application in conversational agents. [...] When augmentation is applied, there could also be issues with redundancy and repetition. When using multiple retrieved passages, ranking and reconciling style/tone are also key. Another challenge is ensuring that the generation task doesn't overly depend on the augmented information which can lead to the model just reiterating the retrieved content.\n\n### Advanced RAG. [...] Context length: LLMs continue to extend context window size which presents challenges to how RAG needs to be adapted to ensure highly relevant and important context is captured.\n   Robustness: Dealing with counterfactual and adversarial information is important to measure and improve in RAG.\n   Hybrid approaches: There is an ongoing research effort to better understand how to best optimize the use of both RAG and fine-tuned models.\n   Expanding LLM roles: Increasing the role and capabilities of LLMs to further enhance RAG systems is of high interest.\n   Scaling laws: Investigation of LLM scaling laws and how they apply to RAG systems are still not properly understood."

[...] 1. The strategies used for deciding when to make use of RAG as apposed to other methods often rely on a set of static rules. The conversational UI usually has a number of parameters which triggers a call to the RAG implementation.\n2. The strategies for deciding what to retrieve typically limit themselves to the LLM’s most recent sentence or the last few tokens.\n3. With the lookup trigger not being optimised, unnecessary retrievals take place.\n4. These unnecessary and un-optimised retrievals can add unwanted noise, where the retrieved data is not optimised.\n5. The overhead in text adds additional cost and inference wait time, potentially timeouts.\n6. RAG does not necessarily maintain and take into consideration the complete contextual span of the conversation. [...] 3. Enhanced Observability & Inspectability: Fine-tuning a base model often lacks transparency, resulting in limited observability and inspectability during both the fine-tuning process and in production. In contrast, RAG provides a higher level of observability and inspectability as it is not as opaque as adjusting the base model. Questions or user inputs can be compared with retrieved chunks of contextual data, which can then be contrasted with the responses generated by LLMs.\n\n4. Simplified Maintenance: Continuous maintenance of a RAG solution is more manageable due to its compatibility with a less technical and incremental approach. This makes it easier to address evolving needs and challenges over time.\n\n## Traditional RAG shortcomings"
