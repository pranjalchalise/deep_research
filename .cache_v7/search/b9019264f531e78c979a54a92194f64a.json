It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable users to create, run and optimize large language models (LLMs) in a scalable and efficient manner. At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow. [...] LangGraph workflow\n\nLangGraph illuminates the processes within an AI workflow, allowing full transparency of the agent’s state. Within LangGraph, the “state” feature serves as a memory bank that records and tracks all the valuable information processed by the AI system. It’s similar to a digital notebook where the system captures and updates data as it moves through various stages of a workflow or graph analysis. [...] Agent systems: LangGraph provides a framework for building agent-based systems, which can be used in applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles or video games.\n\nLLM applications: By using LangGraph’s capabilities, developers can build more sophisticated AI models that learn and improve over time. Norwegian Cruise Line uses LangGraph to compile, construct and refine guest-facing AI solutions. This capability allows for improved and personalized guest experiences.\n\n## LLM integration in LangGraph"

      "snippet": "Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents— including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more— LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent orchestration. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with models and tools.We will commonly use LangChain components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don’t need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain’s agents that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling [...] pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more. [...] LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for _any_ long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:\n   Durable execution: Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.\n   Human-in-the-loop: Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.\n   Comprehensive memory: Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.\n   Debugging with LangSmith: Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics."

It's exciting, but it comes with challenges: managing the state of various agents, coordinating their interactions, and handling errors effectively. This is where LangGraph can help.\n\nLangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to tackle these challenges head-on. LangGraph provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner. [...] ### Chatbots\n\nLangGraph is ideal for developing sophisticated chatbots that can handle a wide array of user requests. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, these chatbots can process natural language queries, provide accurate responses, and seamlessly switch between different conversation topics. The ability to manage state and coordinate interactions ensures that the chatbot maintains context and delivers a coherent user experience.\n\n### Autonomous agents\n\nFor applications requiring autonomous decision-making, LangGraph enables the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic. [...] ### Simplified development\n\nLangGraph abstracts away the complexities associated with state management and agent coordination. This means developers can define their workflows and logic without worrying about the underlying mechanisms that ensure data consistency and proper execution order. This simplification accelerates the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors. It’s a game-changer!\n\n### Flexibility"

      "snippet": "## LangGraph: Your Go-To for Stateful Agent Systems\n\nLangGraph is a specialized extension of LangChain that focuses on stateful applications. Instead of writing workflows as a linear script, you define them as a graph of nodes and edges — essentially a state machine. Each node represents an action (like calling an LLM, querying a database, or checking a condition), while the edges define how the flow moves depending on the results. This structure makes it easier to handle loops, branching, and retries without your code turning into a tangle of if/else statements. [...] ```\n# LangGraph graph structure definition\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nclass State(TypedDict):\n    messages: list\n    current_step: str\n\ndef node_a(state: State) -> State:\n    return {\"messages\": state[\"messages\"] + [\"Processing A\"], \"current_step\": \"A\"}\n\ndef node_b(state: State) -> State:\n    return {\"messages\": state[\"messages\"] + [\"Processing B\"], \"current_step\": \"B\"}\n\ngraph = StateGraph(State)\ngraph.add_node(\"node_a\", node_a)\ngraph.add_node(\"node_b\", node_b)\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\")\n\n```\n\nWhere LCEL gives you a clean linear pipeline, LangGraph natively supports loops, branching, and conditional flows. This makes it a stronger fit for agent-like systems or multi-step interactions that don’t follow a straight line."

The classes from LangChain might be used in LangGraph, but do not HAVE to be used. [...] `LangGraph` is on the other end of the spectrum, it shines when you need “Control” on the execution of your agent.\n\nLangGraph is particularly valuable when you need Control over your applications. It gives you the tools to build an application that follows a predictable process while still leveraging the power of LLMs.\n\nPut simply, if your application involves a series of steps that need to be orchestrated in a specific way, with decisions being made at each junction point, LangGraph provides the structure you need.\n\nAs an example, let’s say we want to build an LLM assistant that can answer some questions over some documents. [...] The key scenarios where LangGraph excels include:\n\n Multi-step reasoning processes that need explicit control on the flow\n Applications requiring persistence of state between steps\n Systems that combine deterministic logic with AI capabilities\n Workflows that need human-in-the-loop interventions\n Complex agent architectures with multiple components working together\n\nIn essence, whenever possible, as a human, design a flow of actions based on the output of each action, and decide what to execute next accordingly. In this case, LangGraph is the correct framework for you!\n\n`LangGraph` is, in my opinion, the most production-ready agent framework on the market.\n\n## How does LangGraph work?\n\nAt its core, `LangGraph` uses a directed graph structure to define the flow of your application:"
