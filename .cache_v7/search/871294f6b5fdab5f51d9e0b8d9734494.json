      "snippet": "“Enter the Dragon” was the last film Lee completed before his untimely death in 1973 at the age of 32, and it points to the stellar Hollywood career he could’ve had. He stars as a martial arts expert who agrees to spy on a drug kingpin by accepting his invitation to a kung fu tournament. Director Robert Clouse forgoes plot in favor of mind-blowing fight sequences, showing off the very best of his star’s abilities. Look out for Jackie Chan in an early role.\n\nQuantcast [...] His hiatus from the screen didn’t last long. In 1966, Lee was cast as Kato in the short-lived television adventure “The Green Hornet,” later making appearances as the character on “Batman.” He played a small role in the mystery film “Marlowe” (1969) as a kung fu fighter who destroys private eye James Garner’s office before suffering a tragic demise.\n\nLee became a leading man after returning to Hong Kong to make “The Big Boss” (1971). It was the first in a series of martial arts films the actor would headline, including “Fist of Fury” (1972), “The Way of the Dragon” (1973), and the posthumously released “Game of Death” (1978). [...] Hollywood came calling once again with “Enter the Dragon” (1973), a big budget spectacular that could have launched the actor to superstardom had he not died from cerebral edema three weeks before it opened. (In a sad irony, Lee’s son, Brandon, died in 1993 at the age of 28 while filming “The Crow” when an improperly loaded prop gun misfired.)\n\nTour our gallery of Bruce Lee movies, and see if your favorite topped the list.\n\n## 6. GAME OF DEATH (1978)\n\nBruce-Lee-Movies-Ranked-Game-of-Death\n\nDirected by Bruce Lee and Robert Clouse. Written by Lee. Starring James Tien, Chieh Yuan, Dan Inosanto, Ji Han-jae, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hwang In-shik."
