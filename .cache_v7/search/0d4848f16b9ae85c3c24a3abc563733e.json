A prominent figure during the late 2nd and early 1st century BC, this Roman general and statesman became one of the most influential figures in the history of the Late Roman Republic. The man is best remembered for his deadly rivalry with Lucius Cornelius Sulla, a rivalry that ultimately ended in the first Roman civil war of the 1st century BC. But how did Marius rise to such a prominent position? To talk through the rise of Marius, Tristan was delighted to be joined by Professor Federico Santangelo from the University of Newcastle. In this episode we focus on Marius’ early career, up until his first consulship.

      "snippet": "## Menu\n\n# Gaius Marius\n\nGaius Marius was a significant Roman general and political leader born around 157 BCE near Arpinum, Italy. Initially a farmer's son with limited formal education, Marius excelled in military service, first fighting in Spain against the Numantines and later rising through the ranks. His political career began in the Roman Republic, where he served as tribune of the people and later as consul multiple times, notably during critical military conflicts such as the Jugurthine War and against Germanic tribes like the Cimbri and Teutons. [...] ## Gaius Marius\n\nRoman general\n\nMarius was a successful Roman general whose military innovations created the professional army of the late Roman Republic and early Empire. Representing the Popular Party, he was elected consul seven times.\n\n## Early Life [...] Marius is particularly known for his military reforms, including the recruitment of volunteers from the lower classes, which transformed the Roman army into a professional fighting force. This shift not only enhanced military effectiveness but also changed soldiers' loyalties from the state to their generals, laying the groundwork for future political upheaval. Despite his military successes, Marius struggled politically, especially during his later years, where his ambition led him into tumultuous alliances that ultimately resulted in his political downfall. He died in 86 BCE, leaving behind a legacy marked by military innovation but marred by his failures in political leadership amidst Rome's growing civil discord.\n\n## Gaius Marius\n\nRoman general"

      "snippet": "## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarius was an extremely successful Roman general and politician. In ancient sources, he has been repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism. Plutarch says of him:\n\n> if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age. [...] After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate [...] In the next campaigning year, Marius is listed as one of the senior legates of the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus \"Publius Rutilius Lupus (consul)\"), who was perhaps one of his relatives. Lupus fell to a Marsic ambush on 11 June 90 BC while crossing the river Tolenus; Marius, commanding a different wing of the army, was yet able to drive the enemy back with heavy losses. The senate, after Lupus' death, appointed Marius in joint command with the praetor Quintus Servilius Caepio \"Quintus Servilius Caepio (quaestor 103 BC)\"); Caepio, however, quickly fell to a Marsic act of perfidy, leaving Marius in sole command. After taking command over the northern front of the war, Marius moved energetically forward, defeating the Marsi with his former legate Sulla's help on hilly ground south of the"

As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer.
