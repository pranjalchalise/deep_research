      "snippet": "This includes weighing in on the debate over immigration in the United Kingdom and France, as well as calling for the U.K.'s King Charles III to dissolve Parliament. Musk also made controversial waves with his alleged support of AfD, a far right party in Germany accused of Nazi sympathies and labeled by Germany's intelligence domestic agency to be extremist. While AfD was boxed out of the government coalition following the country's election, it saw the best results for a far right party in Germany since World War II, as \"voter support flocks to AfD,\" said The Wall Street Journal. This is one area where the Trump administration and Musk continue agree post-rift, as Vice President J.D. Vance has praised AfD and criticized Germany for labeling it extremist. [...] While many people online accused Musk of making the Nazi salute, others weren't so sure — including the ADL itself. Musk \"made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute,\" the organization said on X. However, the ADL later criticized Musk more harshly after he appeared to mock the controversy online. This was \"not the first time that Trump or someone close to him has been accused of sending fascist messages, even if they denied doing so,\" Matthew Kriner, a former director at Middlebury College's Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, said at The Conversation.\n\n## Influence in geopolitics [...] Many Americans have felt Musk had vast control over portions of the government — even though they didn't want him to; 51% of Americans thought he had significant influence over Trump, but only 13% thought this was a good thing, according to a February 2025 YouGov survey.\n\n## Falling-out with Trump\n\nThe White House honeymoon ended less than six months after it began. A \"widening rift between the two\" came amid reports that they were already drifting apart, said the BBC. Then Musk parted ways with his government job at the end of May 2025, and soon after, he began criticizing Trump's spending bill — which would add trillions to the national deficit — calling it a \"disgusting abomination.\""

      "snippet": "In August 2023, Musk criticized the \"Kill the Boer\" song which was sung by Julius Malema during a rally for the far-left South African political party Economic Freedom Fighters, asserting that the song advocated the genocide of white people, which was rejected by Malema. A month later, Musk assured Benjamin Netanyahu that he was against antisemitism. Musk discussed the issues online with a panel of right-leaning Jewish leaders including former Israeli president Reuven Rivlin, attorney Alan Dershowitz, who represented Donald Trump in his first impeachment trial, as well as several Rabbis including Shmuley Boteach, where Musk denied allegations of antisemitism and cited the suspension of Kanye West as an example of enforcement on his platform. The group also criticized the ADL's criticism [...] January 2, 2025\n\nMusk has defended the use of H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S, having once been on the same visa. In December 2024, during a period of online discussion on whether H-1B visas should be reformed, he said that Silicon Valley firms need foreign workers (via H-1B) because there are not enough \"super motivated\" and \"super talented engineers\" in America. This was controversial and drew criticism from opponents of immigration who believe that importing foreign workers would negatively impact American workers, and the debate was dubbed the \"MAGA Civil War\". U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders criticised Musk's stance, viewing it as the importation of cheap labour that benefits billionaires.\n\n### Judiciary [...] Musk has received criticism over his views and actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In early 2020, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\", stated that \"the coronavirus panic is dumb\", and that the \"danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo \"IMO (in my opinion)\") [in my opinion]. If we over-allocate medical resources to corona, it will come at expense of treating other illnesses\". Musk has additionally been criticized for tweeting contentious comments on the disease, including that \"Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable\", and for speculating that the pandemic would soon be ending according to \"current trends\". In addition, he promoted articles which suggested that healthcare companies were inflating"

      "snippet": "## Musk is questioned about alleged drug use\n\nOn Friday, a reporter in the Oval Office asked Musk about the New York Times’ reported allegations that he regularly consumed ketamine, ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms when traveling with Trump on the campaign trail in 2024. \"The New York Times. Is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate? Let’s move on,\" Musk said when asked about the report, seemingly referencing conservative criticism of the publication's coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. [...] During his leadership at DOGE, Musk implemented a slew of far-reaching changes in his bid to eliminate waste within the government. His cuts at federal agencies and the termination of billions of dollars of government contracts—many of which have reportedly since been revived—prompted much criticism.\n\nAnd Musk has personally taken a hit, too. His Tesla showrooms have been the subject of arson attacks and people have boycotted both him and his businesses in protest.\n\nRead More:Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere’s a look back at Musk’s most controversial moments.\n\n## Musk is questioned about alleged drug use [...] ## Musk criticizes Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”\n\nShortly before announcing that his DOGE role was coming to its scheduled end, Musk criticized Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" in a public forum. During an interview with CBS, he agreed that the spending bill—which is now heading to the Senate—undermines the spending cuts brought about by DOGE.  \n  \n“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit,” Musk said. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don’t know if it can be both, [that’s] my personal opinion.”"

      "snippet": "“Surveys show that, even during difficult economic times, 92% of employees would leave their current job to work for an employer with an excellent ethical reputation.”\n\nHLT: Is the amount of criticism that Elon Musk and his companies receive relative to others a form of observation bias because they’re simply in the limelight more often?\n\nNelson: I don’t think so. There are at least two reasons why this story and sector have gripped our attention. The first is that what’s going on at Tesla and Twitter, as two examples of Musk’s companies, is not the way that people at other companies are necessarily behaving or at the magnitude that other people are doing similar things. Elon Musk has already been fined over $20 million by the SEC for things that he’s tweeted and said to investors. [...] Testifying recently at his trial for tweeting in 2018 that he had secured funding to take the electric car company Tesla private, Elon Musk suggested that people shouldn’t believe everything that he writes on the social network he now owns, telling the court that, “Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly.” Having already been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the famous billionaire entrepreneur who also oversees SpaceX was being sued by shareholders who claim they lost billions when Tesla’s stock initially rose, then suddenly dropped when a deal failed to materialize. Although the jury ultimately did not impose liability on Musk for the tweet, questions about his business practices remain."

      "snippet": "The White House official dismissed the criticisms as partisan, saying there is no concern in the White House about whether Musk will follow strict ethics rules.\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n###### Connect\n\n###### About NPR\n\n###### Get Involved\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor [...] Briffault is not alone in raising alarms about Musk's large business holdings creating a conflict with his work in the government.\n\n\"Musk seems to be in a position with the White House's consent that he can just change hats by the hour as it suits him,\" said Don Fox, who was the top lawyer at the Office of Government Ethics during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.\n\nFox said there's little indication the normal process to avoid conflicts is being followed. For high-level government employees, including those like Musk, that generally involves filing a financial disclosure report and coming to an ethics agreement with the Office of Government Ethics to identify potential conflicts and commit to a plan for avoiding them. [...] All these questions about Musk come as Trump just fired the Biden-appointed and Senate-confirmed director of the office of Government Ethics, who was only a couple of months into a five-year term. Other watchdogs have also been fired across the government.\n\n\"Whatever the guardrails are there in terms of preventing public officials from engaging in self-dealing, enforcement seems to be gone,\" said Briffault.\n\n### The nature of his leadership\n\nWith Musk's role, it's almost impossible for anyone on the outside to see what he's actually doing. Because Musk is working out of the Executive Office of the President, there are no requirements for public disclosure. Musk, however, insists his work is transparent, as he posts on social media regularly about contracts DOGE claims to have canceled."

[...] US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".\n\nMusk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\n\nWhat is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.
