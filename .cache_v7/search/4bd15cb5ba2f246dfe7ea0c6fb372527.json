      "snippet": "Copy Link\n Facebook\n X\n Reddit\n Bluesky\n\nPlaying For Keeps, the excellent Michael Jordan book by the late Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author David Halberstam, examines the life of the greatest basketball player ever to live through the lens of the 1997-98 NBA season. That was Jordan’s last year with the Chicago Bulls—a tense, uncertain journey that nonetheless culminated in the team’s sixth championship in eight years, and cemented Jordan’s legacy as an American superhero. That fraught season is the thread running through Halberstam’s narrative, but he goes backward in time to examine the lives of Jordan, his teammates, his coaches, and the Bulls front office to paint as complete a picture as possible of an iconic man at the height of his powers. [...] There can be endless debates about whether Jordan is better than LeBron James, the hero of the current age, but what The Last Dance reminds is that he was more fun to watch, and his dominance is of a rarer, more spectacular variety. Even as he aged, and lost some of the initial explosiveness, the physical nature of his game was no less beautiful, no less free-flowing, despite the fact that the unworldly athleticism now appeared only in select moments, and the scoring came in silky turnaround jumpers rather than gravity-defying flights into the lane. LeBron’s talent and strength and intelligence is evident in every move he makes, but his is a bludgeoning greatness. With Jordan there’s a different, more indescribable element—some ineffable combination of beauty and genius and will—unique to [...] The reason to watch The Last Dance, then, is not to learn something new about Michael Jordan, especially not if you’re of an age in which you have been steeped in the man’s legend for a lifetime. The reason to watch is to relive his most famous moments, and for something that no book could deliver—a visual reminder of his physical gifts. Jordan is a beautiful human being at rest, but in motion, he’s a revelation. To see the younger version of him soar through the air for a shattering dunk is to see pure grace and pure power co-exist. Even among the best basketball players in the world, he is on a different plane, and to see it all again leaves you jaw-agape. We all become Larry Bird, interviewed after Jordan scored 63 against his Celtics in an early playoff game, who can’t find the words"

      "snippet": "While the focus of the documentary series is on the Bulls' 1997-1998 season, in which Jordan and his teammates captured their sixth NBA championship, the first episode also examines Jordan's earliest days as a public figure, starting with his freshman college season.\n\nWhen he arrived at UNC, the expectations around Jordan were not befitting a player who would go on to reach the Hall of Fame and one day boast an estimated net worth of $2.1 billion. In fact, legendary UNC head coach Dean Smith said in one interview included in the documentary that Jordan was \"inconsistent as a freshman,\" but the teenager's work ethic still stood out.\n\n\"He was one of the most competitive [players] we've ever had in our drills,\" Smith said. \"He wanted to get better and then he had the ability to get better.\" [...] Jordan would play three seasons at UNC before the Bulls selected him with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA Draft. Once he entered the NBA, Jordan once again found himself needing to work harder than ever to improve his skills and prove himself to his teammates.\n\n\"From the first day of practice, my mentality was: 'Whoever is the team leader of the team, I'm going to be going after him. And I'm not going to do it with my voice.' Because I had no voice. I had no status. I had to do it with the way that I played,\" Jordan tells ESPN about his rookie year in Chicago. [...] Another former UNC teammate, Matt Doherty, echoed that sentiment in a recent interview. All of the UNC players respected Jordan, Doherty said, because while he was extremely talented, he was also \"a sponge, he listened, he learned and he competed.\"\n\nAnd Jordan definitely got better as his freshman season went on. Worthy, who went on to have a Hall of Fame career himself, jokes in the documentary that he started their season at UNC together as the better player, but that didn't last long.\n\n\"I was better than he was ... for about two weeks,\" Worthy says of Jordan.\n\nBy the end of his freshman season, Jordan \"was a great player,\" Worthy says."

      "snippet": "Moreover, this is a team whose personalities, personal dramas and feats warrant just this sort of excess. It’s a team that inspired its own commandments: Thou shall not doubt. Jordan’s 15 seasons of brilliance, cunning, ruthlessness, volition, perfectionism and artistry render him impervious to overstatement. He essentialized the sneaker as casual wear and luxury item. He made cause-free celebrity — cause-free black celebrity, no less — seem viable, preferable to having to mean all things to all people. One size had to fit all. Few team players had ever became as rock-star, movie-star famous and with nary a scandal the way Jordan had — almost exclusively through athletic supremacy. There was basketball Jordan and Air Jordan. No athlete anywhere will ever have a mid-motion logo as [...] The series is this ocean of archival game clips, dunk montages, smack talk, mea culpas, cigar smoking, backstabbing, frontstabbing, manfully restrained tears, endorsements of the triangle offense, interviews with anybody who even blinked at the N.B.A. from 1984 to 1998, including with Jordan’s mother, Deloris, whose serenity creates the flabbergasting illusion that she’s younger than her 57-year-old son. I can think of maybe four living athletes important enough to lure the participation of two living ex-presidents (Bill Clinton, Barack Obama), but only one whose team could necessitate appearances by both of those guys plus Carmen Electra. This thing is absurdly, almost comically, exhaustive. [...] Read more on the death of [Michael Jordan’s father, James Jordan.]\n\nIn Pippen, Jordan had the greatest wingman ever; in Rodman, the most mercurial, most formidable Dennis. In Jackson, among the least likely of masterminds. How did the team’s core last so long? How’d it keep winning so big, bigger, biggest? Over and over, the series reminds you how many times things came yea close to falling apart. And, remarkably, even then, the pieces were reassembled and reconfigured for further dominance.\n\nYou could call these 10 hours a walk down memory lane. But that’d be like calling Mardi Gras a parade."
