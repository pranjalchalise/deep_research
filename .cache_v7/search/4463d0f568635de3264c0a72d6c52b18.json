      "snippet": "Sammy Lee was the first Asian-American man to win an Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe son of Korean immigrants, Lee faced racial prejudice and could swim in his Southern California community pool only one day per week – nonwhite children were permitted to swim only on International Day each Wednesday, the day before the pool’s weekly draining and cleaning. But Lee was inspired by the Los Angeles 1932 Olympic Games and set his mind to become an Olympian.\n\nWhile attending Occidental College in Los Angeles, Lee won the 3-meter springboard and 10-meter platform diving events at the 1942 AAU National Championships. He graduated from Occidental the following year and enrolled in medical school. [...] Lee did not compete much over the next four years, but still qualified for the Helsinki 1952 Olympic Games. He contemplated skipping the Olympics because of a sense of duty to the army, but he was given one month off to train. In Helsinki, Lee became the first diver to successfully defend his gold medal in the 10-meter platform event. He later was presented the James E. Sullivan Award in 1953 as the nation’s top amateur athlete.\n\nWhile Lee focused on his career as an ear, nose and throat doctor, he remained involved in diving as a coach. He coached the 1960 U.S. Olympic Team and the 1964 Japanese and Korean Olympic teams. [...] Lee returned to competition in 1946 and again won the AAU national championship in the 10-meter platform event. Upon graduation from the University of Southern California School of Medicine in 1947, he joined the U.S. Army Reserves and served in the Korean War.\n\nLee, who was 5 feet 1 and used his stature to his advantage in diving, qualified for the London 1948 Olympic Games. After The Olympics were canceled in 1940 and 1944 because of World War II, Lee made his mark in London, taking bronze in the 3-meter springboard and doing a remarkable 3 ½ forward somersaults to win gold in the 10-meter platform."

      "snippet": "### 2011 season\n\nPromoted to starting inside linebacker in 2011, Lee thrived immediately in new defensive coordinator Rob Ryan's scheme. In the opening game versus the New York Jets, Lee intercepted Mark Sanchez to record the third interception of his career. His key interception of Rex Grossman and fumble recovery in the final minute of the Cowboys' Monday Night Football game versus the Washington Redskins were crucial in the 18-16 comeback.\n\nBy Week 3, Lee had a team-leading 36 tackles, 2 interceptions, 2 fumble recoveries, a tackle for a loss, and three pass breakups, earning him NFC Defensive Player of the Month honors. He was the first Cowboys player in franchise history to win the award. [...] ### 2010 season\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys selected Lee in the second round (55th overall) of the 2010 NFL draft. The Cowboys traded their second round (59th overall) and their fourth round picks (125th overall) in the 2010 NFL Draft to the Philadelphia Eagles in order to move up from to 55th overall in the second round to select Lee. It was speculated that his considerable fall from the first round was due to his history of injuries, that included a torn ACL on the right knee and partially torn ACL on the left knee during his last two seasons at Penn State, and throughout his career, injuries had indeed prevented Lee from playing a full season's slate of NFL games. Lee was the fourth linebacker selected in the draft. [...] On June 23, 2010, the Cowboys signed Lee to a four-year, $3.49 million contract that included $1.71 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $1.20 million. He was bothered by nagging injuries in training camp; consequently, he failed to see a lot of action on the field.\n\nLee earned NFL Defensive Player of the Week and Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week honors for his Week 14 performance versus Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts, in which he recorded the first two interceptions of his NFL career, including one he returned for a touchdown and one in overtime to set up the game-winning field goal.\n\n### 2011 season"
