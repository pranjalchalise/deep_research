      "snippet": "Yesterday I spent a good amount of time on X (formerly Twitter) which is a surefire way to be exposed to horrible and terrible things happening in the world. I am particularly bothered by the egregious and willfully dishonest clipping of and taking quotes out of context to paint people as saying something very obviously different than what they are saying if one watches it in context. I put a lot of time and effort into trying to correct people, add the context, post a Community Note about it. The results were dismal – people that already saw it, saw it, and every person that engaged with me pushing back and maintaining the dishonesty, none of them change their opinions about it at all, even when presented with the clear, unmistakable facts. [...] It seems to mostly be out of my system now as I redirect my energy back to going further towards actuality. This is clearly the best way to actually make an impact on the world – by being that, and writing from that place, and then what I write may attract people which may go viral (perhaps), but that part is not up to me, all I can do is put it out into the world – and very obviously, the most impactful way to spend that energy is firstly to become free myself, and secondly to put that energy into the current active participants here, to help in whatever way that might help (which will be greatly aided by the most-impactful thing).\n\nPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled [...] It made it starkly clear that this is not an alternative to actual freedom. Going out and spending energy essentially being an activist – it just doesn’t work. It is a tiny drop in the bucket, one feeling-beings contribution to a site with hundreds of millions of feeling-beings all fervently participating on it. Even if I had millions of followers – there are posters who do have millions of followers, and their replies are filled by people that vehemently disagree with them. One simply cannot control other people, it doesn’t work."

      "snippet": "subsuming itself into the whole. Since one is selfish by ones created nature, I will sustain the community  the whole  which is more selfish than me, in conjunction with all the other similarly afflicted bodies. This process is inevitable so long as I exist. Consequently, the conundrum which all citizens are faced with is dissolved with my demise. Astonishingly, I find that \\social change is unnecessary\\; I can live freely in the community as-it-is. I do not subscribe to that ridiculous hyperbole that the community acts for the good of the whole for I see directly and with clarity. I know that there is no whole outside of passionate human imagination. The community actually exists for the good of me  and for the good of all other individuals  without ever realising [...] duty, obligation and responsibility  one can then chastise oneself, thus maintaining ones sense of being a social identity. With suitable remorse, one has then been coerced, cajoled and shamed into having ones usefulness to the community restored ... and one feels needed again. Nonetheless, one is actually crazy to chastise oneself because I am selfish by my very created nature ... and I will always be self-centred. Self-castigation only serves to crystallise me. It is essential to the communitys well-being that I remain selfish. Because the whole, having created me so as to perpetuate its own existence  and being utterly selfish itself  desperately needs self-centred members. I readily invest, morally, in the community for there one recognises ones ilk ... I am [...] over my  perceived to be insignificant  personal needs. Because of a continuous supply of citizens, the whole does not need me as much as I need it. Thus the community always has the upper hand and can do with me, virtually, whatever it wants. There is a constant power-battle going on between me and the whole ... which one must invariably lose, in order to cultivate and nurture ones invisible Spirit. The community dangerously wants one to have a Spirit, for it requires a consistent reserve of supplicating selves prepared to sacrifice themselves in the name of the Good of the whole. The community coopts the word we and turns it back into the whole to serve its own nefarious purposes.  \\  Not surprisingly none of these shenanigans, deemed necessary by everyone, are"

In fact, AUR is the first political party to put these issues on the public agenda, from a different perspective than that supported by Brussels today.\n\nIf the society is divided, this is not because of the AUR party, but because of those elusive measures and policies promoted by the globalist elite and its lobbyists. [...] Claudiu Trziu: As I said, this trend is growing everywhere in Europe. This is a historic and defining moment, and the outcome of the next European elections will be decisive for evolution of the EU.\n\nI believe not only that this change is possible, but that it is absolutely necessary if we want to revive Europe on the foundations on which it was built. The change of majority in the European Parliament will also lead to a change in the composition of the Commission.\n\nWe, the AUR, are fully aware of the sensitivities and even animosities between certain conservative parties that would make unity at European level almost impossible. However, we are of the opinion that bilateral differences should remain in the background and that we should try to find a solution to them later."
