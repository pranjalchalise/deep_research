      "snippet": "# What is LangChain?\n\nLangChain is an open-source orchestration framework that simplifies building applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and components to connect LLMs with various data sources, enabling the creation of complex, multi-step workflows.\n\nAvailable as libraries in Python and JavaScript, LangChain helps developers enhance LLM capabilities beyond text generation by linking them to external data and computation. This helps facilitate the development of advanced AI applications like intelligent chatbots, sophisticated question-answering systems, and automated data analysis tools.\n\nGet started for free\n\nBuild AI-powered apps on Vertex AI with LangChain\n\n# LangChain and AI [...] ## How does LangChain work?\n\nLangChain works by \"chaining\" together different components to create a cohesive workflow for LLM-powered applications. This modular approach breaks down complex language-based AI systems into reusable parts. When a user submits a query, LangChain can process this input through a series of steps.\n\nFor example, a typical workflow might involve: [...] This chaining approach lets developers define a sequence of actions their application will take to handle a user's request and create a response. By simplifying these steps into components, LangChain makes it easier to build applications that need multiple interactions with an LLM or external resources. The framework also offers ways to work with different LLMs, giving developers the freedom to choose the best model for their specific application.\n\nLearn more about how you can use LangChain with Vertex AI.\n\n## Key features of LangChain\n\nLangChain provides a suite of features designed to facilitate the development of LLM-powered applications. These features are organized around core concepts that help manage interactions with models, connect to data, and orchestrate complex behaviors."

      "snippet": "LangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response. [...] Launched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI (genAI) more accessible to enthusiasts and startups in the wake of its widespread popularity. Advancements in accessibility for agentic AI are currently enabling a revolution in automation.\n\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even AI agents capable of robotic process automation.\n\n### Integrations with LLMs [...] LangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\n### Importing language models"
