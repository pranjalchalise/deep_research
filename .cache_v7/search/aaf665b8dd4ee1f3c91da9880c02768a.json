      "snippet": "The ethical integration of AI in health care and public health presents both challenges and opportunities. For example, AI can potentially streamline workflows and enhance diagnostic accuracy, but it also raises issues such as the potential for dehumanization in care and reduced patient–provider interactions (17). By addressing these ethical considerations proactively, working partners in public health and medicine can leverage AI to improve population health and health care outcomes while maintaining a commitment to ethical practice. As we delve into the transformative potential of AI in public health and medicine, it becomes increasingly apparent that while AI offers substantial benefits for health care efficiency and effectiveness, it also introduces substantial ethical and equity [...] The potential of AI to transform public health and medicine is immense. Yet, as health professionals harness these technologies, they must also consider the implications on health equity and ethical practices. Health equity in the context of AI applications refers to the fair and just distribution of health technologies and their benefits (8). It ensures that all individuals have access to the same high-quality health care services, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, sex or gender, ethnicity, disability status, or geographic location (8). The deployment of AI diagnostic tools for diabetic retinopathy primarily in well-resourced health care settings or among populations with insurance coverage exemplifies an unfair distribution of technology. This approach disproportionately [...] AI’s potential to transform health is immense, from improving diagnostic accuracy to personalizing treatment plans and predicting disease trends (2). Yet, as we stand on the brink of this technological revolution, it is crucial to address the ethical implications and ensure that these advancements benefit all sections of society equitably. The misuse or unethical application of AI can lead to increased disparities and further exacerbate adverse outcomes for socially and economically disadvantaged populations."
