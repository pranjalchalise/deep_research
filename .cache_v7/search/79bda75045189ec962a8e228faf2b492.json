      "snippet": "Born into the epicenter of the struggles of power. Marius grew tired of the endless scheming and politics. It's an unescapable masquerade ball, and all Marius hopes for is for him to never find his ball partner and let him be the only one that gets sucked into this bottomless abyss.\n\n## Background\n\nMarius von Hagen is the second son of Austin von Hagen, the head of the family.\n\nHaving an elite education and passion for the fine arts, Marius was admitted to the world's top art school, Florence College of Art, where he majored in oil painting. In 2029, Marius graduated with a bachelor's degree ahead of time and returned to Stellis to take over the Pax Group as its CEO. [...] ## Appearance\n\nMarius is a tall young man with purple-toned hair, purple eyes, and fair skin. He is typically seen wearing several piercings, a black logo t-shirt, a white button-down overshirt and denim pants. He wears two necklaces, the foremost visible one being a dog tag inscribed with the letter \"Z\" and a pendant necklace hidden under his shirt.\n\n## Personality\n\nHeir to a global corporation who yearns for freedom.\nAn heir to a massive corporation whose ways are always out of the ordinary, and who never follow the rules.\n\nMarius has a carefree and rebellious playboy public image, all to hide his true self. This is also the reason why the public doubts whether he is capable of inheriting and leading such a vast family corporation."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career"

He won\nhis second consulship in 104 B.C., and shortly afterward achieved great renown\nfor defeating the Teutone and Cimbri invaders in northern Italy.\nThese victories brought him great\npopularity with both the people of Rome, and the army, and he was elected consul five years in\nsuccession, from 104 to 100 B.C., an unprecedented run. During this period he\nreorganized the army, an achievement that laid the ground work for the Roman legions of imperial\ndays.

      "snippet": "Share\n\nUpon winning the Social War, Sulla became Rome’s consul in 88 BC. Unlike Marius, Sulla came from an aristocratic background. Although he frequented the company of lower-class dancers and actors, Sulla was determined to restore the wealth and privilege of his noble family. Sulla’s ego clashed with that of Marius, setting the stage for civil war in Rome. Marius still enjoyed a greater reputation, so Sulla needed to find his own military glory. [...] So who was Gaius Marius?\n\nHumble origins\n\nMarius started out in an equestrian family which, despite relative affluence, remained outside of Rome’s snobbish aristocracy. He married into a rich family, which gave him the political patronage he needed to become a tribune in 119 BC and a praetor in 115 BC. Serving as a governor in one of Rome’s Spanish provinces, Marius gained priceless military experience from his counter-insurgency campaigns against Rome’s tribal enemies. Carefully and meticulously, the Roman governor studied the hit-and-run tactics of his foes, allowing him to master the art of conquest. [...] Marius further distinguished himself by serving as a junior military officer in the Jugurthine War in 109 BC. Exploiting his military prestige, the unorthodox Marius broke from tradition by running for the consulship in 107 BC. To bolster his electoral prospects, Marius presented himself as a true man of the people. He styled himself as a populist, whose personal competence and merit outshone the arbitrary privileges of Rome’s archaic aristocracy. “They may look down on my humble origins,” the gruff general remarked of Rome’s aristocrats, “but I have nothing but disdain for their idleness.”\n\nShare"

      "snippet": "## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarius was an extremely successful Roman general and politician. In ancient sources, he has been repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism. Plutarch says of him:\n\n> if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age. [...] After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate [...] During the winter of 109 and 108 BC, a detachment of Roman soldiers serving as the garrison of Vaga \"Vaga (Tunisia)\") was ambushed and cut down almost to a man. The garrison commander, one Titus Turpilius Silanus, a client of Metellus, escaped unharmed. Marius allegedly urged Metellus to sentence Silanus to death on charges of cowardice, but then turned on Metellus, arguing that the sentence was disproportionate and overly harsh. Marius also sent letters back to Rome claiming that Metellus had become enamoured with the unlimited powers associated with his imperium. Metellus, wary of an increasingly disgruntled and resentful subordinate, permitted Marius to return to Rome. According to Plutarch, he returned with barely enough time to make it back for the consular elections; but according"
