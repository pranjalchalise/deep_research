      "snippet": "The paper introduces an innovative strategy for managing multi-agent systems (MASs) within autonomic computing. It focuses on leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-based models, to enhance the adaptability and communication among agents. The study presents a new architectural framework based on the MAPE-K model, facilitating dynamic adaptation of systems. The proposed model was tested using a marketplace simulation, where autonomous agents demonstrated decision-making and adaptive behaviors using embedded LLMs. Future work aims to assign individual OpenAI accounts to each agent and explore additional real-world scenarios. The findings suggest a paradigm shift in how MASs can become more self- adaptive through LLM integration, opening up new research avenues for complex [...] 21. Patil, Dinesh D., Dhanraj R.
