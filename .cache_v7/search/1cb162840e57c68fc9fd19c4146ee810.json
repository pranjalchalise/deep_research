Naturopaths favor a holistic approach with non-invasive treatment and generally avoid the use of surgery and drugs. Naturopathic philosophy is based on a belief in vitalism and self-healing, and practitioners often prefer methods of treatment that are not compatible with evidence-based medicine. Naturopathic medicine is replete with pseudoscientific, ineffective, unethical, and possibly dangerous practices.\"\n\nNot only is he putting himself in danger, but by opting for this pseudoscientific crap, he is drawing others into it. Kindly outrage."

      "snippet": "I'm genuinely trying to understand what's happening with the Kejriwal case. For months we kept hearing about the liquor policy investigation, arrests, and accusations and the impression given was that he was definitely guilty. The government has so many agencies and so many resources, so if there was solid proof, why hasn’t it led to a clear conviction? Now he’s out and moving freely again. So what should people assume? Was it really a strong case, or was it more of a political move timed around elections? It feels like during election season, every party paints the other as criminals to influence voters, and once elections end, everything suddenly becomes quiet. Why do people still fall for these tactics every single time? Is it because of media narratives, or do we just forget too [...] Is it because of media narratives, or do we just forget too quickly? Would love to hear others' perspectives ,not trying to start a fight, just trying to understand. [...] r/delhi icon\n\n# Was the Kejriwal case real or just election-time politics?"

No big statements, no major public appearances, and barely any media buzz. For a leader once known for dominating headlines, his absence is hard to miss.\n\nIs this just a strategic retreat, or is something brewing behind the scenes?\n\n# Related Answers Section\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community"
