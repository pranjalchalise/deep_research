      "snippet": "The Amortized Cost data set, also includes all usage records, Marketplace and Microsoft 365 purchases. However, the commitment-based purchases do not appear directly because their costs are amortized and applied to the usage where the benefit is consumed. As a result, the same usage that appears with zero costs in Actual Cost, shows charges in the Amortized Cost dataset. The Amortized Cost data set doesn't match your invoice, since it reflects amortized allocations rather than billed amounts.\n\n  Learn more about amortized costs here View amortized benefit costs. [...] Billing account - Represents an EA enrollment and is the scope at which invoices are generated. All purchase and usage charges are visible in this scope in both the Actual and Amortized Cost datasets, with some important distinctions.\n\n  The Actual Cost dataset includes all meter-emitted usage charges from Azure, Marketplace and Microsoft 365 offers. It also includes purchases from Marketplace and Microsoft 365, as well as commitment-based benefits (reservations and savings plans). The benefit offsets the charges, so usage records covered by a commitment appear with zero costs."

      "snippet": "Amortized cost breaks down reservation purchases into daily chunks and spreads them over the duration of the reservation term. Most reservation terms are one or three years. Let's look at a one-year reservation example. Instead of seeing a $365 purchase on January 1, you'll see a $1.00 purchase every day from January 1 to December 31. In addition to basic amortization, these costs are also reallocated and associated by using the specific resources that used the reservation. For example, if that $1.00 daily charge was split between two virtual machines, you'd see two $0.50 charges for the day. If part of the reservation isn't utilized for the day, you'd see one $0.50 charge associated with the applicable virtual machine and another $0.50 charge with a charge type of UnusedReservation. [...] If you buy a one-year reservation on May 26 with an upfront payment, the amortized cost is divided by 365 (assuming it's not a leap year) and spread from May 26 through May 25 of the next year. If you pay monthly, the monthly fee is divided by the number of days in that month. The free is spread evenly across May 26 through June 25, with the next month's fee spread across June 26 through July 25. [...] ## Switch between actual and amortized cost\n\nBy default, Cost Analysis shows all usage and purchase costs as they get accrued and appear on your invoice, also known as Actual cost. Viewing actual cost is ideal for reconciling your invoice. However, purchase spikes in cost can be alarming when you're keeping an eye out for spending anomalies and other changes in cost. To flatten out spikes caused by reservation purchase costs, switch to Amortized cost."

      "snippet": "Amortized costs: This cost metric reflects the effective cost of the upfront and monthly reservation fees spread across the billing period. By default, Cost Explorer shows the fees for Reserved Instances as a spike on the day that you're charged. However, if you choose to show costs as amortized costs, the costs are amortized over the billing period. This means that the costs are broken out into the effective daily rate. AWS estimates your amortized costs by combining your unblended costs with the amortized portion of your upfront and recurring reservation fees. For the daily view, Cost Explorer shows the unused portion of your upfront reservation fees and recurring RI charges on the first of the month. [...] Amortized costs aren't available for billing periods before 2018. If you want to see how much of your reservation was unused, group by purchase option.\n    Blended costs: This cost metric reflects the average cost of usage across the consolidated billing family. If you use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations, you can view costs using blended rates. For more information, see Blended Rates and Costs.\n    Net unblended costs: This cost metric reflects the cost after discounts.\n    Net amortized costs: This cost metric amortizes the upfront and monthly reservation fees while including discounts such as RI volume discounts.\n4. Under Additional data settings, select from the following: [...] For example, suppose that Alejandro purchases a Partial Upfront `t2.micro` RI for a one-year term at $30 dollars upfront. The monthly fee is $2.48. Cost Explorer shows the costs for this RI as a spike on the first of the month. If Alejandro chooses Amortized costs for a 30-day month, the Cost Explorer chart shows a daily effective rate of $0.165. This is the EC2 effective rate multiplied by the number of hours in a day."

In the previous example, you can use Cost Explorer for an amortized view of your Savings Plan. A one-year, all-upfront Savings Plan purchase will be spread evenly across the 12 months of the commitment term. Use amortized costs to gain insight into the eﬀective daily costs associated with your portfolio of reservations or Savings Plans.\nAWS service grouping With billing data, your AWS charges are grouped into AWS services on your invoice. To help with deep-dive analysis, Cost Explorer will group some costs diﬀerently. [...] Amortized costs Billing data is always presented on a cash basis. It represents the amount that AWS charges you each month. For example, if you purchase a one-year, all-upfront Savings Plan in September, AWS will charge you the full cost for that Savings Plan in the September billing period. Your billing data will then include the full cost of that Savings Plan in September. This helps you understand, validate, and pay your AWS invoices on time.

It helps you know the monetary value of savings plan consumption by a subscription, resource group or a resource, and can help you charge back for the savings plan utilization internally. The dataset also has unused hours in the savings plan that have been charged for the hourly commitment amount. The dataset doesn't have savings plan purchase records.\n\nThe following fields in the Azure cost data that are relevant to savings plan scenarios. [...] ### Chargeback for a savings plan\n\nYou can charge back savings plan use to other organizations by subscription, resource groups, or tags. Amortized cost data provides monetary value of a savings plan's utilization at the following data types:\n\n Resources (such as a VM)\n Resource group\n Tags\n Subscription\n\n### Determine savings resulting from savings plan\n\nGet the Amortized costs data and filter the data for a `PricingModel` = `SavingsPlan`. Then: [...] ### Get underutilized savings plan quantity and costs\n\nGet Amortized Cost data and filter for `ChargeType` = `UnusedSavingsPlan` and `PricingModel` = `SavingsPlan`.

      "snippet": "Amortized cost - Shows a reservation purchase spread as an amortized cost over the duration of the reservation term. Using the same example above, Cost Analysis shows a varying cost for each month throughout the year, because of the varying number of days in a month. If you group costs by VM in this example, you'd see cost attributed to each VM that received the reservation benefit.\n\n## View your reservation utilization\n\nAfter you buy a reservation, it's important to track its utilization so that you get what you paid for. For example, if you bought 10 VMs for a year and only use five of them, then essentially half of the purchase is wasted. There are two different ways to assess your utilization:\n\n### View unused RI costs in Cost Analysis [...] 1. In the Azure portal, navigate to Cost Analysis for your scope. For example, Cost Management + Billing > Cost Management > Cost Analysis.\n2. Add a filter for Pricing Model: Reservation.\n3. Under Scope and next to the cost shown, select the down arrow symbol, select either Actual cost or Amortized cost metric.\n\nEach metric affects how data is shown for your reservation charges.\n\nActual cost - Shows the purchase as it appears on your bill. For example, if you bought a one-year reservation for $1200 in January, Cost Analysis shows a $1200 cost in the month of January for the reservation. It doesn't show a reservation cost for other months of the year. If you group your actual costs by VM, then a VM that received the reservation benefit for a given month would have zero cost for the month. [...] ## View your reservation charges\n\nReserved instances provide a way for you to save money with Azure. With reservations, you spend money up front for a given number of resources over time. Cost Analysis shows the charges as they appear on your bill. The charges are shown as actual costs or amortized over the course of your reservation period.\n\nNote\n\nAlthough you can buy a reservation with a pay-as-you-go (MS-AZR-0003P) subscription, Cost Analysis doesn't support viewing amortized reservation costs. If you try to view costs with the Amortized cost metric, you'll see the same results as Actual Cost."
