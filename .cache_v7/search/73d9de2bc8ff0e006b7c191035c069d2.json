      "snippet": "The Alex Lee family of companies includes Lowes Foods, Kj's Market, Merchants Distributors, W. Lee Flowers, Souto Foods, and Import Mex. Alex Lee grew out of Merchants Produce Company, which was founded in 1931 by Alex and Lee George. Alex and Lee were generous people who cared about both friends and strangers. Alex George, the entrepreneur, knew everyone's name and directed the warehouse operations. Lee George, the negotiator, was adept at procurement and sales, but was best known for his kindness. Their integrity, honesty, fairness, and loyalty earned them wide trust and great respect among both customers and employees. Alex and Lee believed in customer service and guided the company through good and bad times by focusing on how they could best serve the customer. [...] Image 6: MDI logo\n\nImage 7: MDI background\n\nMDI\n\nMerchants Distributors (MDI) is a wholesale grocery distributor located in Hickory, N.C. It serves over 600 independent retailers across 12 states along the East Coast, as well as exports to over 20 countries. MDI supplies over 40,000 food and non-food products, along with providing comprehensive grocery retail services.\n\nFounded in 1931 as a small family business by brothers Alex and Lee George, MDI’s success and sustained growth stems from the long-held belief that for the company to be successful, its customers and suppliers must also be successful. Our purpose is to serve our independent retailers by equipping them with all the tools, expertise, and network they need to thrive and grow. [...] The tradition started by the two brothers continues today at the Alex Lee family of companies. Each of the Alex Lee companies has grown tremendously over the years by remaining committed to doing what's right for the customer.\n\nImage 2: lowes logo\n\nImage 3: lowes background\n\nLowes Foods\n\nLowes Foods is a grocery retailer with stores located throughout the Carolinas and Georgia. Founded as a single store in 1954 in North Wilkesboro, N.C., Lowes Foods now has over 80 locations. Despite our growth, we weave “local” into everything we do. We work with area farmers and manufacturers because we want our communities to flourish. We care about local because we are local."

He also invested in Branson Hills, a 1,400-acre housing development.\n\nIn 1993, he had joined the board of MGM Grand, led by his friend Kirk Kerkorian. He started a merchant bank to fund ventures in the gaming industry, which he called \"the fastest-growing business in the world\". In 1995, he sold his interests in several Indian gaming projects to Full House Resorts, a casino operator led by his friend Allen Paulson, becoming a major shareholder and later a member of the board of directors. [...] Following the death of Iacocca's wife Mary from type 1 diabetes, he became an active supporter of research for the disease. He was one of the main patrons of the research of Denise Faustman at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 2000, Iacocca founded Olivio Premium Products, which manufactures the Olivio line of food products made from olive oil. He donated all profits from the company to type 1 diabetes research. In 2004, Iacocca launched Join Lee Now, a national grassroots campaign, to bring Faustman's research to human clinical trials in 2006.\n\nIacocca was an advocate of \"Nourish the Children\", an initiative of Nu Skin Enterprises, since its inception in 2002, and served as its chairman.
