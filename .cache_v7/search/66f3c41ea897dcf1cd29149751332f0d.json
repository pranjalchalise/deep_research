It also does not show comprehension of what matters in this text.\n\nWho: the kid and the father\n\nWhat: watching\n\nWhere: ???\n\nWhen:  ???\n\nWhy: ???\n\nSpecific detail: The son spied on his father while he was eating and described him as a fat and sleepy stranger.\n\nThis is a longer sentence because more explanation was given about the event, more detail about what happened.

General detail often only addresses one or a few of these. However, it is a bit more complicated than that. The best way to explain this concept is through an example.\n\nExcerpt from “The Kitten” (Wright, 1967): [...] We have also addressed the Who: Son and father\n\nWhat: Watching father eat\n\nWhere: In the kitchen\n\nWhen: in the day time\n\nWhy: Because the son feels like his father is a stranger and wants to observe and understand him.\n\nAs an English teacher, when I ask my students to give specific details, what I am really asking is for them to show me just how deeply they understand what is happening in the text. Did they notice the ugly language used to describe the father (fat, belched, slumped) did they notice that the son was 'lurking' (spying on his father) did they notice that all of this shows that the son feels like he doesn't really know his own father and kind of sees him in a negative way?\n\nI hope that helps\n\nUpvote • 0   Downvote \n\nAdd comment\n\nMore\n\nReport"

Your opening paragraph should begin with a general statement, then add details that explain it. The details should become increasingly more specific. The pattern ends with a broad statement drawn from your thinking that resulted from the details.\n\n1. Example One\n2. Example Two\n\nNotice how the author of the example below, Gabriel Winant, uses progressions from general to specific to introduce his subject and move his argument forward. [...] Of all the social policy reforms to emerge from the New Deal, Social Security has proven the most far-reaching and enduring, at least in its direct effects. The program drastically reorganized the normative American life course—in turn leaving a lasting imprint on American politics and resisting challenges decades after its passage. Why did old age in particular prove so amenable to such thoroughgoing social intervention in the 1930s—such that Social Security became the flagship program of the New Deal coalition (Winant, 2021, p. 75)?\n\nThe example above begins with a general statement about the impact of Social Security. Then, the author begins to add details about the nature of that impact, ending the paragraph by asking a question about the one, main feature of Social Security.

      "snippet": "Understanding the significance of your study\n\nYour readers may have much less interest than you do in the specific details of your research methods and measures. Many readers will scan your article to learn how your findings might apply to them and their own research.\n\n### Different types of significance\n\nYour findings may have different types of significance, relevant to different populations or fields of study for different reasons. You can emphasize your work’s statistical, clinical, or practical significance. Editors or reviewers in the social sciences might also evaluate your work’s social or political significance.\n\nStatistical significance means that the results are unlikely to have occurred randomly. Instead, it implies a true cause-and-effect relationship. [...] “Such simultaneous heatwaves are 7 times more likely now than 40 years ago. They are also hotter and affect a larger area. Their increasing occurrence is mainly driven by warming baseline temperatures due to global heating, but changes in weather patterns contribute to disproportionate increases over parts of Europe, the eastern United States, and Asia.\n\n5. Relate your study’s impact to the broader context, starting with its general significance to society—then, when possible, move to the particular as you name specific applications of your research findings. (Our example lacks this second level of application.)\n\n“Better understanding the drivers of weather pattern changes is therefore important for understanding future concurrent heatwave characteristics and their impacts.” [...] Depending upon the specific journal or funding agency’s requirements, your statement may be around 100 words and answer these questions:\n\n1. What’s the purpose of this research?\n\n2. What are its key findings?\n\n3. Why do they matter?\n\n4. Who benefits from the research results?\n\nReaders will want to know: “What is interesting or important about this research?” Keep asking yourself that question.\n\n## Where to place the significance statement in your manuscript\n\nMost journals ask you to place the significance statement before or after the abstract, so check with each journal’s guide."

Perhaps the best way to achieve this is by following the CARS Model outlined below.\nThe Create a Research Space (CARS) Model The CARS Model was established by John Swales to describe the process scholars use to give context to their research with three progressive steps. Following these steps will result in a strong introduction that tells the reader why your research is important. [...] Source: Phillips C., Lipman G., Gugelmann H, Doering K., & Lung D., “Snakebites and climate change in California, 1997-2017,” Clinical Toxicology, 2019.\nNotice the author’s use of general to specific as they guided the reader to their focused research hypothesis. This article uses quantitative data and statistics to provide background information and context, but it also ties in the human experience by mentioning the health impacts and cost of snakebites. Compare this quantitative approach to the qualitative example below, observing any similarities and differences. [...] How Does an Introduction Differ from a Literature Review?\nWhile the introduction often includes a brief overview of the important research on your topic, it should not be overly specific when discussing the literature. Instead, it also introduces your research question(s), purpose, objectives, or hypotheses. The literature review, however, critically evaluates the existing research in greater detail, summarizing and synthesizing important articles. The literature review is thorough in discussing subtopics that may be organized chronologically, thematically, or methodologically. The literature review often comes immediately after the introduction. Depending on the academic journal, the two can sometimes Introduction Section for Research Papers, Winter 2023."

      "snippet": "Background information places the research problem within specific contexts; the review of the literature locates the problem within the domain of prior research. Background information is intended to provide the reader with information about the topic being studied, such as, highlighting and expanding upon foundational studies conducted in the past, describing important historical events that inform why and in what ways the research problem exists, defining key components of your study [concepts, people, places, phenomena], and/or placing the research problem within a particular context [see above]. Although background information can be blended into the literature review portion of the paper, essential background information should not be considered a substitute for a comprehensive [...] Cultural -- placed within the learned behavior of a specific group or groups of people.\n Economic -- of or relating to systems of production and management of material wealth and/or business activities.\n Gender -- located within the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with being self-identified as male, female, or another form of gender expression.\n Historical -- the time in which something takes place or was created and how the condition of time influences how you interpret it.\n Interdisciplinary -- explanation of theories, concepts, ideas, or methodologies borrowed from other disciplines applied to the research problem rooted in a discipline other than the discipline where your paper resides. [...] From another perspective, the length and detail of background information also depends on the degree to which you need to demonstrate to your professor how much you understand the research problem. Keep this in mind because providing pertinent background information can be an effective way to demonstrate that you have a clear grasp of key issues, debates, and concepts related to your overall study."
