      "snippet": "Robert Charles Sproul (/sproʊl/ SPROHL; February 13, 1939 – December 14, 2017) was an American Reformed theologian, Christian apologist, and ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America. He was the founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, and could be heard daily on the Renewing Your Mind radio broadcast internationally. [...] ## Education and personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSproul was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the second child of Robert Cecil Sproul, an accountant and future veteran of World War II, and his wife, Mayre Ann Sproul (née Yardis). Sproul was baptized as a boy at Mount Washington Methodist Church. His family later joined Pleasant Hills Community Church, a congregation of the United Presbyterian Church. He was an avid supporter of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Pirates as a youth, and at the age of 15, he had to drop out from high school athletics in order to support his family. [...] Sproul was a critic of postmodern philosophy. He considered postmodern thinking as a seduction to the church. This seduction originated towards the end of the cultural revolution of the 1960s and produced \"the most narcissistic generation in the history of the human race.\" Sproul saw churches responding to that cultural change by \"adopting the use of sound bites, entertainment, and that sort of thing\" in replacement of using biblical teaching directly. Further, he found that this infiltration of postmodernity led to a \"revival of ancient Gnosticism\" with a \"wide spread rejection of rationality\" within the Christian church. He believed that many churches, as a result of this rejection, now teach that \"biblical revelation is only intelligible by intuition or by a particularly sensitive"

Open SWE monitors GitHub issues. When it gets a new one assigned, it kicks off a multi-agent architecture with a Manager, Planner, and Programmer. It can receive messages from users at any time during the process and incorporate them into the state. Check out the slides for diagrams explaining each agent:  And the code:  I found the takeaways really interesting: \\ Summarization is hard: Especially with code changes that can get quite long, you literally can't send the entire context history to the LLM, and highly detailed old diffs may distract it.

      "snippet": "The 1970s saw the beginning of R.C.’s writing career. The first several titles show the range of his teaching and interests: The Symbol: An Exposition of the Apostles’ Creed (P&R, 1973); The Psychology of Atheism(Bethany, 1974), Discovering the Intimate Marriage(Bethan, 1975), and The Inerrant Word,general editor (Bethany, 1975). He would go on to write or edit over 60 books, including a novel, a biography, and several children’s books. [...] In August of 1961 the Sprouls’ first child, Sherrie, was born, and R.C. enrolled at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, which was affiliated with the mainline United Presbyterian Church in the United States (the largest Presbyterian denomination in America at the time).\n\nDuring seminary, he began taking classes with 47-year-old church history professor John Gerstner (1914–1996), a conservative Calvinist in the progressive school. R.C. was strongly opposed to Reformed theology [...] Robert Charles Sproul—called by his parents R. C. Sproul III—was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on February 13, 1939, the second child of Robert Cecil and Mayre Ann Sproul."

      "snippet": "Dr. Robert Charles Sproul (1939—2017) was an American Presbyterian pastor, theologian, author, apologist, and Bible teacher.  \n  \n R.C. Sproul was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended Westminster College near Pittsburgh on a football scholarship. Although the school was affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), he was not a believer when he enrolled. However, a fellow football player shared the gospel with him, and R.C. came to faith his freshman year. In 1960, a year before graduation, he married Vesta Voorhis, his childhood sweetheart. (At the time of his death, they had been married 57 years.) [...] R.C. Sproul was a staunch defender of biblical inerrancy and helped draft the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy. He was a critic of Roman Catholic theology and objected to the document Evangelicals and Catholics Together, which downplayed the key differences, such as justification by faith alone, between evangelicals and Catholics. [...] Dr. Sproul served on the boards of the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy, Evangelism Explosion, and Prison Fellowship. In 1980, Sproul accepted a position as professor of theology and apologetics at Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi. He traveled there for a few months each year and taught a full load. When RTS opened an Orlando campus, he served as the Senior Chair of Systematic Theology from 1987 to 1995. Sproul then served as Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics at Knox Theological Seminary in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, from 1995 to 2004. In 1997, he founded St. Andrews Chapel in Sanford, Florida (a suburb of Orlando), and in 2011 founded Reformation Bible College, also in Sanford."
