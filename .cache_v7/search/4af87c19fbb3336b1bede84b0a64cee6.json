      "snippet": "In fall 1820, Pierce entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, one of 19 freshmen. He joined the Athenian Society, a progressive literary society, alongside Jonathan Cilley (later elected to Congress) and Nathaniel Hawthorne, with whom he formed lasting friendships. He was the last in his class after two years, but he worked hard to improve his grades and graduated in fifth place in 1824 in a graduating class of 14. John P. Hale enrolled at Bowdoin in Pierce's junior year; he became a political ally of Pierce's and then his rival. Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company called the Bowdoin Cadets during his junior year, which included Cilley and Hawthorne. The unit performed drill on campus near the president's house, until the noise caused him to demand that it halt. The [...] Pierce never lost sight of politics during his travels, commenting regularly on the nation's growing sectional conflict. He insisted that northern abolitionists stand down to avoid a southern secession, writing that the bloodshed of a civil war would \"not be along Mason and Dixon's line merely\", but \"within our own borders in our own streets\". He also criticized New England Protestant ministers, who largely supported abolition and Republican candidates, for their \"heresy and treason\". The rise of the Republican Party forced the Democrats to defend Pierce; during his debates with Republican Senate candidate Abraham Lincoln in 1858, Douglas called the former president \"a man of integrity and honor\". [...] Franklin Pierce was born on November 23, 1804, in a log cabin in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. He was a sixth-generation descendant of Thomas Pierce, who had moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from Norwich, Norfolk, England, in about 1634. His father Benjamin \"Benjamin Pierce (governor)\") was a lieutenant in the American Revolutionary War who moved from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, to Hillsborough after the war, purchasing 50 acres (20 ha) of land. Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife Anna Kendrick; his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth, leaving a daughter. Benjamin was a prominent Democratic-Republican state legislator, farmer, and tavern-keeper. During Pierce's childhood, his father was deeply involved in state politics, while two of"

      "snippet": "Franklin Pierce was born in 1804, the year Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark off to explore America. Pierce was born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire and grew up in a busy house on the second N.H. turnpike. His father was a two-term Governor, and the Pierce house and tavern was a gathering spot for politicians, travellers, and notables. His parents loved to entertain and the ballroom on the second floor could host guests, a dance, or militia training.  Pierce graduated from Bowdoin College with a law degree and then entered politics.  He was married to Jane Appleton Means in 1834, a solemn minister's daughter, who hated politics and spent her life suffering from poor health and the anguish of losing all three of her sons.

      "snippet": "In his thirties, Pierce stopped drinking and joined the temperance movement. He then led a successful drive to outlaw liquor in his new hometown of Concord. He opened a law practice there as well, and with his skill as a public speaker and his local fame, he was an immediate success as a trial lawyer. Courts of law were a prime form of entertainment, and Franklin Pierce was a star in this setting during the 1840s. Citizens from all over New Hampshire fought for a place in his courtrooms, and he seldom disappointed them. Pierce had little interest in the drab bookwork of the law, but he was a master at assessing a jury and then appealing to its emotions. He took high-profile cases and consequently his fame spread. He also remained involved with politics, managing Democrat James K. Polk's [...] Franklin attended local schools until age twelve when he was sent to private academies. At fifteen, he entered Bowdoin College in Maine where he made many friends, including a budding young writer named Nathaniel Hawthorne. At first, young Franklin enjoyed the social life at Bowdoin so much that his schoolwork took second priority. Soon he was last in his class. He gradually began to apply himself to his studies and by graduation in 1824, he ranked fifth in his class.\n\n#### Rapid Rise to National Politics [...] Like most Americans, Pierce remained firmly opposed to the abolition of slavery in the states where it already existed. He also upheld the right of Americans to own property, even human property. And he took Southern positions on the right of Southerners to take slaves into new territories, particularly Kansas. He firmly supported the Compromise of 1850, which included the Fugitive Slave Act, the end of the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and the admission of California as a free state.\n\n### Jean H.

      "snippet": "Born on November 23, 1804 in in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, Pierce attended Bowdoin College. After graduation he studied law, then entered politics. In 1829, he was elected to the New Hampshire legislature; two years later he became its speaker. During the 1830s and 1840s he went to Washington, first as a representative, then as a senator. In 1834, Pierce married Jane Means Appleton, and they had three sons. [...] Pierce had only to make gestures toward expansion to excite the wrath of northerners, who accused him of collaborating with southerners to extend slavery into other areas. Therefore he aroused apprehension when he pressured Great Britain to relinquish its special interests along part of the Central American coast, and even more when he tried to persuade Spain to sell Cuba. [...] Although Pierce only won the popular vote by about 200,000 votes, he received 254 electoral votes to Whig candidate General Winfield Scott’s 42. He appealed to southern and northern Democrats, New Englanders, and even southern Whigs. Two months before he took office, his 11-year-old son Benjamin was killed in a horrific train accident—Ben was the third and final son to die young. Grief stricken and childless, Pierce and his wife Jane struggled to cope with these losses throughout his presidency and for the rest of their lives."
