      "snippet": "## The history of artificial intelligence:\n\nThe idea of “artificial intelligence” goes back thousands of years, to ancient philosophers considering questions of life and death. In ancient times, inventors made things called “automatons” which were mechanical and moved independently of human intervention. The word “automaton” comes from ancient Greek, and means “acting of one’s own will.” One of the earliest records of an automaton comes from 400 BCE and refers to a mechanical pigeon created by a friend of the philosopher Plato. Many years later, one of the most famous automatons was created by Leonardo da Vinci around the year 1495. [...] Skip to main content\n\n# What is the history of artificial intelligence (AI)?\n\nIt may sometimes feel like AI is a recent development in technology. After all, it’s only become mainstream to use in the last several years, right? In reality, the groundwork for AI began in the early 1900s. And although the biggest strides weren’t made until the 1950s, it wouldn’t have been possible without the work of early experts in many different fields.\n\nKnowing the history of AI is important in understanding where AI is now and where it may go in the future. In this article, we cover all the major developments in AI, from the groundwork laid in the early 1900s, to the major strides made in recent years.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover: [...] ### AI maturation: 1957-1979\n\nThe time between when the phrase “artificial intelligence” was created, and the 1980s was a period of both rapid growth and struggle for AI research. The late 1950s through the 1960s was a time of creation. From programming languages that are still in use to this day to books and films that explored the idea of robots, AI became a mainstream idea quickly.\n\nThe 1970s showed similar improvements, such as the first anthropomorphic robot being built in Japan, to the first example of an autonomous vehicle being built by an engineering grad student. However, it was also a time of struggle for AI research, as the U.S. government showed little interest in continuing to fund AI research.\n\nNotable dates include:"

During this period, machines gained the ability to learn from large amounts of data without explicit programming. Key developments included the emergence of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, which enabled significant breakthroughs in the field of AI.\n\nIn 1997, Deep Blue, an IBM machine, defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, marking a milestone in the history of AI. This was one of the first clear examples of a machine outperforming a human in a domain traditionally regarded as a test of intelligence.

This revolution is transforming industries and society as a whole. Below, we explore its evolution, from its initial theoretical concepts to current advancements and its potential future impact.\n\nEarly AI concepts (1940s-1960s) [...] Early AI concepts (1940s-1960s)\n\nAI began as a theoretical discipline in the 1940s, when figures like Alan Turing proposed the possibility that machines could “think”. In 1950, Turing introduced the famous Turing Test, designed to determine whether a machine could mimic human intelligence.\n\nHowever, even before Turing’s contributions, the Spanish inventor Eduardo Torres Quevedo had developed a “chess player” in 1920, capable of playing chess. This invention is considered one of the first intelligent systems. These early achievements laid the foundation for what would later become modern AI."

After that, only mathematicians and scientists gave it much thought. But it’s now playing more prominent roles in the world in ways that were unimaginable in the past. [...] One of the pioneers of intelligent computers was Alan Turing. Often credited with laying the foundational theory for modern computing, he proposed the concept of a machine that could simulate any other machine (the Turing Machine) in the 1930s. His famous Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s, was a fundamental contribution to the field of AI, challenging whether machines could mimic human intelligence. However, it wasn’t until 1955 that John McCarthy founded AI as an academic discipline and called it “artificial intelligence.” He also developed a programming language called LISP in the late 1950s, which became crucial to AI development. [...] Then, in the 2020s, deep learning dominated and reshaped aspects of human life. Even larger datasets enabled deep learning to perform tasks beyond human intelligence, like image recognition. It didn’t stop there. DeepMind’s AlphaFoldAI model, using deep learning on a massive dataset of experiments on protein structures, solved a problem biologists had been tackling for 50+ years.\n\nThe evolution of AI from theoretical exploration to widespread practical application marks one of the most significant technological narratives of the 20th and 21st centuries. The only question remains now:how will AI change the future?\n\n## The Future of Artificial Intelligence"
