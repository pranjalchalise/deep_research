Rose will be the fifth Bull to be honored with a jersey retirement, joining Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Bob Love, and Jerry Sloan.\n\nAs captured by the Chicago Bulls’ X account, Jordan sent a congratulatory message to Rose.\n\n“Derrick, congratulations on the retirement of your jersey. I’m very happy for you. You had an unbelievable career. You really represent the city of Chicago, the Chicago Bulls, your family, and yourself very, very well. I’m very proud of you and very happy for your special night. I’m looking forward to coming to the United Center and seeing your jersey hanging up with my jersey.”"

      "title": "JJ Redick weighs in on the evergreen GOAT debate between Michael Jordan and LeBron James - sportingnews.com",
      "snippet": "\"It’s hard to compare eras and play styles. To me, it's even harder to compare stats. Jordan is 1, LeBron is 1; Jordan is 2, LeBron is 2. However, you want to do it, to me, they’re the two greatest players of all time,\" Redick said about this debate.\n\nOver the past two seasons, Redick has seen James' greatness up close. He has always heard stories about James, but he never got to see him. Now that he's coaching, Redick has even more respect for the 23-year veteran.\n\nHowever, he still has no definitive answer to the GOAT debate. That just shows how great both players are because they continue to elicit that kind of reaction from all types of basketball fans.\n\n## More NBA news: [...] ## More NBA news:\n\n This stat shows a major issue the Lakers need to fix\n Luka Doncic becomes youngest player in NBA history to hit major milestone\n Lakers' Luka Doncic admits 'I don't want to show my body' after playing former Mavericks teammates\n Lakers' trio warned of timeline dilemma like Warriors' Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson\n Lakers' LeBron James sends powerful Luka Doncic admission that hints at future in LA\n\n### Cholo Martin Magsino\n\nCholo Martin Magsino is a freelance writer with The Sporting News. His love for basketball is seen through covering the breaking news, telling in-depth stories about players and analyzing the game. Cholo has previously written for Athlon Sports, Basketball Network, NBA Analysis and Last Word on Sports. [...] He took some time off between the two instances, but he still had a secure legacy. Jordan seemed untouchable at the top of the basketball world, but James entered the league in 2003, and he has been at the top ever since.\n\nMORE: LeBron James' retirement plans get bold prediction from former Lakers guard\n\nWhile it will ultimately come down to preference, these two players have become the best candidates for GOAT status. There are endless arguments about the two players on social media, traditional media, and even in casual conversations.\n\nRedick is an experienced media member, but he is now the coach of the Lakers, who have James as a centerpiece. For Redick, it is still a toss-up between the two megastars."
