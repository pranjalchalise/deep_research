      "snippet": "In 2017 he starred opposite Jackie Chan in the revenge thriller The Foreigner. Brosnan portrayed a powerful Texas rancher in the television series The Son (2017–19). In 2021 he appeared in a diverse range of roles, playing a criminal involved in a gold heist in The Misfits and a suspicious fertility doctor in False Positive. He starred as King Louis XIV in The King’s Daughter (2022) and as a possible criminal mastermind in the action-comedy The Out-Laws (2023); both films were panned by critics. In 2023 he movingly portrayed Artie Crawford, a World War II veteran and recent widower living in Northern Ireland, in the inspirational drama The Last Rifleman (2023).\n\nQuick Facts\n\nIn full:\n:   Pierce Brendan Brosnan\n\nBorn:\n:   May 16, 1953, Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland (age 72) [...] Brosnan’s subsequent movies included the children’s fantasy Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010) and Roman Polanski’s The Ghost Writer (2010), in which he played a former British prime minister accused of war crimes. In 2011 he appeared as a flirtatious businessman in the comedy I Don’t Know How She Does It and as a widowed writer in the TV miniseries Bag of Bones, which was based on a Stephen King novel.\n\n## Later work [...] Brosnan, whose father left home shortly after his birth, was raised by relatives after his mother left to work in England. At age 15 he set out on his own in London to be an actor. He joined a theater group and later studied at the Drama Centre London. He married actress Cassandra Harris, and the two subsequently moved to the United States; he became a U.S. citizen in 2004. Brosnan was soon cast as a charming con man in the NBC television detective series Remington Steele. The show, which premiered in 1982, was a success, and in 1986 he was chosen as the successor to Roger Moore as James Bond—the suave British secret service agent 007 created by novelist Ian Fleming. His NBC contract, however, prevented him from accepting, and Timothy Dalton took the role instead. Remington Steele ended"

      "snippet": "Franklin Pierce (born November 23, 1804, Hillsboro, New Hampshire, U.S.—died October 8, 1869, Concord, New Hampshire) was the 14th president of the United States (1853–57). He failed to deal effectively with the corroding sectional controversy over slavery in the decade preceding the American Civil War (1861–65).\n\n## Early life and career\n\nThe son of a governor of New Hampshire, Benjamin Pierce, and the former Anna Kendrick, Franklin Pierce attended Bowdoin College in Maine, studied law in Northampton, Massachusetts, and was admitted to the bar in 1827. He married Jane Means Appleton, whose father was president of Bowdoin, in 1834. [...] Pierce entered political life in New Hampshire as a Democrat, serving in the state legislature (1829–33), the U.S. House of Representatives (1833–37), and the Senate (1837–42). Handsome, affable, charming, and possessed of a certain superficial brilliance, Pierce made many friends in Congress, but his career there was otherwise undistinguished. He was a devoted supporter of Pres. Andrew Jackson but was continually overshadowed by older and more prominent men on the national scene. Resigning from the Senate for personal reasons, he returned to Concord, where he resumed his law practice and also served as federal district attorney.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nU.S. Presidents and Their Years in Office Quiz [...] At the time of his election, Pierce, age 47, was the youngest man to have been elected to the presidency. Representing the Eastern element of the Democratic Party, which was inclined for the sake of harmony and business prosperity to oppose antislavery agitation and generally to placate Southern opinion, Pierce tried to promote sectional unity by filling his cabinet with extremists from both sides of the slavery debate. He also attempted to sidestep the fierce sectional antagonisms of the domestic scene by ambitiously and aggressively promoting the extension of U.S. territorial and commercial interests abroad. In an effort to buy the island of Cuba from Spain, he ordered the U.S. minister to Spain, Pierre Soulé, to try to secure the influence of European financiers on the Spanish"

      "snippet": "| Franklin Pierce  Franklin Pierce became President at a time of apparent tranquility. The United States, by virtue of the Compromise of 1850, seemed to have weathered its sectional storm. By pursuing the recommendations of southern advisers, Pierce--a New Englander--hoped to prevent still another outbreak of that storm. But his policies, far from preserving calm, hastened the disruption of the Union.  Born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, in 1804, Pierce attended Bowdoin College. After graduation he studied law, then entered politics. At 24 he was elected to the New Hampshire legislature; two years later he became its Speaker. During the 1830's he went to Washington, first as a Representative, then as a Senator.  Pierce, after serving in the Mexican War, was proposed by New Hampshire [...] Pierce won with a narrow margin of popular votes.  Two months before he took office, he and his wife saw their eleven-year-old son killed when their train was wrecked. Grief-stricken, Pierce entered the Presidency nervously exhausted.  In his Inaugural he proclaimed an era of peace and prosperity at home, and vigor in relations with other nations. The United States might have to acquire additional possessions for the sake of its own security, he pointed out, and would not be deterred by \"any timid forebodings of evil.\"  Pierce had only to make gestures toward expansion to excite the wrath of northerners, who accused him of acting as a cat's-paw of Southerners eager to extend slavery into other areas. Therefore he aroused apprehension when he pressured Great Britain to relinquish its [...] |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n ---  ---  --- |"
