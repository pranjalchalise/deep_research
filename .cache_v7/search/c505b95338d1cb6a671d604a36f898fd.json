To achieve this goal, several steps have to take place. First, data needs to be collected and prepared. Then, a training model, or algorithm, needs to be selected. After which, the model needs to be evaluated so that hyperparameter tuning can happen and predictions can be made. It’s also important to note that there are different types of machine learning which include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n## Key Features of Machine Learning [...] Machine learning continues to reshape how we work, live, and innovate, unlocking new possibilities across countless sectors.\n\n## How Machine Learning Models Improve Over Time\n\nMachine learning models refine their predictions and accuracy by continuously learning from new data. The key mechanisms for improvement include:\n\n Retraining with fresh data: As new data becomes available, models are retrained to improve performance.\n Fine-tuning hyperparameters: Adjusting algorithm parameters enhances prediction accuracy.\n Transfer learning: Pre-trained models are adapted to new but related tasks to accelerate learning.\n Eliminating biases: Continuous monitoring ensures models remain fair and accurate over time. [...] Supervised Learning: In this approach, the model is trained using labeled data, where the correct output is already provided. It’s widely used for tasks like classification, such as identifying spam emails.\n Unsupervised Learning: Here, the model works with unlabeled data, discovering patterns and relationships independently. This method is ideal for clustering tasks, like segmenting customers in marketing strategies.\n Reinforcement Learning: This type of learning relies on trial and error, where the model is rewarded for taking desirable actions. It’s commonly applied in fields like robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems.\n\n## How does machine learning work?"

      "snippet": "Types of machine learning\n\nTypes of machine learning\n\n## How Does Machine Learning Work?\n\nWhile the specific approaches taken can vary, most machine learning models follow a similar workflow that starts with gathering data and ends with algorithms that can easily recognize patterns and make predictions as needed. \n\nIt all begins with data collection, where large amounts of information are gathered. The data can be collected from various sources, such as online transactions, customer interactions, sensor readings, medical records, and more. [...] ## What Is Machine Learning?\n\nMachine learning refers to the process by which computers are able to recognize patterns and improve their performance over time without needing to be programmed for every possible scenario. Instead of following a rigid set of rules, these systems analyze data, make predictions, and adjust their approach based on their learning.\n\nThis adapting ability makes machine learning one of the most powerful tools in modern technology. Thanks to it, computers can perform tasks that once required human intuition—like identifying objects in images, understanding spoken language, or detecting fraudulent transactions. [...] Once the data is collected, the data undergoes preprocessing. This step guarantees the information passed to the next stage is clean and structured by eliminating duplicate entries, filling in missing values, standardizing numerical data, and converting categorical variables into a machine-readable format.\n\nWith clean and structured data in hand, model selection and training begins. As stated, the choice of model depends on the specific task, as different algorithms specialize in different types of problems. Training the model involves feeding it data and adjusting its internal parameters so that it learns to make accurate predictions. The more relevant examples it is given, the better it gets at identifying patterns and making decisions."

You can manage your subscriptions or unsubscribe here. Refer to our IBM Privacy Statement for more information.\n\n## How machine learning works\n\nMachine learning works through mathematical logic. The relevant characteristics (or \"features\") of each data point must therefore be expressed numerically, so that the data itself can be fed into a mathematical algorithm that will \"learn\" to map a given input to the desired output. [...] The central premise of machine learning (ML) is that if you optimize a model’s performance on a dataset of tasks that adequately resemble the real-world problems it will be used for—through a process called model training—the model can make accurate predictions on the new data it sees in its ultimate use case.\n\nTraining itself is simply a means to an end: generalization, the translation of strong performance on training data to useful results in real-world scenarios, is the fundamental goal of machine learning. In essence, a trained model is applying patterns it learned from training data to infer the correct output for a real-world task: the deployment of an AI model is therefore called AI inference."

      "snippet": "Instead of relying on rigid pre-defined instructions, ML systems use algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make intelligent decisions. The constant learning process is central to ML, allowing systems to evolve and enhance their performance over time.\n\nMachine learning can be further divided into three primary types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. [...] Supervised learning: The model is trained on labelled data, where the algorithm is provided with inputs and corresponding desired outputs.\n Unsupervised learning: Involves training on unlabelled data, allowing the algorithm to find patterns and relationships independently.\n Reinforcement learning: Introduces the concept of reward-based learning, where the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback.\n\nApplications of AI and machine learning\n\nThe applications of AI and ML span diverse industries, revolutionizing how tasks are performed and problems are addressed. In healthcare, for example, AI is employed for diagnostics, predicting patient outcomes, and drug discovery. [...] E-commerce platforms use ML algorithms for personalized product recommendations, enhancing user experience. Financial institutions utilize AI for fraud detection, risk management, and algorithmic trading. In autonomous vehicles, machine learning enables real-time decision-making based on sensor inputs. The widespread adoption of these technologies is indicative of their versatility and transformative potential."

      "snippet": "But in some cases, writing a program for the machine to follow is time-consuming or impossible, such as training a computer to recognize pictures of different people. While humans can do this task easily, it’s difficult to tell a computer how to do it. Machine learning takes the approach of letting computers learn to program themselves through experience.\n\nMachine learning starts with data — numbers, photos, or text, like bank transactions, pictures of people or even bakery items, repair records, time series data from sensors, or sales reports. The data is gathered and prepared to be used as training data, or the information the machine learning model will be trained on. The more data, the better the program. [...] From there, programmers choose a machine learning model to use, supply the data, and let the computer model train itself to find patterns or make predictions. Over time the human programmer can also tweak the model, including changing its parameters, to help push it toward more accurate results. (Research scientist Janelle Shane’s website AI Weirdness is an entertaining look at how machine learning algorithms learn and how they can get things wrong — as happened when an algorithm tried to generate recipes and created Chocolate Chicken Chicken Cake.)\n\nSome data is held out from the training data to be used as evaluation data, which tests how accurate the machine learning model is when it is shown new data. The result is a model that can be used in the future with different sets of data. [...] ## What is machine learning?\n\nMachine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.\n\nThe goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit “intelligent behaviors” like humans, according to Boris Katz, a principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL. This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language, or perform an action in the physical world."
