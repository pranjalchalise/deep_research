A 15 % failure rate for brace-treated patients compared favourably with 45 % in the observation group. Risser 0–1, apex above T12, and a balanced spine were identified as predictors for curve progression . [...] results of 51 boys with a matched control group of 51 girls treated with a Boston brace, boys showed a significantly higher failure rate (31.4 vs. 21.6 %). Three of the boys but none of the girls had to be operated on. After excluding the non-compliant boys (14/51, 27.5 %), there was no difference in outcome if compared to girls. They conclude that although boys may have more compliance problems there is no reason to abandon bracing . [...] In a retrospective 22-year follow-up study, Danielson and Nachemson reported the radiographic outcome of 127 patients who completed treatment with a Milwaukee or a Boston brace. During treatment, the mean pre-bracing Cobb angle decreased from 33.2 (12–60)° to 29.7 (0–50)°. At final follow-up, it was 37.6 (5–71)°. The mean progression during 22 years after treatment was 7.9 (−7 to 24)°. In 36 % of the patients, progression of more than 10° was registered .\n\nEmans et al.  published a retrospective series of 295 brace-treated patients after a mean follow-up time of 2.4 years. The rate of surgery was 11 % during brace treatment and an additional 1 % after weaning."

For the staff, however, it was time “on.” We would have one group leave, and immediately another group would come through. People often stayed in our homes. We had meals together, and we enjoyed time with them, learning, talking, working, playing sports and games, and studying.\nSD: We had a great sense of community as the staff children. We all lived on the same fifty-acre property for quite some time, and we had wonderful community times. In the summers we had cookouts, and we played softball and volleyball to-gether. We enjoyed that time. [...] “We need to have a place where people can get answers. They don’t have to have the answers themselves to begin with, but we can give them answers so they can give the reasons for their faith.” And so the study center started.

      "snippet": "The note haunted me. My final crisis came in my senior year. I had a three-credit course in the study of Jonathan Edwards. We spent the semester studying Edwards’s most famous book, The Freedom of the Will, under Gerstner’s tutelage. At the same time, I had a Greek exegesis course in the book of Romans. I was the only student in that course, one on one with the New Testament professor. There was nowhere I could hide.\n\nThe combination was too much for me. Gerstner, Edwards, the New Testament professor, and above all the apostle Paul, were too formidable a team for me to withstand.\n\nSproul, the reluctant Calvinst, came to embrace Reformed theology and to view Gerstner as a lifelong theological mentor. [...] Rather than returning to the Netherlands, the Sprouls stayed in the US, where he taught at Gordon College (Massachusetts) and then Conwell School of Theology (Philadelphia). He continued his studies under Berkouwer from a distance and returned in 1969 to take his matriculation exams, which enabled him to receive the “drs.” (doctorandus) degree—equivalent to a masters—which would have enabled him to begin writing a dissertation. But ministry endeavors prevailed, and he never did complete his dissertation and thus did not earn a PhD from Amsterdam. (He would later be granted a PhD from the unaccredited Whitefield Theological Seminary based upon all of his writing for the church.) [...] The Sprouls accepted this calling and in 1971 moved to the small village of Stahlstown, an hour east of Pittsburgh. The Ligonier Valley Study Center was modeled in part after Francis Schaeffer’s L’Abri ministry in Switzerland. Students ate and slept in the Sprouls’ home and the other homes on the complex, while teaching happened both formally and informally throughout the week. A burgeoning audio ministry soon developed, and R.C. began traveling the country giving seminars and conferences."

      "snippet": "#### Transcript\n\nWe are going to continue with our study of Paul’s letter to the church at Rome. We are now in the twelfth chapter, following the first eleven chapters, which were devoted to the content of the gospel. Now, we have the Apostle’s practical application that follows from our understanding of that gospel. Today, I will be reading Romans 12:3–8. I would ask the congregation to stand for the reading of the Word of God: [...] What stood out in the list of compliments was that two out of ten came from the same person: my eighth-grade English teacher. Had this consultant started his analysis not with this exercise but said, “Write down the hundred people who have most influenced you in your life,” I never would have thought to include my eighth-grade English teacher among them. But when he asked for compliments, I included her twice, and the one that first came to my mind took place when I was in the eighth grade. [...] Since then, I have spent much time with pastors from all over the country at pastors’ conferences, and now I have an ability to hear their cries in a way I was not able to before. One of the biggest cries that they make all the time is that they are expected to be a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. They are expected to be administrators. They are expected to be statesmen. They are expected to be psychological counselors. They are expected to be biblical experts, theologians, preachers, teachers, and so on."

      "snippet": "The results further showed (19%) of the respondents were African Traditional Religious believers with the remaining (10%) identified as non-religious. The finding from the study supports literature that the Ghanaian population is highly religious, with Christianity dominating the religious demography of Ghana with an estimated number of over 73% of the total population.47 This finding is essential as it enables the researcher to critically examine the dichotomy between religiosity and health which is the primary focus for this study. The results on the educational background of the respondents also revealed that the majority of the respondents (59%) have had no formal education. Another (29%) of them have first degrees and the remaining (12%) have senior high school (SHS) certificates. [...] 4 7 Meditation 12 21 29 50 14 24 3 5 Discussion Summary The information gathered during the field study is consistent with the opinions expressed in the literature review that spirituality is associated with healing, particularly for those who have been admitted to the hospital. The findings revealed that all the 58 interviewees were one way or the other spiritually inclined even though not all of the respondents identified as religious. The practices of prayer, meditation, listening to music and use of religious emblems are identified as helpful in the healing process. The belief in spirituality and its related activities therefore give meaning to life. Through it, people attain hope and a sense of purpose. Effective exploration of spirituality and healing therefore bridges the gap [...] (21%) were of the view that spirituality means relating to people’s thoughts and beliefs, rather than to their bodies and physical surroundings. The results further indicated that (22%) of the respondents viewed spirituality as relating to or affecting the human spirit or soul as opposed to material or physical things. Finally, the remaining (24%) understood spirituality to also mean the process of making the mind free from fears, worries, and endless thinking, to experience inner peace and bliss in one’s everyday life. The findings indicated different perspectives of the respondents about what constitutes spirituality. This therefore confirms the notion of the complexities surrounding the general understanding of what constitutes spirituality. It is imperative to indicate that the"
