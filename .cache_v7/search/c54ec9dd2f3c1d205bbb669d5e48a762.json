Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages. [...] Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games."

      "snippet": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected \"Garbage collection (computer science)\"). It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. [...] Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution \"Name resolution (programming languages)\") (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n\nPython's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp \"Lisp (programming language)\") tradition\". It has `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets \"Set (mathematics)\"), and generator \"Generator (computer programming)\") expressions. The standard library has two modules (`itertools` and `functools`) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML. [...] Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC \"ABC (programming language)\") programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba \"Amoeba (operating system)\") operating system. Python implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.

      "snippet": "## General Information¶\n\n### What is Python?¶\n\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows. [...] ### What is Python good for?¶\n\nPython is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.\n\nThe language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea of what’s available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult the Python Package Index to find packages of interest to you. [...] ### Is Python a good language for beginning programmers?¶\n\nIt is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students may be better served by learning Python as their first language. Python has a very simple and consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most importantly, using Python in a beginning programming course lets students concentrate on important programming skills such as problem decomposition and data type design. With Python, students can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and procedures. They can probably even work with user-defined objects in their very first course."

It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n\nIt is used for:\n\n web development (server-side),\n software development,\n mathematics,\n system scripting.\n\n### What can Python do?\n\n Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n\n## Why Python? [...] ### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n\n Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n\n### Example\n\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nTry it Yourself »\n\n## Video: Python Introduction\n\n❮ Previous Next ❯\n\n★ +1\n\nSign in to track progress\n\n#### COLOR PICKER\n\nREMOVE ADS\n\nGET CERTIFIED\n\nFOR TEACHERS\n\nCONTACT US; \"Contact us about sales or errors\")\n\n×\n\n## Contact Sales [...] ## Why Python?\n\n Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n\n### Good to know"
