He is also interested in the applications of these tools to empirical problems in policy evaluations. His current research topics include the regression discontinuity design with a mismeasured running variable and the nonparametric additive model with mismeasured covariates.\n\n## Research\n\nEconometrics\n\nPublications\n\n## Teaching\n\nEconometrics\n\n## Search the SMU website\n\n### Search\n\n### Popular Searches\n\n Undergraduate Majors\n Departments\n Connect\n\n## Did you know [...] Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences Department of Economics\n\n# Hao Dong\n\n## Associate Professor\n\nEconomics\n\n|  |  |\n --- |\n| Email | haod@smu.edu |\n| Office Location | Umphrey Lee 301U |\n| Phone | 214-768-3288 |\n| Website |  |\n\n## Education\n\nPh.D. London School of Economics and Political Science, Masters of Economics and Bachelor of Mathematics from Peking University (Beijing, China)\n\n## About [...] ## Did you know\n\nDedman College has an active alumni network with over 10,000 alumni in Dallas County and over 36,000 worldwide."

The long-term goal of his laboratory is to understand the regulatory mechanisms shaping anti-tumor immunity and translate discoveries in cancer immunology into effective cancer immunotherapy. [...] The biochemical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in human immune cells\n   The synergistic effects of combination therapy (chemotherapy or radiation therapy with immunotherapy)\n   The molecular mechanisms in immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity against cancer cells\n   The tumor-intrinsic functions of PD-L1 in tumor biology and resistance to therapy\n\nDr. Dong's translational research is expected to deliver new biomarkers to predict and monitor patient responses to cancer immunotherapy, new therapeutic targets to overcome cancer resistance to immunotherapy, and new rational combined cancer therapy. His research is funded by the National Institutes of Health and Mayo Clinic.\n\n### Focus areas [...] Dr. Dong's early work addressed the Hellstrom paradox — an enigma in cancer immunology — the coexistence of immune cells and growing tumors. He co-discovered B7-H1 (also called PD-L1) in 1998 and was the first to define a role of B7-H1 in cancer immune evasion. And he coined the concept of B7-H1 blockade therapy of cancer in 2002. This discovery provided an explanation for the Hellstrom paradox: Despite being surrounded by immune cells in tissues, cancer cells can escape the immune attack by using B7-H1 in tumor microenvironments to dampen the function of immune cells.\n\nCurrently, the research areas of Dr. Dong's lab are on defining:"

      "snippet": "Main goals of my research are (i) to better understand physical and biogeochemical processes in the marine environments, and (ii) to better delineate the responses of the environment to climate forcing, in various temporal and spatial scales. To achieve these goals I utilize physical and chemical analysis methods, analyze large-scale ocean data, and develop conceptual models. I conduct my research with 3 different spatial scopes: (i) global- to basin-, (ii) regional-, and (iii) local-scales. I measure trace gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the ocean at ultra-trace level as decadal-scale transient tracers of ocean circulation and ventilation processes. This is to understand basin (i.e. Pacific Ocean) to regional (e.g. Gulf of Mexico) scale [...] Sea-going opportunity (closed)\n\nWe are looking for students and early career scientists to participate in each of two legs of a hydrographic cruise across the North Pacific along 30N on the R/V Revelle.
