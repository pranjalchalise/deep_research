With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM's pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data. For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources. [...] ## Process\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating an information-retrieval mechanism that allows models to access and utilize additional data beyond their original training set. Ars Technica notes that \"when new information becomes available, rather than having to retrain the model, all that’s needed is to augment the model’s external knowledge base with the updated information\" (\"augmentation\"). IBM states that \"in the generative phase, the LLM draws from the augmented prompt and its internal representation of its training data to synthesize an engaging answer tailored to the user in that instant\".\n\n### RAG key stages [...] RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don't exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments."

      "snippet": "## Page topics\n\n## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts. [...] ## How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work?\n\nWithout RAG, the LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on—or what it already knows. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. The user query and the relevant information are both given to the LLM. The LLM uses the new knowledge and its training data to create better responses. The following sections provide an overview of the process.\n\n### Create external data [...] Known challenges of LLMs include:\n\nYou can think of the Large Language Model as an over-enthusiastic new employee who refuses to stay informed with current events but will always answer every question with absolute confidence. Unfortunately, such an attitude can negatively impact user trust and is not something you want your chatbots to emulate!\n\nRAG is one approach to solving some of these challenges. It redirects the LLM to retrieve relevant information from authoritative, pre-determined knowledge sources. Organizations have greater control over the generated text output, and users gain insights into how the LLM generates the response.\n\n## What are the benefits of Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\n\nRAG technology brings several benefits to an organization's generative AI efforts."

RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\n\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs. However, training datasets are finite and limited to the information the AI developer can access—public domain works, internet articles, social media content and other publicly accessible data. [...] Standard LLMs source information from their training datasets. RAG adds an information retrieval component to the AI workflow, gathering relevant information and feeding that to the generative AI model to enhance response quality and utility.\n\nRAG systems follow a five-stage process:\n\n1. The user submits a prompt.\n2. The information retrieval model queries the knowledge base for relevant data.\n3. Relevant information is returned from the knowledge base to the integration layer.\n4. The RAG system engineers an augmented prompt to the LLM with enhanced context from the retrieved data.\n5. The LLM generates an output and returns an output to the user.

Sure, technologies like machine translation and abstractive summarization can break down language barriers and lead to some satisfying interactions, but, overall, generating an accurate and reliable response is still a significant challenge.\n\n### 01\n\n## What is retrieval-augmented generation?\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a Generative AI (GenAI) architecture that augments a Large Language Model (LLM) with fresh, trusted data retrieved from authoritative internal knowledge bases and enterprise systems, to generate more informed and reliable responses.

What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a Generative AI (GenAI) framework that augments a Large Language Model (LLM) with fresh, trusted data retrieved from authoritative internal knowledge bases and enterprise systems. RAG generates more informed and reliable responses to LLM prompts, minimizing hallucinations and increasing user trust in GenAI apps.\n\n## 2. What’s the relationship between Generative AI, LLMs, and RAG? [...] The acronym “RAG” is attributed to the 2020 publication, “Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks”, submitted by Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI). The paper describes RAG as “a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe” because it’s meant to connect any LLM with any internal or external knowledge source.\n\nAs its name suggests, retrieval-augmented generation inserts a data retrieval component into the response generation process to enhance the relevance and reliability of the answers."

Once retrieved, the relevant information undergoes pre-processing, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.\n Grounded generation: The pre-processed retrieved information is then seamlessly incorporated into the pre-trained LLM. This integration enhances the LLM's context, providing it with a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. This augmented context enables the LLM to generate more precise, informative, and engaging responses.\n\n## Why use RAG?"

RAG can reshape how software is conceptualized, designed and implemented, ushering in a new era of efficiency and creativity powered by generative models.\n\n## What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a natural language processing (NLP) model that combines two key components: a generator and a retriever.\n\nGenerator: This part creates new content, such as sentences or paragraphs, usually based on large language models (LLMs). [...] Retriever: This part retrieves relevant information from a predetermined set of documents or data.\n\nIn simple terms, RAG uses the retriever to find useful information from a vast collection of texts, and then the generator uses that information to augment its LLM-based training to create new, coherent text. This approach helps improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated content by leveraging new and often more domain-specific knowledge outside of the vast dataset used to train the original LLM. It's commonly used in tasks like answering questions or summarizing text.\n\nRAG integrates these two processes, allowing developers to use a wealth of existing knowledge to augment LLMs to enhance the generation of new, contextually relevant content.\n\n### What does the data look like?"
