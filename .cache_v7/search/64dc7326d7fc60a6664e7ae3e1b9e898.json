      "snippet": "# LEE | Official Theatrical Trailer | In Theaters September 27\n## RoadsideFlix\n100000 subscribers\n21372 likes\n\n### Description\n4294566 views\nPosted: 14 Aug 2024\nLee, the directorial feature from award-winning Cinematographer Ellen Kuras, portrays a pivotal decade in the life of American war correspondent and photographer, Lee Miller (Kate Winslet).  Miller’s singular talent and unbridled tenacity resulted in some of the 20th century's most indelible images of war, including an iconic photo of Miller herself, posing defiantly in Hitler's private bathtub. [...] Miller had a profound understanding and empathy for women and the voiceless victims of war. Her images display both the fragility and ferocity of the human experience. Above all, the film shows how Miller lived her life at full-throttle in pursuit of truth, for which she paid a huge personal price, forcing her to confront a traumatic and deeply buried secret from her childhood. [...] were gonna say. Ready to go? Leave her alone! Bad things do happen to some of us girls. You have secrets, many, that you'll never share. Stop! Stop! Stop! Who cares? Nobody saw them and you didn't print them. I fought for them, Lee! Not hard enough. Go. Even when I wanted to look away, I knew I couldn't. There are different kinds\nof wounds, Not just the ones you\ncan see."

      "snippet": "What most people don’t know about Lee, though, is that he’s been an avid photographer for the past 25 years, pursuing the medium as a creative profession with his photographic works being featured in exhibitions, magazines, and books. He’s also produced and directed music videos for Beck and Midlake, skateboarding films for Stereo Skateboards, and narrative documentaries and short films. In December 2023, Lee opened the analog photo store Eagle Rock Camera & Goods with photographer and friend Raymond Molinar, and the two recently began recording a new podcast about the art and craft of film, photography, and visual art as a whole. [...] Lee became a stalwart of 1990s indie films in collaboration with writer-director Kevin Smith in the cult classics Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma. Lee took on dozens of varied roles throughout the next two decades and had memorable roles in Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky. He’s also done voice-over work throughout his entire career, including in four of the Alvin and the Chipmunks films. [...] “I was so happy to have gotten the part [of Tripp Morgan] because I really wanted this one,” says Lee of playing President Perry Morgan’s younger brother in Shondaland and Netflix’s The Residence, which dropped on March 20. “Everybody knows how incredible Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers projects are, and [Paul [William] Davies]( is a phenomenal writer, and [Uzo [Aduba]]( is an unbelievable actor. Plus, the premise, the tone, the genre — it just felt like it was the right thing to do.”"
