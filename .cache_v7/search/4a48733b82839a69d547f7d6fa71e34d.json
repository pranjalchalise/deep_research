      "snippet": "Evergrande, once a symbol of the country's build-at-all-costs era, collapsed in 2021 under more than $300 billion in debt after Beijing curbed developers' access to easy credit. Its founder, Xu Jiayin, who reportedly sketched the flower-shaped archipelago during a 2011 trip abroad, is now in custody on financial crime charges. Local officials who greenlighted the environmentally dubious project, including Danzhou's former party chief and Hainan's former governor, have been imprisoned for graft. Confidence in real estate has tumbled, with new home sales at their lowest level in more than 15 years. Officials have even begun scrubbing gloomy online commentary about the housing market.
