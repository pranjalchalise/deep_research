This limits the ease and efficiency of application development on such systems. Implementing secondary indexing in a large-scale memory based system is challenging because the goals for low latency, high scalability, consistency and high availability often conflict with each other. This paper shows how a large-scale key-value storage system can be extended to provide [...] whilemaintaining the familiar OpenFlow forwarding model and performing significantly better than alternative techniques for middlebox integration.

Berger, University of Massachusetts Amherst  Presented at SOSP '15: Link to Paper    Improving performance is a central concern for software developers. To locate optimization opportunities, developers rely on software profilers. However, these profilers only report where programs spent their time: optimizing that code may have no impact on performance. Past profilers thus both waste developer time and make it difficult for them to uncover"

However, as an established party with the ability to leverage considerable financial and organizational resources, the BJP emerged as a leader especially in the use of big data and analytics, using a state-of-the-art social media war room to track potential voters across India’s 92,000 villages (Kaul, 2014; Sudhaman, 2014).

This group was composed of graduate students and professionals, mostly in technology-related fields; many of them had taken lengthy sabbaticals from their jobs/academic programs and joined the campaign as early as 2013. The fact that there was only one woman in the sample was not surprising given the gendered nature of Internet use in India, where men account for 71% of Internet users, and women account for just 29%. The gap is only slightly lower in urban India, but there, too, 62% of men use the"
