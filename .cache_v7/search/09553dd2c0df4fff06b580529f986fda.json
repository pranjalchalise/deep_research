      "snippet": "TL;DR\n\nRAG Status is a color-coded system using Red (critical issues), Amber (needs monitoring), and Green (on track) to visualize project health. It helps project managers track key metrics like cost, schedule, scope, and risk in dashboards. Setting clear RAG thresholds and providing context enables faster decision-making and better stakeholder communication.\n\n## What is RAG Status?\n\nRAG Status stands for Red, Amber, and Green. This color-coded system provides a quick visual representation of project health, which is essential for project managers to communicate the current status of projects efficiently.\n\n## RAG Status Meaning [...] ## RAG Status Meaning\n\nThe RAG Status system is a straightforward yet powerful tool used in RAG project management to convey the health of a project. Each color in the RAG Status system carries a specific meaning that should be specific to you. For example: [...] Green: Indicates that the project is on track and progressing as planned. If the project is on budget and on time, it will be marked green. This shows stakeholders that everything is going well and the project goals are being met.  \n  In addition to the primary colors, some organizations use additional colors for more nuanced reporting:‍\n Blue: This color indicates completed tasks. For example, once a project phase is finished and all deliverables are met, it can be marked blue to denote its completion.‍\n Gray: This represents tasks that have not yet started. This helps distinguish between ongoing work and planned activities that have yet to commence."

      "snippet": "RAG status is a way to quickly and visually communicate the status of various aspects of a project or multiple projects. By color-coding the project data, the progress and performance of the project or portfolio are more intuitive and delivered with greater efficiency. It’s a great technique for project managers to get a quick overview of the project, but also serves stakeholders, who want to know the big picture and aren’t interested in the details.\n\nUsing a RAG status facilitates understanding quickly and, in so doing, helps managers and stakeholders to target areas that require attention according to the color that it’s assigned. The red, amber or green also makes it easy to see what is on track and where actions are needed to get the areas in red up to speed. [...] ## What Is RAG Status in Project Management?\n\nAn RAG status is like a KPI traffic light. The RAG stands for red, amber and green. Just like a traffic light, red is an alert, amber (or yellow) signals caution and green means all’s clear. Sometimes another couple of colors are added to the RAG status. That’s blue and gray. Blue indicates that the activity has been completed and gray means there’s an information gap that prevents the status from being correctly assessed. [...] ProjectManager's status report filter\nProjectManager's status report filter\n\n## Manage Resource Utilization and Track Costs\n\nOne area that can show up in the RAG status is the project resources. Being able to manage those resources is going to help keep the project on track. Whether managing one or multiple projects, project managers can turn to real-time dashboards or the color-coded workload chart to make sure their resources are optimally utilized. The team page provides an overview of all projects and team members, including their tasks and the percentage complete they are. The workload chart makes it easy to see who is overallocated so the team’s workload can be balanced to keep them productive and working at capacity."

      "title": "Traffic light rating system - Wikipedia",
      "snippet": "In the British Civil Service and other departments of the United Kingdom government, traffic light colours are used as a coding system for good or bad performance, usually known as a 'RAG rating'—Red, Amber, Green. For example, a red workload performance would mean inadequate, amber would mean reasonable, and green would mean good. The letters R, A and G are used in addition to swatches of colour, so that the system can be used by colour-blind readers.[citation needed]\n\n### Project management\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen status reporting how well a milestone, project, program or portfolio is performing or being delivered, project managers often use a RAG rating to indicate how on track or at risk is the project, its deliverables or tasks \"Task (project management)\")."

Click on the star to select your option. [...] When writing a status report it’s very important to record how a milestone, project, program, or portfolio is performing. Project managers use a RAG rating to indicate if a project is on track or at risk. Green typically indicates normal levels of production, amber indicates that production has slowed (or attention is needed), and red indicates that production has stopped or the line is down.\n\nUsing the RAG rating scale in Team Compass, there are no written rules.

      "snippet": "Many companies tailor the RAG status to their activities, objectives, and tolerance levels, deciding what goes as red, amber, or green.\n\n## The RAG Status color scheme explained:\n\n### Red Status\n\nSimilar to the stop signal used for road traffic systems, in software project management, red suggests a strong need for attention and a high level of risk. A red alarm doesn’t necessarily mean that the project status report is stagnating or the team is not performing; instead, it suggests that the project may shift course if issues are not addressed.\n\nIt can propose that the project is in distress and requires some extra work and demands additional resources, that project risks are escalating, and are threatening the overall deliverables. [...] avatar\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n## Table of contents\n\nSuccessful engineering leaders track, monitor, and plan projects, to ensure they respect their scopes, timelines, and budgets. To do so, tech leads or project managers require complete visibility over the team’s progress and performance and constant access to structured information that is clear and concise.\n\nAn excellent way to access data that can instantly assess the status of an engineering development project is using the RAG scale. The RAG definition in project management involves a convention of colors showcasing each deliverable’s status and raising a signal for the tasks that are not on track. [...] Similarly, the RAG status report is precious in software development projects because it’s a conventional way of attracting tech leaders’ attention to critical elements that may create blockages in the development and delivery cycles. This color convention scheme gives you the RAG meaning, and it helps engineering managers monitor potential risks and address them in time to optimize resources and investments.\n\nIn engineering, the RAG meaning can be applied to everything, from the whole project to a certain workstream and specific issues or risks. When working on complex projects, engineering leaders break them down and apply the RAG color scheme to different pillars, such as schedule, scope, costs, and performance for the project team."
