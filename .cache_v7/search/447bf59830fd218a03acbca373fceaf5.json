He is also the co-founder of Canada's only cybersafety education foundation, KnowledgeFlow. Since 2009, the Foundation has been home to the famous UnHackable brand that empowers Canada's youth to embrace a culture of cybersafety and build a Circle of Trust within their communities. Among other innovations, he is behind the Verify Risk Assessment methodology used by businesses and government agencies across Canada. [...] Claudiu is here today to share this exclusive presentation tailored exclusively to a professional audience but not requiring any technical preparation or expertise, on the emerging threats of new technology, looming risks to our sector and exciting solutions that will give us all a lot more than just a fighting chance: how to gain an unfair advantage in the war on cybercrime.\n\nDesign Director at Volkswagen Group Future Center Europe\n\nDesign Director at Volkswagen Group Future Center Europe\n\nWriter, Media Strategist, Philosopher, Former Director of Marketing at American...\n\nProfessor of Genetic Medicine, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or...\n\nGlobal Futurist and Exponential Thinker, Corporate Innovator, Serial Entrepreneur and...\n\nLeadership Guru, Professor at Harvard Business School [...] Personally, Claudiu is a family man whose four unruly children continue to amaze him by weaponizing critical thinking, making risk-based decisions (in their favour) and generally demonstrating a propensity for bypassing his home security safeguards. His wife Debra is currently the only MBA in the family and therefore significantly more qualified to managing the day-to-day operations of the KnowledgeFlow Foundation by endlessly maximizing scarce resources and collaborating with a nationwide network of amazing professionals and industry associations to push unique initiatives that continue to create hundreds of UnHackable school groups and Cybersafety Champions across Canada."

If you found the episode useful, please spread the word on Twitter mentioning @userlist, or leave us a review on iTunes.\n\n## Key Learnings 💡 [...] ## Key Learnings 💡\n\nIn the early stages of his career, Claudiu became obsessed with a thought that still shapes how he sees things today: how to make web projects that actually impact people’s lives?\n\nHe established his first company at the age of 18 and his main service was creating websites for clients. Around that time, only a few companies had websites set up.\n\nWhen he got to work on the website for the biggest company in their city, Claudiu got very excited. But when he presented the finished website to the client, the CEO was in such a hurry that the meeting became merely transactional: Claudiu was only asked about the cost, he got paid, and that was it. [...] Because he wanted to pursue this question, Claudiu decided to drop out of college to focus on it. At the time, there was no solution addressing the topic and he took it upon himself to learn about it, eventually becoming a usability expert for another company.\n\nAs a usability expert, he got very deep into understanding how people use websites. But as he went deeper, he also got more frustrated because study participants would usually take a long time to learn how to use a website or an application:\n\n“It would take months to find something valuable that you can make a decision based on. And that’s when I discovered data.”\n\nSince then, Claudiu has been on the data-led road because he realized that data gets you faster to insight than anything else."
