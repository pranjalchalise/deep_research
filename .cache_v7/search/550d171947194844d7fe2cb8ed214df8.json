He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy, which was formed from his experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist, and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought. With a career spanning British Hong Kong and the United States, Lee is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema. Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, he is credited with helping to popularize martial arts films in the 1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema. [...] Born in San Francisco and raised in Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father, Lee Hoi-chuen. Lee's early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Ip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and frequent street fighting (neighborhood and rooftop fights). He moved to Seattle in 1959, enrolling at the University of Washington in 1961. It was during this time that Lee began to consider making money by teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting. He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of his home in Seattle. After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, Lee once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of [...] | Bruce Lee | |\n --- |\n| Black-and-white photograph of Lee standing shirtless outdoors.jpg) Lee filming The Big Boss (1971) | |\n| Born | Lee Jun-fan  (1940-11-27)November 27, 1940  San Francisco, California, U.S. |\n| Died | July 20, 1973(1973-07-20) (aged 32)  Kowloon, British Hong Kong |\n| Resting place | Lake View Cemetery, Seattle, Washington, U.S. |\n| Other names |  Lee Siu-lung  Lee Yuen-cham  Lee Yuen-kam |\n| Citizenship |  British subject (Hong Kong)  United States |\n| Occupations |  Martial artist  actor  philosopher  film director  screenwriter  producer |\n| Years active | 1941–1973 |\n| Works | Filmography |\n| Height | 172 cm (5 ft 8 in) |\n| Spouse | Linda Emery  ​ (m. 1964)​ |\n| Children |  Brandon  Shannon |\n| Parents |  Lee Hoi-chuen  Grace Ho |"

      "snippet": "Bruce Lee (born November 27, 1940, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died July 20, 1973, Hong Kong) was an American-born film actor who was renowned for his martial arts prowess and who helped popularize martial arts movies in the 1970s.\n\nLee was born in San Francisco, but he grew up in Hong Kong. He was introduced to the entertainment industry at an early age, as his father was an opera singer and part-time actor. The younger Lee began appearing in films as a child and was frequently cast as a juvenile delinquent or street urchin. As a teenager, he took up with local gangs and began learning kung fu to better defend himself. At that time he also started dance lessons, which further refined his footwork and balance; in 1958 Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship. [...] Lee’s parents were increasingly disturbed by his street fighting and run-ins with the police, and they sent him to live in the United States shortly after he turned 18. He lived with family friends in Seattle, where he finished high school and studied philosophy and drama at the University of Washington. While in Seattle he opened his first martial arts school, and in 1964 he relocated to Oakland, California, to found a second school. It was about that time that he developed his own technique—jeet kune do, a blend of ancient kung fu, fencing, boxing, and philosophy—which he began teaching instead of traditional martial arts. He drew the attention of a television producer after giving a kung fu demonstration at a Los Angeles-area karate tournament, and he was cast as the sidekick Kato in [...] Adam Augustyn\n\nFact-checked by\n\nBritannica Editors\n\nEncyclopaedia Britannica's editors oversee subject areas in which they have extensive knowledge, whether from years of experience gained by working on that content or via study for an advanced degree....\n\n Britannica Editors\n\nLast updated\n\n •History\n\nTop Questions\n\n### When was Bruce Lee born?\n\nBruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, in San Francisco, California, United States.\n\n### What is Bruce Lee famous for?\n\nBruce Lee was renowned for his martial arts prowess and helped popularize martial arts movies in the 1970s.

He soon realized that the value of martial arts training was found in the confidence it instilled instead of the need to defend one’s honor through fighting.\n\nDuring that time, he also developed interests in dancing and acting. The graceful movements he’d mastered in martial arts lent themselves to him being a terrific dancer, and Bruce’s early love of acting led to appearances in 20 films before leaving Hong Kong. [...] In 1959, at the age of 18 with $100 in his pocket, Bruce headed back to San Francisco. In the years that followed, he majored in philosophy at University of Washington, supported himself as a dance instructor and gung fu teacher, met and married his wife Linda, and opened multiple martial arts schools on the west coast.\n\nFate stepped in when Bruce’s otherworldly gung fu skills collided with an opportunity to return to acting in the 1966 TV series “The Green Hornet”. The birth of his two children, film roles catapulting him to success, writing, directing and developing his own martial art of “Jeet Kune Do” continued to fill his years until 1973, when he died in Hong Kong from an allergic reaction to a pain medication. Lee was 32. [...] The actions of the Bruce Lee Foundation continue to ensure Bruce Lee remains one of the most relevant sources of inspiration, motivation, and honest self-expression to millions around the globe.\n\n### Timeline\n\n#### 1940\n\nBorn in San Francisco, California on November 27.\n\n#### 1941\n\nAppears in the first of over 20 films as a child actor in Hong Kong.\n\n#### 1954\n\nBegins studying Wing Chun Gung Fu under Yip Man in Hong Kong.\n\n#### 1958\n\nBecomes the Crown Colony Cha-Cha Champion in Hong Kong.\n\n#### 1959\n\nDeparts Hong Kong for the United States, arriving in San Francisco, California before settling in Seattle, Washington.\n\n#### 1963\n\nOpens first Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute in Seattle, Washington.\n\n#### 1964"

Born in the United States before becoming a child actor in Hong Kong, Lee later returned to America and taught martial arts. In 1966, he began starring in the TV series The Green Hornet and later became a major box-office draw. Shortly before the release of Enter the Dragon in 1973, Lee died at age 32 from a cerebral edema.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Lee Jun Fan  \nBORN: November 27, 1940  \nDIED: July 20, 1973  \nBIRTHPLACE: San Francisco, California  \nSPOUSE: Linda Lee Cadwell (1964-1973)  \nCHILDREN: Brandon Lee and Shannon Lee  \nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius  \nHEIGHT: 5 ft. 7 in.\n\n## Early Life\n\nGetty Images [...] ## Early Life\n\nGetty Images\n\nBruce Lee, center, with his father and mother\n\nBruce Lee was born Lee Jun Fan on November 27, 1940, in San Francisco in both the hour and year of the Dragon. His father, a Hong Kong opera singer named Lee Hoi Chuen, moved with his mother, Grace Ho, and three children to the United States in 1939. Lee Jun Fan was born while his father was on tour in San Francisco.\n\nLee received the name “Bruce” from a nurse at his birthing hospital, but his family never used it during his preschool years. The future star appeared in his first movie at the age of 3 months. He served as the stand-in for an American baby in Golden Gate Girl (1941). [...] In any case, Lee has left a lasting legacy. His Hollywood breakthrough helped pave the way for broader depictions of Asian Americans in cinema and created a whole new breed of action hero—a mold filled with varying degrees of success by actors like Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, and Jackie Chan. He continues to be a revered martial artist, too. His daughter, Shannon, was largely involved in the 2011 update of her father’s instructional guide, Tao of Jeet Kune Do.\n\nLee’s life has been depicted in the 1993 movie Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, based on his wife Linda’s 1975 memoir, and the 2009 documentary How Bruce Lee Changed the World. In the summer of 2013, the Hong Kong Heritage Museum opened the “Bruce Lee: Kung Fu. Art. Life.” exhibition.\n\n## Grave"
