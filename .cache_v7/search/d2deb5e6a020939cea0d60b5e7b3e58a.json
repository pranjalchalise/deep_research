The disease can develop when your bone mineral density and bone mass decrease. It can also happen if the structure and strength of your bones change. [...] Osteoporosis is called a \"silent\" disease because it doesn't usually cause symptoms. You may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. This could happen with any bone, but it's most common in the bones of your hip, vertebrae in the spine, and wrist.\n\n### What causes osteoporosis?\n\nYour bones are made of living tissue. To keep them strong, your body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. Osteoporosis develops when more bone is broken down than replaced. You lose bone mass and changes happen in the structure of your bone tissue. This can happen as you get older. Other risk factors can also lead to the development of osteoporosis or increase your chance of developing the disease.\n\n### Who is more likely to develop osteoporosis? [...] Long-term use of certain medicines, such as:\n  + Corticosteroids\n  + Proton pump inhibitors (which treat GERD)\n  + Medicines to treat epilepsy\n Having other medical conditions, such as:\n  + Endocrine diseases\n  + Certain digestive diseases\n  + Rheumatoid arthritis\n  + Certain types of cancer\n  + HIV\n  + Anorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder\n Your lifestyle. Certain lifestyle factors can contribute to bone loss, such as:\n  + Smoking tobacco\n  + Long-term heavy alcohol use\n  + Physical inactivity or prolonged periods of bedrest"

      "snippet": "# Osteoporosis\n\nOsteoporosis is a condition where bones have become less dense (thinner). This makes them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years. It’s often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone to fracture or break.\n\nThe most common fractures in people with osteoporosis are:\n\n wrist fractures\n hip fractures\n fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae)\n\nFractures can also occur in other bones, like in the arm or pelvis. Rarely, a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture, or partial collapse or fracture of one of the bones of the spine.\n\nOsteoporosis isn’t usually painful until a fracture occurs. But, spinal fractures can be a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain. [...] Over 500,000 people need hospital treatment every year for fragility fractures. These are caused by osteoporosis. Fragility fractures are fractures that occur from standing height or less.\n\n## Causes of osteoporosis\n\nLosing bone density is a normal part of the ageing process. Some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.\n\nWomen lose bone quickly in the first few years after the menopause. Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45).\n\nIn most cases, the cause of osteoporosis in men is unknown. The risk of osteoporosis is higher in men with low levels of the male hormone testosterone."

I would say the first step in\npreventing osteoporosis is actually being screened for osteoporosis. So, knowing what is your bone density, So that is a test called a DEXA scan which is done typically in the doctor's [...] osteoporosis and had no prior knowledge of that. So, unlike say osteoarthritis which can cause pain; osteoporosis is an asymptomatic condition until you have a fracture. So, I would say getting screened is important and then depending on your test results discussing treatment options, which may be as simple as exercise and vitamin D, taking some calcium; or as complex as an either an oral or injectable medication."

This can lead to a decrease in bone strength that can increase the risk of fractures (broken bones). [...] Osteoporosis is a “silent” disease because you typically do not have symptoms, and you may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. Osteoporosis is the major cause of fractures in postmenopausal women and in older men. Fractures can occur in any bone but happen most often in bones of the hip, vertebrae in the spine, and wrist.\n\nHowever, you can take steps to help prevent the disease and fractures by:\n\n Staying physically active by participating in weight-bearing exercises such as walking.\n Drinking alcohol in moderation.\n Quitting smoking, or not starting if you don’t smoke.\n Taking your medications, if prescribed, which can help prevent fractures in people who have osteoporosis.\n Eating a nutritious diet rich in calcium and vitamin D to help maintain good bone health. [...] ## Osteoporosis Related Information\n\nJuvenile Osteoporosis\n\nOsteoporosis is a bone disease that develops when the bones get weaker and less dense. When a child or teen develops osteoporosis, the condition is known as juvenile osteoporosis.\n\nOsteoporosis in Men\n\nOsteoporosis is a bone disease that develops when bone mineral density and bone mass decreases, or when the quality or structure of bone changes. This can lead to a decrease in bone strength that can increase the risk of broken bones (fractures).\n\nPregnancy, Breastfeeding, and Bone Health\n\nHow do pregnancy and breastfeeding affect a woman’s bones? Calcium is in high demand during both pregnancy and breastfeeding – since it is needed to support the baby’s growth and development in the mother’s womb and after birth."

      "snippet": "In this installment, Nancy Salloum Harrison, MD, a rheumatologist at Hattiesburg Clinic’s The Arthritis Center–West, discusses what patients need to know about osteoporosis. Hattiesburg Clinic is a member of the AMA Health System Program, which provides enterprise solutions to equip leadership, physicians and care teams with resources to help drive the future of medicine.\n\n## It’s weaker bones\n\n“Osteoporosis is low bone mass, which means decreased bone strength and increased risk of fracture,” Dr. Harrison said, emphasizing that “it’s brittle bones.”\n\n“Patients with osteoporosis have low bone mass due to disruption of the normal structure of the bone,” she explained, noting that “the spine, the hip and the wrist are the most common areas for a fracture to occur.” [...] “The DEXA scan measures your bone-mineral density or a T-score. she said, explaining that “a T-score more than 2.5 deviations below normal is considered osteoporosis. A T-score of less than -2.5 is osteoporosis.”\n\n“A T-score of -1.0 or greater is considered normal. But a T-score of -1.0 to -2.5 is considered osteopenia and many fractures occur in this category. If you have osteopenia on DEXA scan you may still need treatment if you have a high risk of fracture.\n\n“That fracture-risk assessment tool is referred to as the FRAX score. This tool uses your personal risk factors in addition to your DEXA scan score to assess your risk of fracture in a 10-year period. This score can be mild, moderate or high,” says Dr Harrison."
