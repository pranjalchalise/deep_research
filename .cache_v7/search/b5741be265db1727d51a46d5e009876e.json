      "snippet": "Ha Dong General Hospital, a level I hospital in Hanoi, with a capacity of 550 beds, including 33 departments and specialties, is responsible for the health care of people in the western part of Hanoi city. Following social development trends, the hospital always invests in quality improvement and advancement, including the “Safe injection” program launched by the Vietnam Nurses Association. To provide a description of the situation regarding injection safety in Ha Dong General Hospital, we have conducted a study with the following objectives: (1) Describing the status of injection safety in the hospital; (2) Describing the status of knowledge and injection safety practice of nurses working in the hospital; and (3) Identifying the factors related to nurses’ knowledge and safe injection [...] This research showed that on average each patient received 3.1 injections. Compared to the results study in other countries, this rate is lower than result study of HAURI Global 2000 study16. However, this result is higher than Tu’s study17,18 and research by the Vietnam Nurses Association in 201014,19,20. About 37.6% nurses had been injured by sharp objects. The sharp injury rate at Ha Dong Hospital is higher than the results of Muc’s study14, Nguyen Tu’s 2005 study17, and lower than that of the Vong et al’s study in Cambodia21. Most of the injuries occurred in the morning. Unintended activities is the cause of most injuries. Meanwhile, sharp instruments injuries accounted for most of the fingers wounds. [...] ### Figure 1. Number of injections by parenteral administration.\n\nInjection rate in gluteal muscles accounted for 0.2% (Figure 2). In the in-depth interviews, where injection-performing nurses were interviewed about why gluteal muscles injections only accounted for 0.2% of the 3.6% of deep intramuscular injections, it was said that “using deep intramuscular gluteal muscles causes less pain for the patient, but both patient and staff are reluctant to use this method due to cultural reasons” (In-depth interview). As for the time of injection, among the 436 observations, the majority of injections were performed in the morning (62.6%) and 7.3% of injections performed in the evening; other injections were performed in the afternoon. In average, each patient received 3.1 injections."
