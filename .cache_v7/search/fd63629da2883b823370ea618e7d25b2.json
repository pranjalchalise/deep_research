      "snippet": "When Lee Kuan Yew speaks, presidents, prime ministers, diplomats, and CEOs listen. Lee, the founding father of modern Singapore and its prime minister from 1959 to 1990, has honed his wisdom during more than fifty years on the world stage. Almost single-handedly responsible for transforming Singapore into a Western-style economic success, he offers a unique perspective on the geopolitics of East and West. American presidents from Richard Nixon to Barack Obama have welcomed him to the White House; British prime ministers from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair have recognized his wisdom; and business leaders from Rupert Murdoch to Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil, have praised his accomplishments. This book gathers key insights from interviews, speeches, and Lee’s voluminous published [...] “Lee’s powerful intellect is captured in a new book, Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World.

Now 89, officially retired and somewhat frail, Lee has mellowed with age—not unlike his creation Singapore, governed today with a lighter touch even as its citizens grow more vocal.

Up close and personal, he can blow you away with one overpowering dismissive glare. Has there ever been anyone like him? . . . [The book] will reinforce the consensus view that Asia bred something special in Lee.”   \n —Tom Plate, South China Morning Post"
