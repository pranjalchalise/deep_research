      "snippet": "Understanding the core functions and typical use-cases helps stakeholders make informed decisions. This overview provides a foundation for exploring specific applications and trends in 2025.\n\n### Top 5 Uses You’ll See in the Real World\n\n### 1. Post-Injury Orthopedic Support\n\nOrthopedic braces are among the most common supports used in healthcare. They help immobilize joints after fractures or surgeries, reducing pain and promoting healing. For example, knee braces are widely adopted for ACL injuries, with studies showing a 30% faster recovery when used correctly. Hospitals and clinics are increasingly adopting lightweight, breathable materials to improve patient compliance and comfort. [...] ### 4. Sports and Athletic Support Devices\n\nSupports such as ankle braces or wrist guards are common in sports. They help prevent injuries or provide stability after an injury. Data from sports medicine indicates a 20% reduction in sprain recurrence with the use of high-quality supports. Athletes and trainers look for supports that are lightweight, durable, and conform to sport-specific needs.\n\nExample: Professional basketball players frequently use ankle braces during games to avoid sprains, especially in high-impact plays.\n\n### 5. Ergonomic Supports in Workplaces [...] Industry example: In 2023, a major commercial project in New York used prefabricated supports to accelerate timeline and ensure safety compliance.\n\n### 3. Support for Piping and Machinery\n\nIndustrial settings rely on supports to prevent mechanical failure. Pipe supports reduce vibration and stress, extending equipment lifespan. For example, in chemical plants, supports help manage thermal expansion and seismic activity. Adoption metrics show a 15% decrease in maintenance costs when supports are properly integrated. Companies prioritize supports that are corrosion-resistant and meet environmental standards.\n\n### 4. Sports and Athletic Support Devices"

Optionally, a third argument may be passed to define a \"step\" or increment to use: `a{1..100..10}b`. These are also sometimes referred to as \"ranges\".\n\nHere are some example brace patterns to illustrate how they work:\n\nSets\n\n```\n{a,b,c} => a b c {a,b,c}{1,2} => a1 a2 b1 b2 c1 c2 \n```\n\nSequences\n\n```\n{1..9} => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 {4..-4} => 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 {1..20..3} => 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 {a..j} => a b c d e f g h i j {j..a} => j i h g f e d c b a {a..z..3} => a d g j m p s v y \n```\n\nCombination [...] ## Usage\n\nThe main export is a function that takes one or more brace `patterns` and `options`.\n\n```\nconst braces = require('braces');// braces(patterns[, options]); console. log(braces(['{01..05}','{a..e}']));//=> ['(0[1-5])', '([a-e])'] console. log(braces(['{01..05}','{a..e}'],{expand true}));//=> ['01', '02', '03', '04', '05', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n```\n\n### Brace Expansion vs. Compilation\n\nBy default, brace patterns are compiled into strings that are optimized for creating regular expressions and matching.\n\nCompiled\n\n```\nconsole. log(braces('a/{x,y,z}/b'));//=> ['a/(x|y|z)/b'] console. log(braces(['a/{01..20}/b','a/{1..5}/b']));//=> [ 'a/(0[1-9]|1[0-9]|20)/b', 'a/([1-5])/b' ]\n```\n\nExpanded"

      "snippet": "Yes. Oh, yes...\n\nSo, if you have a \"hostile\" programming environment where you can't always trust the data that's being fed to your code, it's reasonable to embed all kinds of sanity checks...go full belt-and-suspenders, all the way.\n\nOtherwise, it's not needed.\n\nAvery Payne's user avatar\n\n## Comments\n\nAdd a comment\n\nI think that belt and braces is not a good practice.\n\nIf extreme reliability is required, as the case is for example with spaceship software, then the way to guarantee it is by providing multiple different implementations that run in parallel, are all provided the same input, and are all expected to provide the same output. Clearly, that's not belt and braces, it is something else. [...] I was wondering whether using a Belt and Braces (Suspenders) approach to programming - and to data validation in particular - was good practice or not. This came about from the following example.\n\nI was creating a form and I added Listeners to all the fields which should mean that the `OK` button is only enabled if all the fields in the form have valid values. I was then writing the code which was run when the `OK` button is clicked.\n\n`OK`\n`OK`\n\nThe pessimistic side of me decided that Belt and Braces never hurt anyone and it couldn't hurt to validate the form again in case there's a bug in my form logic.\n\nBut then I didn't know what to put in if the validation fails. If I do something like this:\n\n`if (! form.isValid()) {\ndisplayErrorMessage();\n}` [...] David Webb's user avatar\n\n## 9 Answers 9\n\nI don't do much UI work, but recently I found myself doing something very similar.\nI left in both the belt (validate each control as it changes) and the braces (check is valid again on OK\\_Click).\n\nI left both in on the basis that if some future change missed validation on the control, it would be caught when the OK button is clicked.\n\nIn my head the check on OK is the real validation, and the per control validation is sugar that just enhances the users experience.\n\nThat said I haven't thought about it too much, and I don't often do UI work.\n\nBinary Worrier's user avatar\n\n## 2 Comments\n\nAdd a comment"

It allows you to reference that step in later parts of the workflow using Double Braces.\n\nFor example: `{{ step.csv-to-json-v1-3 }}`\n\n## Referencing triggers\n\nYou can use Double braces to reference the trigger’s input data directly. To reference a trigger with Double Braces, use the following syntax:\n\n`{{ trigger.input }}`\n\nFor example:\n\n`{{ trigger.order.id }}`\n\nHere:\n\n trigger is a reserved word that refers to the trigger in the workflow.\n order is an object that corresponds to a key in the input sent to the trigger.\n id is a field within the `order` object, pointing to a specific value within the structure. [...] To access metadata, use the following syntax, replacing terms in angle brackets with the desired value:\n\nHere:\n\n metadata is a reserved word.\n data refers to the metadata you want to access.\n\nFor example, use the following syntax to refer to the name of the pipeline in which this code is being executed:\n\nThese are all the metadata you can access with Double Braces:\n\n### Pipeline metadata\n\ndata\n\nDescription\n\npipeline.name\n\nPipeline name\n\npipeline.versionMajor\n\nMajor version of the pipeline\n\npipeline.versionMinor\n\nMinor version of the pipeline\n\npipeline.realm\n\nPipeline realm\n\npipeline.description\n\nPipeline description\n\npipeline.id\n\nPipeline ID\n\nmetadata.pipeline.project\n\nName of the project of the pipeline that is being deployed.
