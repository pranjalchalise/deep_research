The company recently unveiled a new robotaxi and confirmed that autonomous testing is already underway on public roads in the San Francisco Bay Area. While the vehicle first appeared earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026, the bigger story now is what is happening after the show.\n\nLucid, Nuro and Uber unveil a robotaxi during Nvidia Live at CES 2026 ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.

Aura is designed specifically for household cats and dogs, with AI trained to recognize their behaviors, movements and vocal cues. The idea behind Aura is simple. Pets need more than food bowls and cameras. They need attention, interaction and reassurance.\n\nGOING BIG: What happens when artificial intelligence (AI) moves from painting portraits to designing homes? That question is no longer theoretical.

      "snippet": "## Context Window\n\n■The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is partnering with Google Cloud to use AI—including Google Gemini and a GenAI-driven Strategy Agent—to enhance both operations and fan engagement, offering real-time tailored insights, predictions and explanations during live broadcasts while also optimizing logistics and back-office workflows. [Newsweek]\n\n■ Meta is temporarily pausing teen access to its AI characters across apps as it works on updated versions with stronger safety controls, a move reflecting heightened industry focus on protecting minors from potential harms in AI interactions. [Associated Press] [...] ■ Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns that AI is entering a volatile “adolescence,” arguing in a new essay that rapidly advancing systems are outpacing society’s ability to manage their risks and calling for stronger safeguards as autonomy increases.[Dario Amodei]\n\n■ A coalition of U.S. state and federal judges launched the Judicial AI Consortium to study and prepare for both risks and opportunities as AI tools are increasingly used in courtrooms. [Reuters]\n\n■ MIT researchers find that machine-learning models with the best average performance can nonetheless fail on large portions of new data, arguing that overly aggregated metrics hide critical reliability issues and suggesting more granular evaluation methods for trustworthy AI deployment. [MIT News] [...] ## Core Intelligence\n\nBuilding with Care\n\nDeepMind is one of the most influential AI research organizations in the world, and in a recent conversation with Marcus Weldon, Newsweek’s contributing editor for AI, the lab’s chief operating officer, Lila Ibrahim, described how difficult it is to pursue cutting-edge breakthroughs while maintaining deep responsibility.\n\nAt DeepMind, the quest isn’t simply to push capabilities forward. It is to do so responsibly, embedding care and ethical reflection into research practices rather than treating them as afterthoughts. As Ibrahim put it, the guiding question for her team is, “How do we make sure that the AI is happening with us and not to us?”—highlighting a commitment to agency, oversight and alignment that goes beyond performance benchmarks."

      "title": "China narrows AI gap as Western tech leaders sound alarm at Davos 2026 - ynetnews.com",
      "snippet": "Demis Hassabis, founder and CEO of Google DeepMind, said Chinese AI companies are now only about six months behind the most advanced Western labs, a dramatic change from estimates just two years earlier that placed China several years back. Despite hardware limitations, Hassabis said, Chinese models have advanced rapidly and remain close to the cutting edge. The impact of DeepSeek’s 2025 release, which demonstrated competitive performance at far lower cost, still looms large in industry discussions. [...] That shift reflects growing recognition that U.S. efforts to slow China’s AI progress through export controls have not produced the expected results. In 2023, many Western analysts predicted that cutting off access to advanced processors would gradually choke China’s generative AI sector. The assumption was that AI progress depended primarily on raw computing power. Three years later, that view has been fundamentally challenged. [...] Elon Musk delivered a sharply different message. Once considered a controversial figure at the forum, Musk made a last-minute appearance in Switzerland and emphasized execution over caution. While others debated regulation and risk, Musk highlighted what he called an undeniable engineering milestone: the activation of Colossus 2, a computing cluster operating at the scale of a gigawatt. Musk dismissed calls to slow AI development in the name of safety and mocked rivals who advocate restraint, arguing that only speed and raw computing power can counter China’s advance."

      "snippet": "Google is actively exploring whether models can \"continue to learn out in the wild after you finish training them,\" DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told Axios during an on-stage interview at Axios House Davos.\n   OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a livestream last year that OpenAI is building a \"true automated AI researcher\" by March 2028.\n\nWhat they're saying:A new report from Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology shared exclusively with Axios shows how AI systems can both accelerate progress while making risks harder to detect and control. [...] What we're watching: You.com CEO Richard Socher is launching a new startup that will focus on this area, he shared during interviews at both the World Economic Forum in Davos last week and at DLD in Munich the week prior.\n\n   \"AI is code, and AI can code,\" Socher said. \"And if you can close that loop in a correct way, you could actually automate the scientific method to basically help humanity.\"\n   Bloomberg reports that Socher is raising hundreds of millions of dollars in a round that could value the new startup at around $4 billion.\n   \"I can't share too much, but I've started a company to do it with the people who have done the most exciting research in that area in the last decade,\" Socher told Axios the week prior at the DLD conference in Munich. [...] Between the lines: The idea of models that can learn on their own is a return of sorts for Hassabis, whose AlphaZero models used this approach to learn games like chess and Go in 2017.\n\nYes, but: Navigating a chessboard is a lot easier than navigating the real world.\n\n   In chess, it's relatively easy to logically double check whether a planned set of moves is legal and to avoid unintended side effects.\n   \"The real world is way messier, way more complicated than the game,\" Hassabis said.\n   Already, even before the adoption of this technique, researchers have seen signs of models using deception and other techniques to reach their stated goals."
