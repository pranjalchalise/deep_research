      "snippet": "Gaius Marius: Overlooked as a battlefield commander?\nGaius Marius (157-86 BC) is often overlooked for his skills as a commander and remembered more for his contributions as a military reformer of the Roman Republic. This is extremely unfortunate as his battlefield experiences are what helped to formulate and shape his military reforms that in turn helped to drive his extensive military successes. [...] Marius’ first truly great military success after concluding the Jugurthine War in 106 BC was his massive success over the combined Teuton and Ambrone tribes at the battle of Aqua Sextia in Aix-en-Provence in 102 BC. Here Marius inflicted over 60,000 casualties on the tribes, took over 20,000 prisoners and captured the Teuton King Teutobod. He soon followed this up by engaging and then annihilating a massive Cimbri army at the battle of Vercellae, where 160,000 were killed and over 60,000 captured and thus ending the Cimbrian War (113-101 BC) and returning honor back to the Roman military (who had suffered their biggest losses since Cannae at the hands of the Cimbri and their allies). [...] These successes were made possible by the fact that Marius, who was not born of an aristocratic family and who was endlessly ambitious and driven to succeed, was above else, a soldier through and through.  From his early days in the army of Scipio Africanus to the midpoint of the Cimbrian War, Marius had a gift for assessing where the Republic’s army was falling short and adapting it accordingly. The old Maniple Legion was too small, not mobile enough and not self-contained to be able to traverse, engage and then defeat the larger tribal armies that the Republic faced at the time. These innovations, as well as his requirement of intense training of the legionnaires both as fighting units and as individuals (he required regular physical fitness drills and a focus on martial skills),"

A lot of the things that you see in the Roman army, he's the guy that changes the armor. He's the guy that, you know, builds what's the size of a legion. He's the guy that decides Rome's gonna all March behind an eagle. So he does a lot of these military reforms. And he holds this office called Console. Console. There were two of them every year because Rome didn't want one person to hold all the power. So it was like having 2 presidents. You were supposed to hold the consulship once and not hold it again for 10 years. Marius holds that office 7 times and they used the idea of we have an emergency. We can't follow the laws.

As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the"

Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times. Rising from a family of smallholders in a village called Ceraetae in the district of Arpinum, Marius acquired his initial military experience serving with Scipio Aemilianus at the Siege of Numantia in 134 BC. He won election as tribune of the plebs in 119 BC and passed a law limiting aristocratic interference in elections. Barely elected praetor in 115 BC, he next became the governor of Further Spain where he campaigned against bandits. [...] Carney, Thomas F (1970). A biography of C. Marius (2nd ed.).

Contrary to popular belief, the Marius clan was influential locally, and maintained some limited client relationships with those in Rome.\n\nOf equestrian but outside roots, Marius would find his early attempts to climb the Roman social and political ladder difficult at best. Using the legion as his route to fame, fortune and power, he would become among the most influential men of his day, and the history of Rome. [...] Marius was both a great general and a sometimes adequate, if not good, politician. He was credited with saving Rome by defeating the Germanics, and created an atmosphere of enfranchisement with the Italians that was a necessity for Roman growth.\n\nThe reform of the legions was of the greatest benefit to the army and Roman power, but perhaps above all else, he was a deep influence on the life of his nephew, Gaius Julius Caesar. [...] Ancient sources suggest that Marius was pre-destined, through the visions of a seer, to be Consul of Rome seven times. Not only would this prove true, but he would eventually be hailed as the third founder of Rome, and its savior.\n\nMilitary glory and personal ambition drove Marius straight to the top of the Roman system, but perhaps even more importantly, the man and his legacy would have a profound impact on the life of his nephew, Gaius Julius Caesar.\n\nAs a youth, Marius may have used his modest family influence to join the Republican legions as a junior officer, or may have risen from the ranks. It is difficult to determine exactly, but it is known that he spent his early career in Hispania under Scipio Aemilianus, grandson of Scipio Africanus."
