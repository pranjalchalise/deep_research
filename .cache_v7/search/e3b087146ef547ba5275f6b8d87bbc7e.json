The collaborative study group comprised 3 chief members (A.O., S.N., and H.K.) and 6 assistant members (T.M., O.S., J.F., C.T., S.K., and T.I.). During February–June 2010, members of the collaborative study group contacted the attending physician of each child who died and visited the hospital to obtain detailed information. We abstracted data from medical records by using a structured report form and obtained demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data from interviews with attending physicians and chart reviews.
