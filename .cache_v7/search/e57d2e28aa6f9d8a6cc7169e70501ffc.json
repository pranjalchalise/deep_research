      "snippet": "## Background, origin and meaning of Claudiu:\n\nThe name Claudiu is a Romanian given name derived from the Roman family name \"Claudius,\" which is of uncertain Etruscan origin. One theory suggests it is connected to the Latin word \"claudus,\" meaning \"lame\" or \"crippled,\" possibly referring to a physical characteristic of an early member of the clan. However, this etymology is debated, and the true origin remains somewhat obscure. The name has been associated with qualities such as nobility, ambition, and strength, stemming from the prominence of the Claudian family in Roman history. Derivable or associated names include Claudia (feminine form), Claudio (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese), and Claude (French). [...] Several notable individuals bear the name Claudiu.

      "snippet": "Claudius (Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus), the younger brother of Germanicus, was a Claudian on the side of his father, Nero Claudius Drusus, younger brother of Tiberius. However, he was also related to the Julian branch of the Imperial family through his mother, Antonia Minor. As a son of Antonia, Claudius was a great-nephew of Augustus. Moreover, he was also Augustus' step-grandson due to the fact that his father was a stepson of Augustus. Unlike Tiberius and Germanicus, both of whom were born as Claudians and became adopted Julians, Claudius was not adopted into the Julian family. Upon becoming emperor, however, he added the Julian-affiliated cognomen Caesar \"Caesar (title)\") to his full name.[citation needed] [...] | Roman imperial dynasties |\n\n| The statue known as the Augustus of Prima Porta, 1st century |\n| Julio-Claudian dynasty |\n| Chronology |\n| Augustus  27 BCE – CE 14 |\n| Tiberius  CE 14–37 |\n| Caligula  CE 37–41 |\n| Claudius  CE 41–54 |\n| Nero  CE 54–68 |\n| |  |  |  --- | | Preceded by Roman Republic | Followed by Year of the Four Emperors | |\n|  v  t  e |\n\nThe Julio-Claudian dynasty comprised the first five Roman emperors: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.\n\nThis line of emperors ruled the Roman Empire, from its formation (under Augustus, in 27 BC) until the last of the line, Emperor Nero, committed suicide (in AD 68).\n\nThe name Julio-Claudian is a historiographical term, deriving from the two families composing the imperial dynasty: the Julii Caesares and Claudii Nerones. [...] ## Nomenclature\n\n[edit]\n\nJulius and Claudius were two Roman family names; in classical Latin, they came second. Roman family names were inherited from father to son, but a Roman aristocrat could—either during his life or in his will—adopt an heir if he lacked a natural son. In accordance with Roman naming conventions, the adopted son would replace his original family name with the name of his adopted family. A famous example of this custom is Julius Caesar's adoption of his great-nephew, Gaius Octavius."
