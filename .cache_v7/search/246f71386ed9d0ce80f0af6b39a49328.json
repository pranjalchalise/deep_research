      "snippet": "Dr. Ha Thanh Dong is a dynamic researcher in the field of aquatic animal health, internationally recognized for his contributions to infectious and emerging infectious diseases in tropical aquaculture, disease diagnostics, host-pathogen interactions, and vaccine development. He has played a key role in identifying and developing diagnostic methods for numerous infectious pathogens affecting aquaculture species, including tilapia, Asian sea bass, catfish, snake skin gourami, Siamese fighting fish, and whiteleg shrimp. Dong's research extends to fish immunology and vaccine development, and other new disease-control strategies, offering sustainable alternatives to antibiotics. Recent studies from his team have unveiled unprecedented applications of nanobubble technologies in enhancing the [...] Dong has authored or co-authored over 110 international peer-reviewed articles in this field and currently serves as an advisory board member and/or guest editor for several reputable journals in this field. In 2023, he was listed as one of the world's top 2% most-cited scientists in the field of Fisheries by Stanford University. Additionally, he has served as an expert and/or consultant for several projects led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the WorldFish Center. He is primarily affiliated with the Asian Institute of Technology and has recently been appointed to the honorary title and position of Adjunct Professor at James Cook University, Singapore.   \n  \n Back to home [...] applications of nanobubble technologies in enhancing the efficacy of immersion vaccines in aquaculture, setting the stage for further advancements in this industry."

This paper presents the validation of a simulation method for the vibro-acoustic response of a truck cabin, taking into account the effect of acoustic treatments, in the frequency range [0-200Hz]. The method combined a modal scheme for the structure and the cavity with a physical scheme for the acoustic treatment (porous materials). The model consists in a truck cabin with its cavity and five acoustic treatments (three floormats, the headliner and the rear trim panel). A measurement campaign is performed to get reference NTFs, VTFs and local inertances. The model without any treatments is first correlated. The noise reduction given by each treatment alone as well as grouped together is [...] is developed from the knowledge of the uncoupled subsystem modes. In this paper, one proposes to extend SmEdA by including the effect of a damping treatment. A damped subsystem consisting of a composite layer is modeled with the equivalent modulus of a single layer, which gives the same transverse displacement as a multi-layered system. The modal loss factor of a partially damped structure is estimated by the Modal Strain Energy method (MSE), and the results are well agreed with the Complex Eigenvalue Method (CEM). Finally, energy transmission between the damped structure and a coupled cavity can be deduced from SmEdA modeling, knowing the modeshapes and modal loss factors of the equivalent single layer and of the cavity. This method is applied for modeling a rectangular plate partially"

      "snippet": ">\n> Reference:\n>\n> Packing Order Control in Conductive Metal–Organic Frameworks by Tuning Ligand Oxidation State [...] New blue iridium complexes with a trimethylsilyl group as a bulky electron donating group, Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) and Ir(F2-m-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp), were synthesized via μ-chloro-bridged dimer and perfluoropropylated triazole-based ancillary ligands and then characterized using various spectroscopic studies. Both Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) and Ir(F2-m-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) exhibited high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of 75 ± 5% and 76 ± 5% in films, respectively. The DFT calculation demonstrated that the new blue iridium complexes have a wide bandgap compared with FIrpic and the Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) with a trimethylsilyl group in the para position has a slightly deeper HOMO level than that of the Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) with a trimethylsilyl group [...] Emissive molecules comprising a donor and an acceptor bridged by 9,9-dimethylxanthene, were studied (XPT, XCT, and XtBuCT). The structures position the donor and acceptor with cofacial alignment at distances of 3.3-3.5 ? wherein efficient spatial charge transfer can occur. The quantum yields were enhanced by excluding molecular oxygen and thermally activated delayed fluorescence with lifetimes on the order of microseconds was observed. Although the molecules displayed low quantum yields in solution, higher quantum yields were observed in the solid state. Crystal structures revealed ?-? intramolecular interactions between a donor and an acceptor, however, the dominant intermolecular interactions were C-H????, which likely restrict the molecular dynamics to create aggregation-induced"
