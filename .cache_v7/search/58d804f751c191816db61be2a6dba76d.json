      "snippet": "As a leader in open‑source agent development, LangChain’s bread and butter is building, orchestrating, and deploying agents seamlessly for developers and non‑technical users alike. To advance this mission, Brace Sproul, Head of Applied AI, and his team built a cloud‑hosted coding agent that runs autonomously end to end. To open-source it reliably, they needed to nail one thing: their sandbox partner. [...] Thanks to this reliable setup, LangChain allocates engineering hours and internal resources to the tasks that matter most: enhancing LangChain’s tools and libraries to facilitate agent testing, evals, and deployment. Because Brace and his team also configure details like CPU, RAM, and disk size limits, they optimize resource utilization without impacting performance or scalability.\n\nThese technical specs check every box on LangChain’s list. But what truly impressed Brace was Daytona's responsive assistance. As their cloud runtime platform hums in the background, their team stays hands-on through regular check-ins and swift online support. [...] And the team doesn’t stop at attentive support. They continuously evolve the platform based on LangChain’s feedback. By actively seeking input and implementing improvements quickly, Daytona keeps LangChain focused on their core projects and pushes them further ahead in the fast-moving AI space.\n\n#### The fact that Daytona is always so engaged and responsive is one of the main reasons why we chose them. Working with them has been seamless.\n\nBrace Sproul\n\nHead of Applied AI at LangChain\n\n###### 03 -- RESULT\n\n### LangChain Spins Up 4000 Sandboxes Every Month with Daytona"
