      "snippet": "## What is machine learning?\n\nMachine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.\n\nThe goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit “intelligent behaviors” like humans, according to Boris Katz, a principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL. This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language, or perform an action in the physical world. [...] Machine learning is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”\n\nThe definition holds true, according to a lecturer at MIT Sloan and head of machine learning at Kensho, which specializes in artificial intelligence for the finance and U.S. intelligence communities. He compared the traditional way of programming computers, or “software 1.0,” to baking, where a recipe calls for precise amounts of ingredients and tells the baker to mix for an exact amount of time. Traditional programming similarly requires creating detailed instructions for the computer to follow. [...] When companies today deploy artificial intelligence programs, they are most likely using machine learning — so much so that the terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes ambiguously. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.\n\n“In just the last five or 10 years, machine learning has become a critical way, arguably the most important way, most parts of AI are done,” said MIT Sloan professor the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. “So that's why some people use the terms AI and machine learning almost as synonymous … most of the current advances in AI have involved machine learning.”"

      "snippet": "Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks \"Task (computing)\") without explicit instructions. Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks \"Neural network (machine learning)\"), a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\n\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics. [...] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question, \"Can machines think?\", is replaced with the question, \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". [...] The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error."

      "snippet": "## What Is Machine Learning?\n\nMachine learning refers to the process by which computers are able to recognize patterns and improve their performance over time without needing to be programmed for every possible scenario. Instead of following a rigid set of rules, these systems analyze data, make predictions, and adjust their approach based on their learning.\n\nThis adapting ability makes machine learning one of the most powerful tools in modern technology. Thanks to it, computers can perform tasks that once required human intuition—like identifying objects in images, understanding spoken language, or detecting fraudulent transactions. [...] Though the concept might seem like a product of modern advancements, the idea has been around for decades. In 1959, Arthur Samuel, one of the pioneers in computer science, defined it as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” This means that instead of relying on fixed rules, machine learning systems develop their own insights by analyzing vast amounts of data and adjusting accordingly.\n\nThis idea was later reinforced by Herbert Simon, considered a founding father of artificial intelligence, who explained that machine learning is fundamentally about improving performance through experience—just as humans get better at tasks through practice.\n\n## Machine Learning Versus Other Similar Fields"

      "snippet": "Machine-learning can quickly analyze complex phenomena like this simulation of ice crystals. Machine learning combined shape classification, image processing, and statistical analysis to identify and characterize the ice grains.\n\nImage courtesy of Argonne National Laboratory\n\nMachine learning is the process of using computers to detect patterns in massive datasets and then make predictions based on what the computer learns from those patterns. This makes machine learning a specific and narrow type of artificial intelligence. Full artificial intelligence involves machines that can perform abilities we associate with the minds of human beings and intelligent animals, such as perceiving, learning, and problem solving. [...] All machine learning is based on algorithms. In general, algorithms are sets of specific instructions that a computer uses to solve problems. In machine learning, algorithms are rules for how to analyze data using statistics. Machine learning systems use these rules to identify relationships between data inputs and desired outputs–usually  predictions. To get started, scientists give machine learning systems a set of training data. The systems apply their algorithms to this data to train themselves how to analyze similar inputs they receive in the future. [...] If the training data is not labeled, the machine learning system is unsupervised. In the cancer scan example, an unsupervised machine learning system would be given a huge number of CT scans and information on tumor types, then left to teach itself what to look for to recognize cancer. This frees human beings from needing to label the data used in the training process. The disadvantage of unsupervised learning is that the results may not be as accurate because of the lack of explicit labels."

Through the use of algorithms that seek to imitate human intelligence, machine learning enables AI to improve outcomes through iteration. This ability to solve problems and generate predictions without explicit programming makes machine learning highly adaptable. [...] As early as 1959, Arthur Samuel, an early artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer, defined machine learning as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” Now, almost 70 years later, that definition has expanded to include a wide variety of different algorithms and models. Read on to learn what machine learning is, how it differs from other forms of artificial intelligence, and why it matters to your business.\n\n## What Is Machine Learning? [...] While machine learning enables computers to learn with a degree of independence, the computers still require human input. Data scientists feed training data into a machine learning algorithm to create a machine learning model. By adding live data to that model (once the training is complete), users are then able to generate new predictions. Finally, the outcomes of those predictions serve as further training data, increasing the model’s accuracy in what is referred to as the “flywheel effect” of accelerating progress.\n\n> Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on developing computers that learn similarly to humans.\n\n### Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence"

      "snippet": "# Machine learning defined\n\nMachine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables a system to autonomously learn and improve using neural networks and deep learning, without being explicitly programmed, by feeding it large amounts of data.\n\nMachine learning allows computer systems to continuously adjust and enhance themselves as they accrue more “experiences.” Thus, the performance of these systems can be improved by providing larger and more varied datasets to be processed.\n\n## Importance of machine learning [...] Whereas artificial intelligence is a broad category of computer science, machine learning is an application of AI that involves training machines to execute a task without being specifically programmed for it. Machine learning is more explicitly used as a means to extract knowledge from data through techniques such as neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning, decision trees, and linear regression. [...] ## How does machine learning work?\n\nMachine learning works by training algorithms on sets of data to achieve an expected outcome such as identifying a pattern or recognizing an object. Machine learning is the process of optimizing the model so that it can predict the correct response based on the training data samples."
