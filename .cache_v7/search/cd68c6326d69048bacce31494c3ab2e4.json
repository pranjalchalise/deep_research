      "snippet": "The marker was previously installed next to a school along upper King Street in 1948, but was removed by the city five years ago after a request from the school, which cited safety concerns after the marker was highlighted on social media as a potential target for vandalism.\n\nINSIDE robertlee-3.jpg\n\nMarion Square can be seen behind a roadside marker for the Robert E. Lee Memorial Highway on Jan. 30, 2026. The marker was installed in the square on Dec. 11.\n\nThe latest kerfuffle echoes other recent debates over public monuments that pay tribute to Confederate Civil War figures. Defenders of the reinstalled roadside marker point out the danger of erasing history and the importance of honoring military service and valor. [...] ## Love for Lee\n\nLee famously opposed creating war monuments, seeing them as costly and divisive.\n\nConcerning a Battle of Gettysburg memorial proposed in 1869, he said, “I think it wiser … not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.”\n\nLeaders of South Carolina ignored these words in 1938, when they officially designated a route between Charleston and Greenville as the Robert E. Lee Memorial Highway.\n\nINSIDE Silent Reading Party CHS Lit Festival_002.JPG (copy)\n\nDozens of participants gathered in Marion Square for the Charleston Literary Festival’s silent reading party on Sept. 23, 2025. [...] “Public debates over monuments — whether to remove, relocate, or restore them — often reveal deep divisions about history, identity, and community values. These controversies demonstrate how complex human love and memory can be,” wrote Manning. “Some see such memorials as heritage; others see them as symbols of oppression. And rather than uniting people, these symbols often become flashpoints for fear, contention, or enforced narratives.”\n\nINSIDE LEDE Birds of Prey_SEWE_2024_.JPG (copy) (copy) (copy)\n\nLance Doll released a Harris's hawk from the top of The Dewberry Hotel during SEWE’s Center for Birds of Prey flight demonstration at Marion Square in 2024.\n\n## What’s next, if anything"

      "snippet": "Jessee is a longtime student of General Lee. He has portrayed him in various venues throughout the US over the years. As a living historian, he is well known for his in-depth research to capture Lee’s character and demeanor. In 2015, he was approved by the National Park Service to portray General Lee at the 150th Anniversary of the Appomattox Surrender in Virginia, and appears in the new Appomattox Visitors Center film shown to the public daily. He recently appeared in the role of General Lee on April 9 and 10, 2022, at the park. He also has been a reenactor since 1969 at the age of 18, starting out as a Private, and through the years worked his way up the ranks to General. [...] General Lee, the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, remains one of the most compelling and controversial figures in American history. What is remembered most about him is a complex combination of his renowned military genius, his symbolic role in the “Lost Cause” of the Confederacy, and the ongoing, often heated, re-evaluation of his legacy focusing on his role as a slaveholder and his fight to preserve human suppression, better known as slavery.
