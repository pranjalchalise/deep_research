      "snippet": "Newsletter \n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nTesla founder Elon Musk is embroiled in many controversies. This has been turbocharged in the wake of his government position following President Donald Trump's reelection — and his recent, eventual falling-out with the president. Many in the U.S. increasingly view him as a lightning rod figure.\n\n## Trump and DOGE\n\nMusk generated significant controversy for his closeness to President Donald Trump. Musk contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump get elected in 2024, according to FEC filings, and previously referred to himself as the president's \"first buddy.\" [...] This includes weighing in on the debate over immigration in the United Kingdom and France, as well as calling for the U.K.'s King Charles III to dissolve Parliament. Musk also made controversial waves with his alleged support of AfD, a far right party in Germany accused of Nazi sympathies and labeled by Germany's intelligence domestic agency to be extremist. While AfD was boxed out of the government coalition following the country's election, it saw the best results for a far right party in Germany since World War II, as \"voter support flocks to AfD,\" said The Wall Street Journal. This is one area where the Trump administration and Musk continue agree post-rift, as Vice President J.D. Vance has praised AfD and criticized Germany for labeling it extremist. [...] ## Purchasing Twitter\n\nMusk controversially acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, handing him control of one of the world's largest social media brands. Immediately after his purchase, there were major concerns over a few changes he made to the platform, which he rebranded as X.\n\nAntisemitic and racist tweets spiked after Musk's acquisition; in the first 24 hours after his purchase, more than \"1200 tweets and retweets\" had spread antisemitism, the Anti-Defamation League said. Hateful rhetoric towards Black people also increased, with The Washington Post finding a 500% increase in the use of the N-word on X just half a day after Musk's purchase."

      "snippet": "In early 2025, The Conversation \"The Conversation (website)\") analysed Musk's path towards far-right politics within the context of \"the libertarian to alt-right pipeline\" and the shift of the Libertarian Party \"Libertarian Party (United States)\") to the right. The magazine stated that \"he remains a limited-government libertarian\", and that his online personality is \"part of a deliberate alt-right populist strategy to stoke controversy\", intended to disturb the left and claim persecution when criticized. Wired \"Wired (magazine)\") opined that Musk had become \"the hero of America's far-right movement\", and had become paramount within far-right community discussions. Jacobin \"Jacobin (magazine)\") defined his politics as libertarian authoritarianism, based on his political activities [...] In August 2024, Musk ignited a controversy after he shared an allegedly Islamophobic meme. He subsequently feuded with First Minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf, who described him as \"one of the most dangerous men on the planet\" and a \"race baiter\" who should be held to account. Musk responded that Yousaf is a racist \"scumbag\" who \"loathes white people\". [...] In January 2025, at a campaign event which was staged by the German far-right \"Far-right politics in Germany (1945–present)\") political party Alternative for Germany, Elon stated that \"There is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that\". That same week, Musk was criticized for a controversial gesture that was interpreted by some as a Nazi salute, which he made during Trump's inauguration, his comments about past guilt were condemned by the chairman of Israel's official memorial to Holocaust victims.\n\nIn January 2026, Musk reshared a tweet about \"white solidarity\" and on the same day, he claimed states like California are using immigrants to create a “one-party state.”\n\n### LGBTQ rights"

      "snippet": "His comments came shortly after Musk visited Israel, where he toured a kibbutz attacked by Hamas militants and held talks with top leaders.\n\nElon Musk speaking with Israeli President Isaac Herzog\n\nAdding fuel to the 'Pizzagate' fire\n\nYou don't need to go back far to find Musk's last controversial comment - only to Tuesday, in fact.\n\nOn 28 November, Musk was accused of promoting a long-debunked conspiracy theory which alleged high-profile Democrats ran a paedophile abuse ring from a Washington pizza restaurant.\n\nThe billionaire posted and later deleted a meme referencing \"Pizzagate\" on X.\n\nIt was an image from TV show The Office, with fake dialogue superimposed on to the scene to make it look like the characters were arguing about whether the conspiracy was real. [...] \"Does seem at least a little suspicious,\" Musk wrote.\n\nNBC News reports Musk has replied to X posts about Pizzagate at least four times since 20 November.\n\nOctober 2023 - Backing controversial war accounts\n\nX has long been criticised for failing to tackle the spread of disinformation about the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nBut Musk was accused of contributing to the issue directly just a few days after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israeli civilians when he posted the names of two controversial accounts, claiming they were \"good\" for \"following the war in real-time\". [...] He did eventually appoint Linda Yaccarino as his successor, labelling himself the company's new chief technology officer.\n\nDecember 2022 - Musk bans journalists from X\n\nMusk was told he faced EU sanctions after he claimed a number of prominent reporters had been booted off X for sharing personal information about him.\n\nHe claimed the journalists in question had \"doxxed my exact location in real-time\" because they had tweeted about @ElonJet, an account which tracked his private plane.\n\nMusk said people sharing his location were basically giving out \"assassination coordinates\"."

      "snippet": "The motion immediately garnered controversy, with some people, including history professors who study fascism and U.S. Representatives, expressing concern that the action was similar to a Nazi salute.\n\nSome, including the Anti-Defamation League, came to Musk’s defense, arguing that he was seemingly making an “awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm.”\n\nMusk addressed the controversy himself, saying: “The radical leftists are really upset that they had to take time out of their busy day praising Hamas to call me a Nazi.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## DOGE employees resigning [...] ## Overhauling multiple agencies through DOGE\n\nMusk has garnered much controversy during his time leading DOGE, specifically for his massive cuts at the federal level which, alongside actions from the Trump Administration, contributed to mass layoffs, the termination of government contracts, and efforts to close entire agencies. DOGE claims to have saved an estimated $175 billion for the federal government, a number which has been brought into question during various verification attempts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk’s goal to cut $2 trillion dollars has resulted in a multi-state lawsuit against Musk and DOGE, amid allegations that they violated the Constitution by accessing government data systems, canceling contracts of federal agencies, and terminating federal employees. [...] During his leadership at DOGE, Musk implemented a slew of far-reaching changes in his bid to eliminate waste within the government. His cuts at federal agencies and the termination of billions of dollars of government contracts—many of which have reportedly since been revived—prompted much criticism.\n\nAnd Musk has personally taken a hit, too. His Tesla showrooms have been the subject of arson attacks and people have boycotted both him and his businesses in protest.\n\nRead More:Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere’s a look back at Musk’s most controversial moments.\n\n## Musk is questioned about alleged drug use"

      "snippet": "# A timeline of Elon Musk's tumultuous Twitter acquisition\n\nMusk's acquisition of the social media company has been mired in controversy.\n\nByMax Zahn\n\nNovember 11, 2022, 2:21 PM\n\nThe richest person in the world said he wanted to own one of the most popular social media platforms -- until he said he didn't. In early October, he reversed course again, saying he wanted to complete the deal.\n\nOn Oct. 28, he finally did.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk completed the deal to acquire Twitter at his original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion.\n\nIn the ensuing days, Musk fired top executives, laid off half of the company's staff, formed a content moderation council that will review account reinstatements and revamped the platform's subscription service. [...] May 4 – Musk secures more than $7 billion in financing for the deal, including commitments from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and cryptocurrency exchange Binance, according to a securities filing.\n\nMay 6 – In a pitch deck for investors, Musk says he will quintuple Twitter's revenue by 2028, increasing annual earnings to $26.4 billion, the New York Times reports.\n\nMay 10 – Musk says he would reverse Twitter's ban of the account that belongs to former President Donald Trump. The remarks from Musk were made virtually at an auto conference.\n\nMay 12 – Twitter announces a temporary hiring freeze, pending Musk's acquisition; and two top executives leave the company. [...] Aug. 23 – News breaks that former Twitter Head of Security Peiter Zatko alleged in a federal whistleblower complaint that the social media giant had numerous wide-ranging information security system lapses, according to a copy of the complaint made public.\n\nIn response, Twitter blasted Zatko, who worked at the company from November 2020 to January 2022, saying he was spreading a \"false narrative about Twitter\" and was fired for \"ineffective leadership and poor performance.\"\n\nOct. 4 – Musk proposes the completion of a deal to acquire Twitter, reversing a monthslong effort to terminate the agreement. The proposal would complete the deal at Musk's original offer price of $54.20 a share at a total cost of roughly $44 billion, a person familiar with the proposal told ABC News."

      "snippet": "Musk resumed his criticism of Trump’s massive tax and domestic policy bill on Monday, as Republican leaders push to shore up support for the legislation and pushes to get it to the president’s desk by July 4. The Tesla CEO also repeatedly threatened to create a new political party if the agenda bill passes.\n\n“If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,” Musk said in an X post Monday evening.\n\nTrump fired back by threatening to use the Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk helped to create with the stated purpose of reducing “waste” and government spending, to target the subsidies the tech titan’s companies receive."
