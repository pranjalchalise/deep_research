Today we're releasing our first ambient agent of the week - an executive AI email assistant. This agent is built on top of a pattern we believe will be widely adopted throughout the agents released this year, and in years to come. Ambient agents are AI applications which can suggest actions to the user, then await your approval, feedback, or edits before executing the action. This pattern enables whole hosts of agent applications which would not have been fully trusted by users before, like an email assistant. Check out the free hosted executive AI email assistant here:  And the open source code here: \n\n122   6 Comments\n\nLike   Comment\n\nIoannis Bakagiannis   11mo \n\n Report this comment [...] Tomer Raitz\n\n  + Report this post\n\n  🤖 Tip: Turn Claude into your personal AI agent Most people open a new chat every time they use Claude. But there's a better way: Use Claude Projects 👇 Go to  → Projects → Create your own agent Here's what makes it powerful: ✅ Custom instructions - Tell Claude your role, preferences, and how to help you ✅ Persistent files - Upload documents that give Claude context about your work ✅ Memory - Each new chat in the project remembers your goals and context Example: I created a marketing expert agent with specific instructions. Each time I generate a new file or diagram, I add it to the project files. Result? The agent gets better over time because it learns from our past work together. 📈 What would you use a custom Claude agent for? Drop a comment 👇\n\n  6"

      "title": "How LangChain Found a Trusted Partner for Their Sandbox Needs",
      "snippet": "As a leader in open‑source agent development, LangChain’s bread and butter is building, orchestrating, and deploying agents seamlessly for developers and non‑technical users alike. To advance this mission, Brace Sproul, Head of Applied AI, and his team built a cloud‑hosted coding agent that runs autonomously end to end. To open-source it reliably, they needed to nail one thing: their sandbox partner. [...] For the agent to run safely across thousands of users and complex use cases, Brace needed secure, production-level sandboxes fast and at scale. But he and his team knew from experience that building internal infrastructure drained valuable resources and engineering time. That effort was better spent enriching libraries, enhancing evals, and debugging products. So they started looking for a partner who offered a solution out of the box.\n\nThe requirements weren’t trivial. Each sandbox needed bulletproof isolation to limit access to sensitive data and fine-grained permissions to ensure protection from external attacks. And instant spin‑up wasn't just a nice‑to‑have. Any delays could impact user engagement and break agent workflows. [...] #### If anybody asked me which runtime platform to use, I'm going to 100% say Daytona every time. With their SDK, we never have to worry about an agent leaking or taking actions that it shouldn't. I haven't seen this anywhere else.\n\nBrace Sproul\n\nHead of Applied AI at LangChain\n\n###### MORE CUSTOMER STORIES\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona##### How Orchids Powers the World's First AI Full-Stack Engineer With Daytona\n\n##### How Orchids Powers the World's First AI Full-Stack Engineer With Daytona"
