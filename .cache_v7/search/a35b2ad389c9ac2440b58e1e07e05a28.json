A user submits a question to Amazon Bedrock and the LangChain agent.\n2. The Amazon Bedrock foundation model uses the Neptune schema, which is provided by the LangChain agent, to generate a query for the user's question.\n3. The LangChain agent runs the query against the Amazon Neptune medical knowledge graph.\n4. The LangChain agent sends the retrieved context to the Amazon Bedrock foundation model.\n5. The Amazon Bedrock foundation model uses the retrieved context to generate an answer to the user's question.\n\n## Step 4: Creating a knowledge base of real-time, descriptive data [...] You might also use a dataset that provides annotated, de-identified patient discharge summaries that are specifically curated for research purposes. A discharge summary dataset can help you experiment with entity extraction, allowing you to identify key medical entities (such as conditions, procedures, and medications) from the text. Step 2: Building a medical knowledge graph in this guide describes how you can use the structured data extracted from the MIMIC-IV and discharge summary datasets to create a medical knowledge graph. This medical knowledge graph serves as the backbone for advanced querying and decision-support systems for healthcare professionals."
