He won\nhis second consulship in 104 B.C., and shortly afterward achieved great renown\nfor defeating the Teutone and Cimbri invaders in northern Italy.\nThese victories brought him great\npopularity with both the people of Rome, and the army, and he was elected consul five years in\nsuccession, from 104 to 100 B.C., an unprecedented run. During this period he\nreorganized the army, an achievement that laid the ground work for the Roman legions of imperial\ndays. Under Marius, Rome established for the first time a standing army, manned by professional\nsoldiers. During this period Marius achieved great things for Rome, enjoyed immense popularity, and\nwas called the \"Third Founder of Rome.\""

      "snippet": "After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate [...] In the next campaigning year, Marius is listed as one of the senior legates of the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus \"Publius Rutilius Lupus (consul)\"), who was perhaps one of his relatives. Lupus fell to a Marsic ambush on 11 June 90 BC while crossing the river Tolenus; Marius, commanding a different wing of the army, was yet able to drive the enemy back with heavy losses. The senate, after Lupus' death, appointed Marius in joint command with the praetor Quintus Servilius Caepio \"Quintus Servilius Caepio (quaestor 103 BC)\"); Caepio, however, quickly fell to a Marsic act of perfidy, leaving Marius in sole command. After taking command over the northern front of the war, Marius moved energetically forward, defeating the Marsi with his former legate Sulla's help on hilly ground south of the [...] After Sulla left Rome to prepare for his army in Nola to depart for the east, Sulpicius had his measures passed into law, and tacked on a rider which unprecedentedly appointed Marius – now a private citizen lacking any office in the Republic – to the command in Pontus. Marius then sent two of his legates to take the command from Sulla. These moves were foolish: Evans notes \"Marius's political ingenuity seems to have deserted him\" and calls his actions rash. Sulla refused to relinquish his post, even though all but one of his own subordinates opposed Sulla's course of action. After killing Marius's legates, Sulla rallied his troops to his personal banner and called upon them to defend him against the insults of the Marian faction. The ancient sources say that Sulla's soldiers pledged their"

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] External Websites\n\n Encyclopedia Romana - The Life of Marius\n Western Oregon University - The Role of Mariusï¿½s Military Reforms in the Decline of the Roman Republic\n The Classical Association of South Africa - Gaius and Marcus in Iberia and Gaul: Family Affairs and Provincial Clients\n World History Encyclopedia - Gaius Marius\n UNRV History - Biography of Gaius Marius\n The Roman Empire - Gaius Marius, the 1st one to shake the Roman Republic\n Colorado Pressbooks Network - Ancient Rome ï¿½ Sourcebook and Historical Atlas - Gaius Marius\n\n# Gaius Marius\n\nRoman general\n\nWritten by\n\nJohn P.V.

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius is one of the most compelling personalities of the Roman Republic. Entering politics as a “novus homo” from Italy with few political connections, he proved both his military skill and unbridled ambition during the Jugurthine War. He was subsequently elected consul an incredible seven times as he was seen as the only general capable of dealing with the Cimbrian threat.\n\nServing into his late 50s, Marius initially looked like he would retire as a respected statesman, but fate and ambition involved him in a civil war that left the general dead and Sulla as dictator in Rome. This is the story of Rome’s first strongman, who broke precedents and created a personal army, paving the way for future strongmen, like his nephew Julius Caesar.\n\n## Gaius Marius: Novus Homo [...] ## Gaius Marius: Novus Homo\n\ngaius marius portrait vatican\n\nGaius Marius was born in 157 BCE in the Arpinum area of Latinum in Italy. Rome conquered the region in the 4th century BCE, but its people were only granted Roman citizenship in 188 BCE. Marius was one of the first leading men of Arpinium to consider a political career in Rome.\n\nThe biographer Plutarch suggests Marius came from a family of small landholders and that his father was a laborer. This plays into Plutarch’s characterization of Marius as a commoner who built his formidable career with nothing but ambition. However, Marius must have come from local nobility with considerable wealth for his family to have sponsored his political career, and that of his younger brother Marcus Marius, in Rome. [...] The civil war continued without Marius, who was made the scapegoat for many crimes. The conflict culminated with Sulla returning to Rome and having himself declared dictator.\n\nphoto of Jessica Suess\n\nJessica holds a BA Hons in History and Archaeology from the University of Queensland and an MPhil in Ancient History from the University of Oxford, where she researched the worship of the Roman emperors.

Of the surviving accounts about Marius, each author had a specific theme in their writings that illuminate only a portion of his life. Each author was also positioned in a different era of Roman history and was affected differently by the ripple effect of events stemming from Marius' spectacular career. For example, Cicero, in speeches closest to Marius' lifetime, used Marius' actions as historical examples to provide defenses for Cicero's actions and provided indirect information about Marius. Sextus Julius Frontinus (c. 40-103 A.D.) used several descriptions of Marius' strategies and tactics to provide clear examples of success for later Roman military leaders.

He represents much what many Romans consider to be morally wrong (desire for power and military glory) and essentially was a dictator for six years. However, much of what was written about him was from later sources who were writing near or well after the Civil Wars. Despite attempts to turn him into a villain, the Roman public seemed to have adored him, and he was able to work with the Senate on some things.
