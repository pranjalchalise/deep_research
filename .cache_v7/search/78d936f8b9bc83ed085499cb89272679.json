At one point Frost mentions Franklin Pierce, the only U.S. President to come from New Hampshire, then says \"He's your one chance to score against the state.\" [...] During the 1852 election, Pierce's good friend Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a campaign biography titled The Life of Franklin Pierce.

He was technically the first president born in the 19th century; Millard Fillmore was born in 1800, which is part of the 18th century. He was a Representative and Senator from New Hampshire beforehand, and a brigadier general during the Mexican-American War.

He served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate. Pierce dominated the Democratic Party in New Hampshire during the 1830s and 1840s, when Democrats controlled the state’s political affairs. He also became an influential figure in the Democratic Party nationally. Throughout his career, Pierce believed ardently that the federal union between the states must be preserved at all costs. Although he was personally opposed to slavery, he argued that slavery was protected in the U.S. Constitution and therefore the federal government must support it. In the 1830s, many political leaders shared this view, but public [...] 1852\n\nWilliam Hazen Kimball\n\nCaption:\n\nNew Hampshire politician Franklin Pierce ran for president of the United States in the election of 1852.

He was born and raised in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, and later moved to Concord. He was a lawyer and a politician. Before he was elected president, he represented New Hampshire in the U.S. Congress. He also served in the U.S. Army in the Mexican-American War. He was president for one term, from 1853 to 1857. This was a very difficult time for the United States. There was a lot of tension between the North and the South over slavery. President Pierce thought it was more important to keep the country together than to abolish slavery. He tried to find a compromise between the two sides, but it did not work and made the problems worse."

      "snippet": "During the presidential election of 1852, his Whig opponents called Pierce \"Fainting Frank\" because of the perceived lack of bravery and \"Hero of Many a Well-Fought Bottle\" in reference to his alcoholism. The mud-slinging led Ulysses S. Grant to come to Pierce's defense in his memoirs (published long after Pierce's death in 1869), writing that, \"whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the Presidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage. I was not a supporter of him politically, but I knew him more intimately than I did any other of the volunteer generals.\"\n\n## 4. Franklin Pierce beat his old boss to win the presidency.

That doesn't mean he isn't fascinating. Born November 23, 1804 in a log cabin in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, the 14th President of the United States of America was a member of a storied family that traced its Colonial roots back to Thomas Pierce's immigration to the Massachusetts Bay Colony around 1634. His mother was Anna Kendrick (not that one), and his father was farmer, Revolutionary War hero, and eventual governor Benjamin Pierce. [...] ## 3. Franklin Pierce was called \"Hero of Many a Well-Fought Bottle\" and \"Fainting Frank.\"\n\nPierce's military service during the Mexican-American War came after he'd already served as a member of the House of Representatives and as a United States Senator, and he was right that military service would boost his profile on the national stage, despite the fact that he had resigned from the Senate in 1841. The problem was that people thought he was a coward."

      "snippet": "Pierce remained involved in the state Democratic Party, which was split by several issues. Governor Hill, who represented the commercial, urban wing of the party, advocated the use of government charters to support corporations, granting them privileges such as limited liability and eminent domain for building railroads. The radical \"locofoco\" wing of his party represented farmers and other rural voters, who sought an expansion of social programs and labor regulations and a restriction on corporate privilege. The state's political culture grew less tolerant of banks and corporations after the Panic of 1837, and Hill was voted out of office. Pierce was closer to the radicals philosophically, and reluctantly agreed to represent Hill's adversary in a legal dispute regarding ownership of a [...] Franklin Pierce was born on November 23, 1804, in a log cabin in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. He was a sixth-generation descendant of Thomas Pierce, who had moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from Norwich, Norfolk, England, in about 1634. His father Benjamin \"Benjamin Pierce (governor)\") was a lieutenant in the American Revolutionary War who moved from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, to Hillsborough after the war, purchasing 50 acres (20 ha) of land. Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife Anna Kendrick; his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth, leaving a daughter. Benjamin was a prominent Democratic-Republican state legislator, farmer, and tavern-keeper. During Pierce's childhood, his father was deeply involved in state politics, while two of [...] While Pierce was popular and outgoing, his family life was difficult; his three children died young, and his wife, Jane Pierce, suffered from illness and depression for much of her life. Their last surviving son was killed in a train accident while the family was traveling, shortly before Pierce's inauguration. A heavy drinker for much of his life, Pierce died in 1869 of cirrhosis. As a result of his support of the South, as well as failing to hold the Union together in time of strife, historians and scholars generally rank Pierce as one of the worst and least memorable U.S. presidents.\n\n## Early life and family\n\n[edit]\n\n### Childhood and education\n\n[edit]"

After a deadlock developed among supporters of the leading presidential contenders—Lewis Cass, Stephen A. Douglas, and James Buchanan—a coalition of New England and Southern delegates proposed “Young Hickory” (a reference to Andrew Jackson, who had been known as “Old Hickory”), and Pierce was nominated on the 49th ballot."
