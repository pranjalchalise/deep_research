      "snippet": "In 1903 Bishop College awarded Lee an honorary master of arts degree, and in 1905 he returned to Tuskegee as director of the academic department. Ten years later he left to become the principal of Lincoln High School in Kansas City, Missouri. There he developed an industrial department that served as a model for other Missouri schools. In 1918 Wilberforce University awarded Lee an LL.D. in recognition of his notable humanitarian services, and some years afterwards Howard University honored him with another LL.D for his \"outstanding contributions to Negro education.\" One of those contributions was the founding in 1904 of the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools, of which he was president for the first five years. [...] In 1921 Lee left education to become the extension secretary for the national Urban League. In 1924 he became president of Florida A&M College in Tallahassee, Florida, where he remained for the next twenty years. During his tenure Lee expanded the school curriculum, introduced extension programs, and obtained accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. His son, J. R. E. Lee, Jr., helped his father obtain funds for Florida A&M's continued growth. During his tenure at Florida A&M Lee also served as an ex officio consultant to the Educational Policies Commission, a member of the National Educational Association, a member of the Florida State Advisory Committee for the National Youth Administration, and chairman of the State Negro Defense Saving Committee. [...] John Robert Edward Lee, civic leader, teacher and educational-association founder, was born a slave on January 26, 1864, in Seguin, Texas, to John and Mary (Mayes) Lee. He attended Bishop College in Marshall, Texas, after receiving his elementary and secondary education in Seguin. His outstanding scholarship at Bishop led to his appointment as a student assistant to the faculty. After receiving his A.B. and graduating with honors in 1889, Lee became the principal in a two-teacher school in Palestine. In 1891 he left Palestine to assume the role of dean of men and professor of Latin, mathematics, and history at Bishop College. During that time he also served as a consultant for the black schools and churches of Marshall. Lee's work at Bishop brought him to the attention of Booker T."

      "snippet": "In 1865, Lee became president of Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia; as president of the college, he supported reconciliation between the North and South. Lee accepted the termination of slavery provided for by the Thirteenth Amendment, but opposed racial equality for African Americans. After his death in 1870, Lee became a cultural icon in the South and is largely hailed as one of the Civil War's greatest generals. As commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, he fought most of his battles against armies of significantly larger size, and managed to win many of them. Lee built up a collection of talented subordinates, most notably James Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson, and J. E. B. Stuart, who along with Lee were critical to the Confederacy's [...] Several historians have noted what they consider the contradictory nature of Lee's beliefs and actions concerning race and slavery. While Lee protested he had sympathetic feelings for blacks, they were subordinate to his own racial identity. While Lee held slavery to be an evil institution, he also saw some benefit to blacks held in slavery. While Lee helped assist individual slaves reach freedom in Liberia, and provided for their emancipation in his own will, he believed slaves should be eventually freed in a general way only at some unspecified future date as a part of God's purpose. Slavery for Lee was a moral and religious issue, and not one that would yield to political solutions. Emancipation would sooner come from Christian impulse among slave masters before \"storms and tempests of [...] Lee himself enslaved a small number of people in his lifetime and considered himself a paternalistic master. There are various historical and newspaper hearsay accounts of Lee's personally whipping a slave, but they are not direct eyewitness accounts. He was definitely involved in administering the day-to-day operations of a plantation and was involved in the recapture of runaway slaves. One historian noted that Lee separated families of enslaved people, something that prominent enslaving families in Virginia such as Washington and Custis did not do. On December 29, 1862, the last day he was allowed to legally retain them, Lee finally freed all the enslaved people his wife had inherited from George Custis (in accordance with the Custis will). Before this, Lee had petitioned the courts to"

      "snippet": "President Robert E. Lee played an important and critical role in the development of Washington College after the Civil War. He expanded enrollment, enhanced the endowment, transformed the curriculum, and established a code of honor and conduct for students. Without President Lee’s unique personal contributions, Washington College would never have become the prosperous and highly-regarded Washington and Lee University of modern times.\n\nIndeed, leaders of the North and South hailed President Lee’s contributions to higher education and national reconciliation on the occasion of the centennial of his birth in 1907. [...] In light of the praise General Lee received from contemporaries who were anything but die-hard Southern sympathizers, it is surprising that some present-day writers overlook Lee’s many positive contributions as president of Washington College.  For example, Ty Seidule largely ignored Lee’s efforts to promote national reconciliation and improved education after the Civil War ended.   But, Elizabeth Brown Pryor did acknowledge that while educational reform was not Lee’s specialty, he performed it conscientiously and “developed an innovative approach with far-reaching applications.”(#_ftn4)  He raised funds for the college from donors in the North and the South, constructed new buildings, expanded enrollment, and revitalized the curriculum.   By personal example he taught students honor, [...] In reflecting on Robert E. Lee’s contributions as an educator and leader in the post-Civil War period, it is worth emphasizing that the Southern economy was in ruins.  The rail system was shattered and agriculture in shambles. Farmers lacked work animals for plowing fields.  Many former soldiers had few marketable skills.  Some needed remedial education.  Under Lee’s direction Washington College provided learning opportunities.  For the benefit of young men who had been prevented by the war from obtaining adequate preparation for college, the college even offered elementary instruction in Latin, Greek, mathematics and English.(#_ftn14)"

      "snippet": "Professor Lee's academic career spanned over 60 years. He made significant breakthroughs in various fields, including quantum field theory, elementary particle theory, nuclear physics, statistical mechanics, fluid mechanics, and astrophysics. His relentless pursuit of truth and scientific knowledge led to lasting and impactful contributions to the development of physics. Professor Lee was a dedicated advocate for the advancement of science, technology and education in China. His unwavering commitment to his motherland was evident in his efforts to promote high-energy physics, notably through his work on the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider. He played a pivotal role in establishing the “School of the Gifted Young” (SGY) at the University of Science and Technology of China, initiated the [...] of Science and Technology of China, initiated the China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application (CUSPEA), and proposed the establishment of postdoctoral fellowships, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and other important institutions. He founded the China Center of Advanced Science and Technology (CCAST) and proposed the establishment of the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute to focus on fundamental scientific issues. His contributions significantly advanced China's scientific and technological education and talent cultivation.

      "snippet": "Throughout his distinguished career, Lee made significant advancements in theoretical physics, authoring more than 300 research papers and several influential books. Most notably, in 1957, during his time at IAS, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics alongside his Institute colleague Chen-Ning Yang (楊振寧), Member (1949–54) and Faculty (1955–66) in the School of Mathematics/Natural Sciences. The pair were awarded the Prize for their revolutionary work on parity violation in weak interactions, which fundamentally changed our understanding of the laws of physics. [...] Although best known for his contributions to the field of particle physics, Lee’s early work focused on stellar astrophysics. In 1950, he completed his doctoral studies with a thesis on the hydrogen composition of white dwarf stars. His research demonstrated that these stellar remnants contain minimal hydrogen, specifically less than 1% of their mass. This provided strong evidence that white dwarfs represent the final evolutionary stage for most stars. [...] As a Chinese-American scientist who achieved great success in the United States, Lee also served as an important bridge between the scientific communities of China and the West. Lee directed considerable efforts to nurturing Chinese scientists through the establishment of programs such as CUSPEA.3 In an interview with Adam Smith, Editor-in-Chief of NobelPrize.org, conducted in 2007, Lee described how, in the late 1970s and into the 1980s, “there was no way for a Chinese college graduate to go to [the] United States or Canada or any place to study” because the cost was prohibitive. His program, organized primarily to support students working in physics, was extended through his friends and colleagues to also assist biology students, as well as those in other fields. Lee’s efforts have been"

      "snippet": "Along with his collaborator Chen Ning Yang, T. D. Lee was the first Chinese Nobel Prize laureate. He received the prize when he was just 31 years old, which made him the youngest scientist to receive this prestigious award after World War II. In his more than 300 papers, Lee has made momentous contributions to various branches of theoretical physics, including particle physics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, astrophysics and hydrodynamics. The work that gained Lee and Yang the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics was the analysis of the status of parity conservation in weak interactions, carried out in 1956. This research led to the experimental discovery that neither parity (P) nor charge conjugation (C) is conserved in weak interactions. The words written [...] with him two relevant papers on statistical mechanics, which solved some problems affecting the theory of phase transitions. Lee and Yang showed that one could get different thermodynamic functions (pressure, density) for different phases (gas, liquid or solid). This argument led to the formulation of the “unit circle theorem” concerning the partition functions used for ferromagnetic systems in statistical field theory. In 1953, Lee was appointed Assistant Professor at the Columbia University of New York City. Although Yang remained at Princeton, their collaboration was not disrupted, and in the next few years Lee and Yang continued to make several contributions, including the endeavour that gained them the Nobel Prize. [...] In the early 1960s, many physicists began re-exploring the idea that weak interactions were mediated by heavy vector bosons. Lee wrote a number of papers on the properties of these hypothetical particles and had a certain influence on the following development of the unified quantum field theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions, especially through the work Lee made on the Feynman rules for vector bosons. In 1964, Lee wrote a paper with Michael Nauenberg analysing the properties of zero-rest mass particles, that later became a benchmark to understand the behaviour of gluons in quantum chromodynamics. In this paper, Lee and Nauenberg provided a method for dealing with divergences that came to be known as the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem (KLN theorem), because it was derived"
