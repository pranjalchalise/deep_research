      "snippet": "## Activism\n\nWhile working at the Income Tax Department in Delhi, Kejriwal was frustrated by the way his department functioned. In 1999, using donations from family members, he started the organization Parivartan (Hindi: “Change”), which worked to address citizens’ grievances related to public works, food rations, income tax, and electricity. Parivartan identified several misappropriations of funds in public works projects by using the Right to Information Act, which allows citizens to access government records. [...] Kejriwal worked at Tata Steel in Jamshedpur from 1989 to 1992 before resigning to prepare for the Civil Services Examination in order to enter into government service work. He met Mother Teresa in Calcutta (Kolkata) during this break and performed volunteer work with the Missionaries of Charity for two months. Kejriwal took the Civil Services Examination and began working at the IRS in 1995. He met his future wife, Sunita Agarwal, a fellow IRS officer, during training at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy of Administration in Mussoorie.\n\n## Activism [...] In 2006 he was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership—a recognition for social transformation and leadership in Asia—for his work with Parivartan. He resigned from the IRS the same year to become a full-time activist and donated his Magsaysay award money to found the Public Cause Research Foundation, a nongovernmental organization. In 2012 he published a book entitled Swaraj (“Self-governance”), in which he describes his views on corruption and Indian democracy."

      "snippet": "In 2006, Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his involvement in the Parivartan movement using right to information legislation in a campaign against government corruption. The same year, after resigning from government service, he founded the Public Cause Research Foundation to campaign for transparent governance. Before entering politics, Kejriwal had worked in the Indian Revenue Service. Prior to that, he was a mechanical engineer from IIT Kharagpur. [...] In 2001, the Delhi government enacted a state-level Right To Information (RTI) Act, which allowed the citizens to access government records for a small fee. Parivartan used RTI to help people get their work done in government departments without paying a bribe. In 2002, the group obtained official reports on 68 public works projects in the area, and performed a community-led audit to expose misappropriations worth ₹ 7 million in 64 of the projects. On 14 December 2002, Parivartan organised a Jan sunvai (public hearing), in which the citizens held public officials and leaders accountable for the lack of development in their locality.
