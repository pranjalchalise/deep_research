      "snippet": "Mr Kejriwal was born in the neighbouring village of Siwani, where his trader father had migrated to since it boasted a wholesale market. He studied in the eastern city of Calcutta and joined a top engineering school in West Bengal state's Kharagpur town.\n\nBut his family is better known in Kheda. The Kejriwal home is derelict and needs a makeover. But it stands out as the largest building in the village.\n\nVillagers say Mr Kejriwal's ancestors have built a school, tube well, temple, community hall and a public rest house in Kheda - much \"more than what the government has done here\".\n\n\"We are forever grateful and proud of how much they have done for us over the years,\" says village elder Ram Chand Sharma.\n\n## 'Dead honest' [...] ## 'Dead honest'\n\nMost of the 2,000-odd residents of Kheda have actually never met Mr Kejriwal: he has no friends here and the relatives have few memories of his growing up years. He occasionally visited the village during festivals and weddings.\n\nYet, they are full of praise for the 44-year-old man who has become the most talked about leader in the country.\n\nA former civil servant, Mr Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay award for Emergent Leadership, widely described as Asia's Nobel prize, for social work and initiatives to fight corruption in 2006.\n\nTwo years ago, he set up a group called India Against Corruption aimed at putting pressure on the government to bring about tough anti-corruption laws.\n\nThe rest, as the villagers say, is history. [...] The rest, as the villagers say, is history.\n\nTara Chand Sharma, a village elder, says with an exaggerated gesture of his hands: \"My chest swells with pride that my grandson will be the chief minister of Delhi.\" He calls Mr Kejriwal his grandson since he knew his grandfather.\n\n\"The boy is dead honest. We need people like him as leaders.\"\n\nSanjay Kumar, another neighbour, is convinced Mr Kejriwal's \"clean image\" was the legacy of his \"generous but honest family\".\n\nMr Kejriwal's uncle Girdhari Lal and a few other elders in the family clearly remember him as being studious.\n\n\"He never messed with anyone in school. On a few occasions we saw him, we found him glued to his text books. He was always reading,\" says Mr Lal."
