But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative.

One of the most valuable impressions Incubate Nepal has left on me is that one should not strive for perfection; instead, being honest, authentic, and dedicated is sufficient. Learning hard skills, soft skills, and diversity have all had a significant impact on my way of seeing things. Everyone in the Incubate Nepal Family is so welcoming and full of life experiences. My mentor, Anamika didi, and my teammates have been so supportive that they have always made time to sit down and teach me in a variety of ways, whether in research or in life.
