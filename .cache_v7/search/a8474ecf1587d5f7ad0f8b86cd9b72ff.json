Ha is interested in how different sensory modalities shape behaviors and plans to pursue a Ph.D. degree. Outside the lab, Ha works with the Center for Teaching and Learning and the Strategic Learning Center to help improve the teaching and learning on campus. In his free time, you would find him taking photographs or biking along the Norwottuck Rail Trail, trying out new coffee recipes, or jamming with friends with his cajon. Learn more about him here: \n\n#### Shirley Fu '26 [...] #### Allie Platt '26\n\n'26 Neuroscience Thesis Student  \n Allie Platt (she/her) is a senior from Brooklyn, New York. She is majoring in neuroscience on the pre-med track. Outside the lab, she is co-founder and co-president of the figure skating club, an EMT on ACEMS, and a Peer Educator. In her free time, she loves to listen to music (tune in to Hyperfixstation on WAMH), explore a new coffee shop, and travel.\n\n#### Ha Dong '26 [...] '22 Neuroscience Thesis Student  \n Former 2019 Summer Research Student"
