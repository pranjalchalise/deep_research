      "snippet": "Clifton Phifer Lee was born on August 30, 1978, in Benton, Arkansas, to Steve and Sharon Lee. His father was a local firefighter and one-time city council member. He was named Clifton after his maternal grandfather, while Phifer was his mother's maiden name. Both of his parents were high school athletes: Steve was a wide receiver for the football team at Benton High School \"Benton High School (Arkansas)\"), while Sharon, despite missing one hand from a birth defect, was a pitcher for a local softball team. Although he also played football and basketball, Lee's primary focus in high school was on baseball, where his former coach described him as a hard thrower who had trouble with his pitch command. College baseball coach Norm DeBriyn referred to Lee as a \"can't-miss guy\" upon seeing him [...] 75. ^ a b Weir, Josh (October 25, 2008). \"The Sporting News names All-Star Team\". The Repository.

      "snippet": "In 1979, Patrick Reusse, long-time sports columnist for the local dailies, headlined one of his columns: “Jimmy Lee—‘Fun to Be Around’ ” (St. Paul Dispatch, November 28, 1979). Reusse told his readers, “Minnesota baseball coach Dick Siebert used Lee regularly for Big Ten games. Siebert told me when he talked to the other coaches, they would say, ‘Get the black guy to work that series . . . not that Irishman.’ ” The Irishman referred to here is George Sweeney, another sports official who was quoted in Reusse’s column as saying, “You also learned from Jimmy. He always said a basketball official had to carry a wise whistle, and a\"er you worked with him a few times, you saw what he meant: ‘Let the kids decide the game.’ ” [...] Finally, a true Rondo and Minnesota legend was given his due and honored for who he was: an outstanding sports official, an outstanding person who cared for others, a man who worked hard and gave so much! Jimmy Lee was really a very complex individual. Taking into account his modest beginnings, his sustained love of sports, and his accomplishments, it’s easy to see that he touched so many lives in Minnesota, particularly in St. Paul. It’s clear he was more than just that man who blew a whistle, called balls and strikes, did very well on the golf course, and worked hard raising his family, with plenty of time to serve at St. Peter Claver Catholic Church. I only wish that he were here now so that I could tell him, we’re all so proud of you, Jimmy Lee! [...] Jimmy’s popularity. His talents benefited hundreds of players, coaches, and fans in multiple sports and on multiple levels."
