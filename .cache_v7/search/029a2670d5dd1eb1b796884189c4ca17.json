      "snippet": "As a leader in open‑source agent development, LangChain’s bread and butter is building, orchestrating, and deploying agents seamlessly for developers and non‑technical users alike. To advance this mission, Brace Sproul, Head of Applied AI, and his team built a cloud‑hosted coding agent that runs autonomously end to end. To open-source it reliably, they needed to nail one thing: their sandbox partner. [...] #### If anybody asked me which runtime platform to use, I'm going to 100% say Daytona every time. With their SDK, we never have to worry about an agent leaking or taking actions that it shouldn't. I haven't seen this anywhere else.\n\nBrace Sproul\n\nHead of Applied AI at LangChain\n\n###### MORE CUSTOMER STORIES\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona##### How Orchids Powers the World's First AI Full-Stack Engineer With Daytona\n\n##### How Orchids Powers the World's First AI Full-Stack Engineer With Daytona [...] langchain.com\n\nlangchain.com\n\nLinkedin\n\nLinkedin\n\nLinkedin\n\nLearn how the leading open-source agent engineering platform partnered with Daytona to ensure secure, instant, and persistent sandboxes for their production-ready coding agent.\n\n#### Our mission is to be the one place developers go for all their agent needs.

      "snippet": "“What about a biblical view of profits? he continued. “Yes, I could do that.” “How about caring for the poor? Could you write one on that?” I was terribly puzzled by this point. Hesitantly I responded, “I suppose if I had enough time I could.” “Do you think you could do ten such papers?” “Yes.” “Well if you did, then you’d have a book. That’s what I think you should do this summer as your job. When you are done I’ll go through it and then we’ll find a publisher.”\n\nThat book, Money Matters, with various updates, retitles (it’s now called Biblical Economics) and revisions, under various publishers, has been in print just under forty years. And that is how one gifted and accomplished author got an uncertain teenager to write his first book. [...] Trouble is, of course, that resting in the work of Christ for you, repenting and believing, isn’t the same thing as pushing button A rather than button B. It requires, you know, actually repenting and believing. Still, many hoped that given Mr. Adam’s admittedly weak biblical training, that maybe there was reason to hope. When a dog can play checkers, it is silly to criticize his strategy.  \nThis is what he wrote: [...] I love writing. Which is why I love helping others to do the same. Five years ago I started The Purpose Driven Write. My purpose is to help writers get their writing polished brilliant enough to earn and find an audience. I’ve been blessed to do everything from taking others’ ideas and putting them in book form to laying out the broad outline to actual coaching writing to substantive editing to buffing a final draft to a sparkling sheen."
