CONTEXT 10 Mental Health and Our Changing Climate: Impacts, Inequities, Responses OUR CHANGING CLIMATE: A PRIMER Our climate is changing at an accelerating rate and continues to have profound impacts on human health. This change jeopardizes not only physical health but also mental health. This section provides a primer on the geophysical impacts of climate change.1 Climate Change Is Accelerating at an Unprecedented and Alarming Rate From wildfires and drought in the west to excessive flooding in the midwest and east, stronger storms in the east, record-breaking hurricanes in the south, Alaskan communities threatened by rising seas, and intense heat in all areas of the country, the United States is experiencing [...] Longer term climate change can cause equally significant mental health impacts. Heat can fuel mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, vascular dementia, use of emergency mental health services, suicide, interpersonal aggression, and violence. Drought can lead to stress, anxiety, depression, uncertainty, shame, humiliation, and suicide, particularly amongst farmers. Air pollution has been linked to increased anxiety and use of mental health services, lower happiness and life satisfaction, and other negative well-being impacts. Changes in the local environment can cause grief, emotional pain, disorientation, and poor work performance as well as harm interpersonal relationships and self-esteem. Displacement can cause a range of negative mental health impacts due to loss of place,"

He grew up in New Haven, CT, and, despite having no formal family connections to Yale, managed to make use of its munificent resources not only by sneaking into parties, but by finding the secret subterranean tunnels and roof passages that made for ideal hangouts. Yet, by daylight, Mike took college classes at Yale as a precocious high school student. But it was Brad Wright at UConn who turned Vuolo on to the path of research and the life of a professor."

      "snippet": "The process of locating interviewees grew organically. This entire project, in fact, stemmed from a first, informal interview. While completing my undergraduate studies at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, a friend suggested I visit Bloodroot Fem-inist Vegetarian Restaurant, located forty minutes away in Bridge-port, Connecticut. An initial five-minute chat with the owners Selma Miriam and Noel Furie in 2011 led to more than a dozen formal interviews with feminist restaurant, cafe, and coffeehouse founders, staff, and customers around the United States. Locating the inter-viewees was made possible in two ways. The first method consisted of finding the name of a feminist business owner in a feminist peri-odical, advertisement, or in an archive. I would then conduct internet [...] traces remained in the archives. A business card, an event poster, or a mention in a musician’s liner notes was sometimes the only remaining trace of a feminist restaurant’s existence. Therefore, this project would not have been possible if archival materials were the only available source. I also relied on feminist literary materials such as feminist and lesbian periodicals, magazines, and travel guides (including every available edition of Gaia’s Guide). Oral histories were what truly made this project possible, however. The difficulty of writing a social history of marginalized peoples is that their records are less likely to be preserved in archives.34 I conducted 21 Introduction a series of interviews with the founders, staff, and customers of fem-inist restaurants, cafes, and [...] of Harvard University and was willing to be interviewed. Businesses that have operated for a longer period generated a greater paper trail. Restaurants that went out of business after a few months of operation were less likely to retain their files and the owners were less likely to donate their files to an archive. Furthermore, despite having gathered materials from 29 Introduction nineteen archives and collections, I was still very dependent on just a few women’s recollections. For most of my case studies, even if the information came from flyers, meeting minutes, and interviews, oftentimes the narrative of a restaurant’s history came from a single perspective without corroboration. Just as there are challenges in piecing together a restaurant’s history from a few scraps of text, it is"
