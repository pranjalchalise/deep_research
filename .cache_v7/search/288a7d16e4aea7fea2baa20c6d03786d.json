      "snippet": "Lee's research in this field was praised by prominent theoretical physicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar2 in a letter recommending Lee’s appointment to the Institute as a Member. Chandrasekhar’s letter reads: “My association with Mr. Lee has convinced me of his ability and originality. He has an exceptional aptitude and curiosity for theoretical physics.” Lee’s initial area of interest, white dwarf stars, continues to captivate scholars within the astrophysics group at the Institute. Recent research by Martin A. and Helen Chooljian Member Sihao Cheng, published in Nature, proposes a new theory to explain why a population of such stars stopped cooling for ten billion years. [...] Throughout his distinguished career, Lee made significant advancements in theoretical physics, authoring more than 300 research papers and several influential books. Most notably, in 1957, during his time at IAS, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics alongside his Institute colleague Chen-Ning Yang (楊振寧), Member (1949–54) and Faculty (1955–66) in the School of Mathematics/Natural Sciences. The pair were awarded the Prize for their revolutionary work on parity violation in weak interactions, which fundamentally changed our understanding of the laws of physics. [...] Although best known for his contributions to the field of particle physics, Lee’s early work focused on stellar astrophysics. In 1950, he completed his doctoral studies with a thesis on the hydrogen composition of white dwarf stars. His research demonstrated that these stellar remnants contain minimal hydrogen, specifically less than 1% of their mass. This provided strong evidence that white dwarfs represent the final evolutionary stage for most stars."

      "snippet": "Along with his collaborator Chen Ning Yang, T. D. Lee was the first Chinese Nobel Prize laureate. He received the prize when he was just 31 years old, which made him the youngest scientist to receive this prestigious award after World War II. In his more than 300 papers, Lee has made momentous contributions to various branches of theoretical physics, including particle physics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, astrophysics and hydrodynamics. The work that gained Lee and Yang the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics was the analysis of the status of parity conservation in weak interactions, carried out in 1956. This research led to the experimental discovery that neither parity (P) nor charge conjugation (C) is conserved in weak interactions. The words written [...] After the Nobel-rewarded research of the period 1956-57, Lee continued his fruitful collaboration with Yang until 1961, also returning for three years to the Institute for Advanced Study. In this period Lee, along with Yang and other collaborators, explored several topics, including various aspects of weak interactions and the many-body problem in quantum statistics. In the branch of weak interaction, it is worth mentioning their investigations on the mass of the hypothetical heavy bosons mediating the weak interactions. As for statistical mechanics, Lee and Yang studied the behaviour of a Bose system of quantum spheres. By formulating a method called “binary collision method,” they provided a systematic way to compute the virial coefficients of a dilute quantum gas.

      "snippet": "Lee’s own collected scientific papers total some 2,400 pages of research that has reshaped the understanding of the physical world. He has made significant contributions in the fields of astrophysics, statistical mechanics, field theory and turbulence, solving several problems of longstanding and great complexity. And his advances in particle physics are providing the underpinnings for new breakthroughs that will be made possible by the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator near Geneva.\n\nSaid William Zajc, physics department chair, “It is impossible to overstate T.D.’s influence on the Department of Physics, on Columbia and on the entire field of physics.” [...] The Chinese-born Lee earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago with a thesis titled Hydrogen Content of White Dwarf Stars. He was the doctoral student of another Columbia legend and Nobel laureate, Enrico Fermi, who, along with J. Robert Oppenheimer, is remembered as the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nIndeed, it was Oppenheimer who hired Lee in 1951 as a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, praising him as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists of his time. Lee’s discoveries, he said, were characterized by “a remarkable freshness, versatility and style.”\n\nThe Columbia physics department that Lee joined in the mid-1950s was already the stuff of legend, with nearly a dozen faculty members who had already won Nobel Prizes or would go on to win one. [...] When Lee was asked to single out some of his career highlights at Columbia, he demurred. “It’s almost like, in the evening you look at the sky—is there one star that you particularly like?”\n\nIn addition to his teaching and research at Columbia, Lee worked throughout his career to promote scientific education in China, as well as international cooperation between China and the U.S. in the areas of education and research."

      "snippet": "Professor Lee's research focused on the possibility to control the energies of the reagents, and to understand the dependence of chemical reactivity on molecular orientation, among other studies related to the nature of reaction intermediates, decay dynamics, and identifying complex reaction mechanisms. To do so, Professor Lee used a breakthrough laboratory technique at the time, called the \"crossed molecular beams technique\", where the information derived from the measurements of angular and velocity distributions allowed him and his team to understand the dynamics of elementary chemical reactions.\n\nIn 2021, Lee donated his Nobel Prize medal to the National Museum of Taiwan History for exhibition.\n\n## Later career\n\n[edit] [...] ## Later career\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring his tenure, Lee has worked to create new research institutes, advance scientific research within Taiwan, and to recruit and cultivate top scholars for the Academia Sinica.\n\nIn 2010, Lee said that global warming would be much more serious than scientists previously thought, and that Taiwanese people needed to cut their per-capita carbon emissions from the current 12 tons per year to just three. This would take more than a few slogans, turning off the lights for one hour, or cutting meat consumption, noting: \"We will have to learn to live the simple lives of our ancestors.\" Without such efforts, he said, \"Taiwanese will be unable to survive long into the future\". [...] Lee is a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, and honorary director of the Nagoya University Institute for Advanced Study along with Ryoji Noyori. He was awarded the Nobel with John C. Polanyi and Dudley R. Herschbach for \"contributions to the dynamics of chemical elementary processes\". He was the first Taiwanese person be awarded the Nobel Prize. His research in physical chemistry concerned the use of advanced chemical kinetics techniques to investigate and manipulate the behavior of chemical reactions using crossed molecular beams. From 1994 to 2006, Lee served as the President of the Academia Sinica. In 2011, he was elected head of the International Council for Science.\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]"

      "snippet": "In the early 1960s, Lee and collaborators initiated the important field of high-energy neutrino physics. In 1964, Lee, with M. Nauenberg, analyzed the divergences connected with particles of zero rest mass, and described a general method known as the KLN theorem for dealing with these divergences, which still plays an important role in contemporary work in QCD, with its massless, self-interacting gluons. In 1974–75, Lee published several papers on \"A New Form of Matter in High Density\", which led to the modern field of RHIC physics, now dominating the entire high-energy nuclear physics field.[citation needed] [...] From 1997 to 2003, Lee was director of the RIKEN-BNL Research Center (now director emeritus), which together with other researchers from Columbia, completed a 1 teraflops supercomputer QCDSP for lattice QCD in 1998 and a 10 teraflops QCDOC machine in 2001.[citation needed] Leading up to 2005, Lee and Richard M. Friedberg developed a new method to solve the Schrödinger equation, leading to convergent iterative solutions for the long-standing quantum degenerate double-wall potential and other instanton problems. They also did work on the neutrino mapping matrix. [...] However, again disrupted by a further Japanese invasion, Lee continued at the National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming the next year in 1945, where he studied with Professor Wu Ta-You.\n\n### Life and research in the U.S.\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Wu Experiment and Weak Interaction\n\nProfessor Wu nominated Lee for a Chinese government fellowship for graduate study in the United States. In 1946, Lee went to the University of Chicago and was selected by Professor Enrico Fermi to become his PhD student. Lee received his PhD under Fermi in 1950 for his research work Hydrogen Content of White Dwarf Stars. Lee served as research associate and lecturer in physics at the University of California at Berkeley from 1950 to 1951."
