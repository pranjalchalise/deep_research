Lee |\n| Estate | Stratford Hall \"Stratford Hall (plantation)\") |\n\nThe Lee family of the United States is a historically significant Virginia and Maryland political family, whose many prominent members are known for their accomplishments in politics and the military. The family became prominent when English merchant and politician, Richard Lee I (\"The Immigrant\") immigrated to the Colony of Virginia in 1639 and made his fortune managing a tobacco plantation worked by enslaved Africans. [...] Most recently, family members have marked over two hundred years of political service in the United States, as Blair Lee III (1916–1985, served 1971–1979), a descendant of Richard Henry Lee, served as the second Lieutenant Governor of Maryland when the office was revived, from 1971 to 1979 and Acting Governor of Maryland from 1977 to 1979. Charles Carter Lee, a descendant of Henry Lee III and a Superior Court Judge in Los Angeles County, California was named the U.S. team's Chef de Mission by the United States Olympic Committee for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Society of the Lees of Virginia, composed of descendants of Richard Lee I, was organised in 1921 and supports research on the family and preservation of associated historical sites.\n\n## History\n\n[edit] [...] Members of the family include Thomas Lee \"Thomas Lee (Virginia colonist)\") (1690–1750), a founder of the Ohio Company and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses; Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734–1797) and Richard Henry Lee (1732–1794), signers of the American Declaration of Independence, with Richard Lee also serving as one of Virginia's inaugural U.S. Senators; Henry \"Light-Horse Harry\" Lee (1756–1818), lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army and Governor of Virginia; Thomas Sim Lee (1745–1819), Governor of Maryland and lastly, and most famous, General Robert E. Lee (1807–1870), commander of the Army of Northern Virginia of the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War (1861–1865).

      "snippet": "## Rise to Political Prominence\n\nThe Lee brothers entered the political sphere in 1755, when Philip Lee was appointed to the House of Burgesses, and in 1757 Richard Henry Lee was appointed to his first public service position: justice of the peace for Westmoreland County. The following year, Philip Lee was appointed to the governor’s Council, and Richard Henry Lee won election to the seat in the House of Burgesses vacated by his eldest brother. His brothers Thomas Ludwell Lee and Francis Lightfoot Lee soon joined him there as the representatives from Stafford and Loudoun counties, respectively. Together, the Stratford Lees became a formidable voting bloc, working closely with Virginia’s new lieutenant governor, Robert Dinwiddie, to implement policy. [...] Richard Henry Lee was a planter, merchant, politician, and a member of the prominent Lee family of Virginia. Son of Thomas Lee, Richard Henry Lee pursued his father’s interest in westward expansion and was a key political figure during the American Revolution (1775–1783): it was Lee who, at the Second Continental Congress in 1776, made the motion to declare independence from Britain. Lee began his career as a justice of the peace for Westmoreland County (1757); he later served as a member of the House of Burgesses (1758–1775), the House of Delegates (1777, 1780, 1785), and the United States Senate (1789–1792). He also represented Virginia at the two Continental Congresses (1774–1779, 1784–1787) and served as president of Congress in 1784. In 1792 Lee retired from public service, citing [...] On June 25, 1788, Virginia ratified the U.S. Constitution; on November 8, Richard Henry Lee, along with William Grayson, was appointed to the new United States Senate for a four-year term. In his new role, Lee advocated for the constitutional amendments he had initially suggested. He tried to re-create his political partnership with his old ally (and current president of the Senate) John Adams, but Lee’s insistence on favoring a limited government drove the former friends apart. Ultimately, however, Lee gained a reputation in the Senate as a moderate and clear-headed lawmaker."

      "snippet": "Not only was he the founding father of Singapore, leading the nation to independence in 1965 after a long period of British colonial rule and a short-lived union with neighboring Malaysia, but he guided the island nation as prime minister for thirty-one straight years—making him the longest serving prime minister in world history. He also exercised significant structural influence on the country for more than two decades after stepping down as the head of government in 1990.\n\n> Few leaders have had as formative an impact on the politics, economy, social structure, and very character and fiber of a nation as Lee Kuan Yew did on Singapore. [...] Lee Kuan Yew played a pivotal role in transforming Singapore into an economic powerhouse. How meaningful is his legacy for Singapore and the region?\n\nFew leaders have had as formative an impact on the politics, economy, social structure, and very character and fiber of a nation as Lee Kuan Yew (LKY) did on Singapore. [...] The passing of Singapore’s towering founding father and first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew (1923–2015) on Monday marked a turning point for the island nation.Few leaders have shaped a nation as much as Lee did in Singapore, says CFR Adjunct Senior Fellow Karen Brooks. While Lee’s model of economic liberalization serves as an inspiration for many developing nations in the region, Brooks says the country “is sui generis on many levels, making it a difficult act for others to follow.” Acknowledging that Lee’s paternalistic governing style “often translated into a considerable suppression of democratic freedoms,” she says the country’s political system is being challenged by a younger generation of Singaporeans demanding new freedoms. However, the first significant test for post-Lee Singapore"

      "snippet": "Lee was elected Prime Minister of Singapore for 31 years, making him the longest-serving prime minister in the world at the time.\n\nMany world leaders have affirmed Lee's political knowledge as being insightful. Such supporters include former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher, who remarked that Lee was \"never wrong\", and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Former President of the United States Barack Obama stated that he \"personally appreciated [Lee's] wisdom.\" Former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe stated that Lee was \"one of the greatest leaders of modern times that Asia has ever produced.\" Lee Kuan Yew himself admired leaders like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping during interviews and speeches.\n\n## Foreign policy\n\n[edit]\n\n### Malaysia\n\n[edit] [...] Lee's policies and views on race have drawn both praise for their political pragmatism and success as well as criticism for being racially prejudiced; in 1997 he stated, for instance, that \"the blacks on average score 85 per cent on IQ and it is accurate, nothing to do with culture. The whites score on average 100. Asians score more … the Bell curve authors put it at least 10 points higher\". Lee's policies on race are regarded to have quashed historical racial tensions in Singapore, placing emphasis on multiracialism and equal protection under the law in the face of advocacy for special privileges granted to certain races. As prime minister, Lee aggressively promoted racial integration through his policies on language and culture, which many have described as social engineering \"Social [...] Lee was an outspoken critic of Western ideals of democracy, stating that \"with a few exceptions, democracy has not brought good government to developing countries.\" He argued that in states such as China, the concept of democracy was simply \"not workable\", because of the large population size that had to be canvassed, while in India, the results of democracy \"have not been spectacular\". He believed in the state interference of the media and personal lives of citizens. He has been criticised for using his political power to wage lawsuits to bankrupt and imprison his political opponents, as in the case of J. B. Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan. Francis Seow, the former solicitor-general of Singapore, has described Lee as such:"

      "snippet": "During his studies, Lee's political convictions and anti-colonial sentiments were hardened by personal experiences and an increasing belief that the British were ruling Singapore for their own benefit. He supported the Labour Party \"Labour Party (UK)\") against the Conservatives \"Conservative Party (UK)\") whom he perceived as opposing decolonisation. In the leadup to the 1950 United Kingdom general election, Lee engaged in politics for the first time and actively campaigned for a friend, David Widdicombe \"David Widdicombe (QC)\") in Totnes \"Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)\") constituency, driving Widdicombe around in a lorry and delivering several speeches on his behalf. [...] The rapid Japanese victory in the Malaya and Singapore campaign had a major impact on Lee as he recalled: \"In 70 days of surprises, upsets and stupidities, British colonial society was shattered, and with it all the assumptions of the Englishman's superiority\". In a radio broadcast made in 1961, Lee said he \"emerged [from the war] determined that no one—neither Japanese nor British—had the right to push and kick us around... (and) that we could govern ourselves.\" It also influenced his perceptions of raw power and the effectiveness of harsh punishment in deterring crime.\n\n### University, marriage and politics\n\n[edit] [...] The riot led the public to perceive the PAP as being led by \"young, immature and troublesome politicians\", resulting in a shortfall of new members. It deepened the divide between two emerging factions, with Lee's faction advocating Fabian's brand of socialism for gradual reform and Lim's faction, later described by Fong as \"favour(ing) a more radical approach\". Lee was convinced that Lim and Fong's influence were pushing the party toward \"political disaster\". After consulting his allies Toh Chin Chye, S. Rajaratnam and Byrne, Lee censured the two men privately and demanded they change strategies or leave the party."

      "snippet": "Lee Kuan Yew (born September 16, 1923, Singapore—died March 23, 2015, Singapore) was a politician and lawyer who was prime minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. Widely regarded as the founding father of modern Singapore, Lee transformed the city-state from a small, resource-deficient British colony with high rates of illiteracy into the most prosperous country in Southeast Asia. Under his leadership, Singapore developed a robust economy with one of the highest GDP per capita figures in Asia. Throughout the 21st century, Singapore would continue its upward trajectory. As of 2023, Singapore had a higher GDP per capita than the United States and one of the world’s strongest passports, enabling visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to more than 190 countries. [...] ## Leadership and governance\n\nLee’s dominance of the country’s political life was made easier when the main opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis, decided to boycott Parliament from 1966, following large-scale detainment of left-wing leaders. As a result, the PAP won every seat in the chamber in the elections of 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1980, after which opposition parties managed to claim one or two seats. To maintain control, Lee sometimes resorted to press censorship to stifle left-wing dissent over his government’s fundamental policies. [...] See all related content\n\nLee’s successor as prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, named Lee to the cabinet position of senior minister, from which Lee continued to exercise considerable political influence. Upon Goh’s resignation as prime minister in 2004 (he was succeeded by Lee’s son Lee Hsien Loong), Goh became senior minister, while the elder Lee remained in the cabinet as “minister mentor,” a position he held until 2011, when he finally stepped down from the cabinet. He held his seat in Parliament until his death, however, winning reelection in 1991, 1997, 2001, 2006, and 2011.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica This article was most recently revised and updated by Ethan Teekah."
