His research has centered on the discovery and characterization of aquatic pathogens, particularly infectious and emerging infectious diseases of economically important aquaculture species in Asia. His research group has investigated and developed detection methods for a number of emerging pathogens in tilapia, Asian sea bass, and whiteleg shrimp. He's also working on fish vaccine development and other disease-control strategies, such as nanobubble technology, and immunostimulants. He has authored over 75 international peer-reviewed articles related to this field.\n\nSelected news links: [...] Selected news links:\n\n Asia's race to outsmart antimicrobial resistance - Asia Research News, March 8, 2022\n Vaccinating Nile tilapia against Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) - Global Seafood, June 6, 2022\n Advanced diagnostic approaches for fish disease are welcome, but sometimes simpler is better - Fish Health Forum\n FISH JACUZZIS (!) as a Way to Reduce Infectious Diseases in Aquaculture - THE 1st International Conference on Sustainable Aquaculture (AQUA-Thailand)\n\n### Selected publications"
