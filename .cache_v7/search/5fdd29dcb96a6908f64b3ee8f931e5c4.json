It can receive messages from users at any time during the process and incorporate them into the state. Check out the slides for diagrams explaining each agent:  And the code:  I found the takeaways really interesting: \\ Summarization is hard: Especially with code changes that can get quite long, you literally can't send the entire context history to the LLM, and highly detailed old diffs may distract it.

      "snippet": "R.C. Sproul\nThe Applicability of God’s Word\n\nHow can we as Christians ascertain when God’s Word was applicable only to a certain culture and therefore may not be applicable to us today?The real question here is, Is everything that is set forth in Scripture to be applied to all people of all time and of all cultures? I don’t know any biblical scholar who would argue that everything set forth in Scripture applies to all people at all times. Since Jesus sent out the seventy and he told them not to wear shoes, does that mean that evangelists today would be disobedient unless they preached in their bare feet? Obviously that is an example of something practiced in the first-century culture that has no real application in our culture today. [...] More from this teacher\n\n### R.C. Sproul\n\nDr. R.C. Sproul (1939–2017) was founder of Ligonier Ministries, first minister of preaching and teaching at Saint Andrew’s Chapel in Sanford, Fla., and first president of Reformation Bible College.

My rule of thumb: We are to study to try to discern a difference between principle and custom. But if after having studied we can’t discern, I would rather treat something that may be a first-century custom as an eternal principle than risk being guilty of taking an eternal principle of God and treating it as a first-century custom.\n\nPromotion\n\nFor Your Gift of Any Amount\n\nGet 2 books to extend your ministry in 2026, plus 2 more to share.\n\nMore from this teacher\n\n### R.C.
