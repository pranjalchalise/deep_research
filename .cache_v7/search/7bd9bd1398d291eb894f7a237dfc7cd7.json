He tried to find a compromise between the two sides, but it did not work and made the problems worse.

He served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate. Pierce dominated the Democratic Party in New Hampshire during the 1830s and 1840s, when Democrats controlled the state’s political affairs. He also became an influential figure in the Democratic Party nationally. Throughout his career, Pierce believed ardently that the federal union between the states must be preserved at all costs. Although he was personally opposed to slavery, he argued that slavery was protected in the U.S. Constitution and therefore the federal government must support it. In the 1830s, many political leaders shared this view, but public"

      "snippet": "Franklin Pierce (born November 23, 1804, Hillsboro, New Hampshire, U.S.—died October 8, 1869, Concord, New Hampshire) was the 14th president of the United States (1853–57). He failed to deal effectively with the corroding sectional controversy over slavery in the decade preceding the American Civil War (1861–65).\n\n## Early life and career\n\nThe son of a governor of New Hampshire, Benjamin Pierce, and the former Anna Kendrick, Franklin Pierce attended Bowdoin College in Maine, studied law in Northampton, Massachusetts, and was admitted to the bar in 1827. He married Jane Means Appleton, whose father was president of Bowdoin, in 1834. [...] Pierce entered political life in New Hampshire as a Democrat, serving in the state legislature (1829–33), the U.S. House of Representatives (1833–37), and the Senate (1837–42). Handsome, affable, charming, and possessed of a certain superficial brilliance, Pierce made many friends in Congress, but his career there was otherwise undistinguished. He was a devoted supporter of Pres. Andrew Jackson but was continually overshadowed by older and more prominent men on the national scene. Resigning from the Senate for personal reasons, he returned to Concord, where he resumed his law practice and also served as federal district attorney.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nU.S. Presidents and Their Years in Office Quiz [...] At the time of his election, Pierce, age 47, was the youngest man to have been elected to the presidency. Representing the Eastern element of the Democratic Party, which was inclined for the sake of harmony and business prosperity to oppose antislavery agitation and generally to placate Southern opinion, Pierce tried to promote sectional unity by filling his cabinet with extremists from both sides of the slavery debate. He also attempted to sidestep the fierce sectional antagonisms of the domestic scene by ambitiously and aggressively promoting the extension of U.S. territorial and commercial interests abroad. In an effort to buy the island of Cuba from Spain, he ordered the U.S. minister to Spain, Pierre Soulé, to try to secure the influence of European financiers on the Spanish"
