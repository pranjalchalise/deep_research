      "snippet": "This includes weighing in on the debate over immigration in the United Kingdom and France, as well as calling for the U.K.'s King Charles III to dissolve Parliament. Musk also made controversial waves with his alleged support of AfD, a far right party in Germany accused of Nazi sympathies and labeled by Germany's intelligence domestic agency to be extremist. While AfD was boxed out of the government coalition following the country's election, it saw the best results for a far right party in Germany since World War II, as \"voter support flocks to AfD,\" said The Wall Street Journal. This is one area where the Trump administration and Musk continue agree post-rift, as Vice President J.D. Vance has praised AfD and criticized Germany for labeling it extremist. [...] ## Purchasing Twitter\n\nMusk controversially acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, handing him control of one of the world's largest social media brands. Immediately after his purchase, there were major concerns over a few changes he made to the platform, which he rebranded as X.\n\nAntisemitic and racist tweets spiked after Musk's acquisition; in the first 24 hours after his purchase, more than \"1200 tweets and retweets\" had spread antisemitism, the Anti-Defamation League said. Hateful rhetoric towards Black people also increased, with The Washington Post finding a 500% increase in the use of the N-word on X just half a day after Musk's purchase. [...] Newsletter \n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nTesla founder Elon Musk is embroiled in many controversies. This has been turbocharged in the wake of his government position following President Donald Trump's reelection — and his recent, eventual falling-out with the president. Many in the U.S. increasingly view him as a lightning rod figure.\n\n## Trump and DOGE\n\nMusk generated significant controversy for his closeness to President Donald Trump. Musk contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump get elected in 2024, according to FEC filings, and previously referred to himself as the president's \"first buddy.\""

      "snippet": "## Musk criticizes Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”\n\nShortly before announcing that his DOGE role was coming to its scheduled end, Musk criticized Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" in a public forum. During an interview with CBS, he agreed that the spending bill—which is now heading to the Senate—undermines the spending cuts brought about by DOGE.  \n  \n“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit,” Musk said. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don’t know if it can be both, [that’s] my personal opinion.” [...] ## Musk’s straight-arm salute at a Trump rally\n\nAt a celebratory rally after Trump’s inauguration, Musk’s White House career got off to a contentious start when he seemingly offered a straight-arm salute at the Capitol One Arena in Washington, D.C., as he excitedly told the crowd: “My heart goes out to you.”\n\nThe motion immediately garnered controversy, with some people, including history professors who study fascism and U.S. Representatives, expressing concern that the action was similar to a Nazi salute.\n\nSome, including the Anti-Defamation League, came to Musk’s defense, arguing that he was seemingly making an “awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm.” [...] Musk addressed the controversy himself, saying: “The radical leftists are really upset that they had to take time out of their busy day praising Hamas to call me a Nazi.”\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gestures as he speaks during the inaugural parade inside Capital One Arena, in Washington, DC, on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## DOGE employees resigning\n\nSeveral civil service employees resigned from DOGE, citing their refusal to use their expertise to “dismantle critical public services,” according to a joint resignation letter sent to the White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Feb. 25, that was obtained by the Associated Press.  \n  \nThe employees had worked for the United States Digital Service, but said their duties had been integrated into DOGE."

      "snippet": "The decision to align with Trump, and later publicly break from him, has led to political backlash and scrutiny from multiple fronts.\n\n...\n\n## What To Know\n\nAs of June 25, 55.1 percent of Americans viewed Elon Musk unfavorably, while 37 percent had a favorable opinion—a sharp shift from early 2024, when the numbers were roughly even, according to Silver Bulletin.\n\n\"Musk is still popular among Republicans, but he's less popular than he used to be and less popular than other Republican figures,\" elections analyst Eli McKown-Dawson wrote. [...] Politics Reporter\n\nNewsweek is a Trust Project member\n\nElon Musk's public image has reached its lowest point since 2024, as new polling shows that the billionaire's favorability has plunged following his involvement in President Donald Trump's administration and subsequent departure.\n\nOnce a relatively popular figure across political lines, Musk now finds himself with a net favorability rating of -18.1, according to data compiled by Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nMusk's decline in popularity comes in the wake of his public support for Trump during the 2024 election and his appointment as a \"special government employee,\" where he functioned as the informal head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). [...] Although Musk remains in positive territory with Republicans, his support has dropped significantly following his public fallout with Trump. The rift escalated this month after Musk suggested Trump was \"in the Epstein files,\" prompting Trump to threaten Musk's government contracts and subsidies.\n\nSilver called the split \"predictable,\" writing on Substack that Musk \"got nothing out of this; Trump used Musk and then dumped him.\"\n\nMusk has claimed he helped Trump win, saying, \"Without me, Trump would have lost the election.\" Silver pushed back: \"Elon's money certainly didn't help in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\" Musk reportedly donated about $300 million to Republican causes in 2024."

      "snippet": "The world’s richest man’s fall from grace has been a speedy one, having enjoyed the self-proclaimed status of “First Buddy” to Donald Trump – currying favor with the president and his stalwart MAGA base and leading controversial efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to slash spending.\n\nGallup put his “net favorability rate” at -4 at the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, following an explosive fallout between the pair in early June, in which they traded blows from their respective social media platforms, Musk was ousted from Trump’s inner circle – with the president even suggesting that the South African-born businessman “go back where he came from.”\n\nGallup now puts his “net favorability rate” at -28. [...] Gallup asked 1,000 random American adults between July 7 and July 21 what they thought of the figures, with 61 percent of respondents having an unfavorable opinion of the Tesla boss.\n\nOthers on the list included Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Joe Biden and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nThough the overwhelming majority had negative reactions towards him, 33 percent of respondents to the survey said they liked Musk, and six percent said they had no opinion on him at all.\n\nRecommended\n\n Trump’s approval rating sinks to 40%, the lowest of his term, new poll finds\n A bromance ends: Trump-Musk friendship goes from meteoric rise to epic meltdown in under a year\n Why Musk’s $29bn Tesla payout is a blessing in disguise\n Government defends Online Safety Act after X claims it threatens free speech [...] Gallup now puts his “net favorability rate” at -28.\n\nTrump’s lack of faith and endorsement have also mirrored that of Tesla’s stocks, which have been in steady decline. The electric vehicle manufacturer last month posted a 16 percent drop in net income for the second quarter of 2025 and a 12 percent fall in revenue for the same period.\n\nMusk and his reputation have even managed to turn people off EVs in general, according to a study by Williams College.\n\nWhile Trump’s favorability was better than his former bestie’s, the president still sits at “net favorability” of -16; 57 percent of respondents hold a negative view of the president and 41 hold a positive one. Only two percent had no opinion."

Among Democrats, Musk's net approval (positive minus negative) is -82 and -49 for independents.

[...] Tesla's stock has undergone a withering sell-off, and the CNBC All-America Economic survey finds more than 47% of the public have a negative view of the company. Another 27% are positive on the electric vehicle maker, while 24% are neutral. That compares with a third of the public who have a positive view of General Motors with 51% neutral and 10% negative.\n\nTesla has been under pressure with concern that its founder's controversial political activities in cutting government employment and backing President Donald Trump and Republicans could be alienating prospective buyers.
