      "snippet": "Marius has a conflicted attitude towards religion and spirituality, as he is the keeper of the shrine of Those Who Must Be Kept. Marius does not believe in divine power, and blames religious ideas for his own unwilling transformation into a vampire, which often brings him into conflict with other vampires as Christianity and the Children of Satan emerge in Europe. His lover Pandora accuses him of having \"made a religion out of reason.\"\n\n## Biography[]\n\n### Early Life[]\n\nMarius was a citizen of the Roman Gallic city of Massilia, born in approximately 30 BCE. He was the illegitimate child of a Keltoi woman from the land of Gaul and a wealthy Roman. [...] Marius was a scholar and chronicler by the age of twenty, traveling quite a lot and visiting all the great European cities. When he is twenty-five, he meets a ten year old girl named Lydia at the home of her father, a Roman senator, and is impressed by her interest in poetry. Marius asks to become betrothed to Lydia, with the intention that it will delay his own obligation to get married until she is of marriageable age. He is denied by her father, who explains to Lydia that this is the reason he was rejected. Lydia encounters Marius once more at a religious festival when she is fifteen, and informs him that she asked her father to allow them to get married, but was denied again due to Marius's lower social status. [...] Marius observes humanity from afar as his vampiric powers grow, and eventually goes to sleep in the temple around the year 1200, reawakening in 1482. He briefly returns to Rome, where he encounters and insults Santino, and becomes obsessed with with work of Botticelli in the Sistine Chapel. He travels to meet Botticelli in Florence, and is tempted to, but ultimately decides not to, give him the Dark Gift.\n\nMarius purchases a palazzo in Venice, intending to become a painter and gathering a group of apprentices to assist him. As he becomes more involved in Venetian society, he meets and falls in love with a courtesan named Bianca, but is distraught and decides he cannot make her into his companion when he learns that she is a murderer."

      "snippet": "### Early Life\n\nAround 157 BCE, Marius was born to a plebeian family in an Italian settlement called Ceraete, near Arpinum. None of Marius' ancestors had ever been elected to a Roman political office, and he even claimed to have been raised in poverty, which meant that he was not seriously expected to become a person of importance. [...] At an early age, he entered Rome's legions and served with integrity. Then, by parlaying his relationships with influential Romans and expounding his honorable military service, he entered the political arena and climbed the political ladder, thecursushonorum. He was first elected to the military tribuneship, then tribune of the plebs in 119 BCE, praetor in 115 BCE, and he was subsequently assigned to govern the province of Farther Spain. Throughout his early political career, he proved that he was an adept and conscientious politician. In fact, Marius \"won office after office, always so conducting himself in each of them as to be regarded worthy of a higher position than that which he was holding\" (Sallust, The War with Jugurtha, 63.5).\n\n### Jugurthine War [...] WHE Logo\n\n# Gaius Marius\n\n## Contents\n\nSubscribe to topic\nSubscribe to author\nPrint\nPDF\n\nMarc Hyden\nTranslations\n\nThis text is available in other languages:\n\nGaius Marius (by Franz Venhaus, CC BY-ND)\")\n\nGaius Marius (c. 157-86 BCE) was an accomplished military commander and politician who was acclaimed for saving Rome from the brink of collapse. Yet, unfortunately, his name has only survived in relative obscurity because his achievements were eclipsed by his ultimate fall. Despite his copious misdeeds, he should also be remembered for his stunning political and military successes and the indelible imprint that he left on Rome.\n\n### Early Life"

      "snippet": "many of the problems he faced during his early career in Rome show the difficulties that faced a \"new man\" (novus homo) in being accepted into the stratified upper echelons of Roman society, Marius – even as a young man – was not poor or even middle-class; he was most assuredly born into inherited wealth, gained most likely from large land holdings. In fact, his family's resources were definitely large enough to support not just one member of the family in Roman politics, but two: Marius's younger brother, Marcus Marius \"Marcus Marius (praetor 102 BC)\"), also entered Roman public life. [...] It would seem that even at this early stage of his military career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He was elected on the basis of his accomplishments, even though he was not known by sight to the electors, as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes. After election, he likely served Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus on the Balearic Islands, helping him win a triumph. Next, Marius possibly ran for the quaestorship after losing an election for local office in Arpinum. He may have stood for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to a local competitor. It is possible, however, that Marius never ran for the quaestorship at all, jumping directly to plebeian tribune. He likely participated in the major Roman victory at the Battle of the [...] #### As consul\n\n[edit]\n\nMarius was still in Africa when the Assembly elected him consul for 104 BC. At the start of his consulship, Marius returned from Africa in spectacular triumph, bringing Jugurtha and the riches of North Africa to awe the citizenry. Jugurtha, who had prophesied the purchase and destruction of Rome, met his end in a Roman prison after having been led through the streets of the city in chains. Marius was assigned (it is unclear whether by the Assembly or by sortition) the province of Gaul to deal with the Cimbric threat."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career"

      "snippet": "So who was Gaius Marius?\n\nHumble origins\n\nMarius started out in an equestrian family which, despite relative affluence, remained outside of Rome’s snobbish aristocracy. He married into a rich family, which gave him the political patronage he needed to become a tribune in 119 BC and a praetor in 115 BC. Serving as a governor in one of Rome’s Spanish provinces, Marius gained priceless military experience from his counter-insurgency campaigns against Rome’s tribal enemies. Carefully and meticulously, the Roman governor studied the hit-and-run tactics of his foes, allowing him to master the art of conquest."

      "snippet": "Marius rose through the ranks, making a name for himself politically at the same time. He, like many political men who came from plebeian families, had help from a patrician patron; Marius’ patron was the Metelli family, and he worked closely with Quintus Caecilius Metellus. After his election as plebeian tribune in 120 BCE, he began to alienate them with opposing political stances. This opposition cost him the aedileship a few years later and would present further problems down the road. After a term as propraetor in Further Spain, he returned to Rome in 113. He was now very wealthy, but still lacked the social bona fides of the senatorial class, so he married a Julia. This showed Rome without question that he was respectable; if a family as ancient as the Julio Caesari, a [...] Gaius Marius was what the Romans called a Novus Homo, a New Man, the first in his family to reach the highest office of the Roman Republic, the consulship. He was often described by his contemporaries as a provincial and a “man who knew no Greek,” a generic insult that meant he had no formal education. While it is true that he did come from a farming family in the rural area of Arpinum and his family was not one of the elite patrician families, he did have a formal education. Plutarch tells us that never bothered to learn Greek fully because he saw no use in learning the language of a conquered people. [...] In 109, Marius travelled to Numidia to become legate to his former patron, Quintus Metellus, who was one of Rome’s generals in the Jugurthine War. There was still enmity between the two men, and this was exacerbated their very different ways of conducting themselves with the soldiers. Metellus stayed distant and commanding, but Marius shared the work with those in his command. His willingness to do so, and to share in the poor provisions and quartering, earned him the respect and admiration of many, and did nothing to endear Metellus to them. This military reputation is one on which he would capitalize for Rome, and himself, in later years. As the summer of 108 came on, Marius requested leave to return to Rome in order to present himself as a candidate for the consulship;"
