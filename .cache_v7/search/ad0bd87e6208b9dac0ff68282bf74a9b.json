      "snippet": "FRAX underestimates fracture risk in patients with recent fractures, multiple osteoporosis-related fractures, and those at increased risk for falling. FRAX® is most useful in patients with low femoral neck BMD. Utilizing FRAX® in patients with low BMD at the lumbar spine but a relatively normal BMD at the femoral neck underestimates fracture risk in these individuals. Specifically, the WHO algorithm has not been validated for the use of lumbar spine BMD. NOF recommends treatment of individuals with osteoporosis of the lumbar spine as well as the hip.\nApplication of US-adapted FRAX® in the USA & FRAX® is intended for postmenopausal women and men age 50 and older; it is not intended for use in younger adults or children. [...] Biochemical markers of bone turnover may : & Predict risk of fracture independently of bone density in untreated patients & Predict rapidity of bone loss in untreated patients & Predict extent of fracture risk reduction when repeated after 3–6 months of treatment with FDA-approved therapies & Predict magnitude of BMD increases with FDA-approved therapies & Help determine adequacy of patient compliance and per-sistence with osteoporosis therapy & Help determine duration of “drug holiday” and when and if medication should be restarted. (Data are quite limited to support this use, but studies are underway.) Use of WHO FRAX® in the USA FRAX® was developed to calculate the 10-year probability of a hip fracture and the 10-year probability of a major osteopo-rotic fracture (defined as clinical [...] Osteoporosis: impact and overview Scope of the problem Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease in humans, representing a major public health problem as outlined in Bone Health and Osteoporosis: A Report of the Surgeon General (2004) . It is characterized by low bone mass, deterioration of bone tissue and disruption of bone architec-ture, compromised bone strength, and an increase in the risk of fracture. According to the WHO diagnostic classification, osteoporosis is defined by BMD at the hip or lumbar spine that is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below the mean BMD of a young-adult reference population. Osteopo-rosis is a risk factor for fracture just as hypertension is for stroke. The risk of fractures is highest in those with the lowest BMD; however, the majority of"

      "snippet": "One of the current challenges in tissue engineering for the treatment of osteoporosis is the development of a system for the controlled release of therapeutic substances that can improve their targeting. Injectable hydrogels are presented as a versatile option for different applications in tissue engineering thanks to their adaptability. Despite this, their clinical application is still scarce, and more studies are required to improve the aspects related to the use of polymeric biomaterials, their mechanical properties or their biodegradability . Zheng et al. analyzed different strategies based on hydrogels for the treatment of osteoporosis, concluding that the use of biomaterials based on combined natural and synthetic composites is the best therapeutic strategy. These hydrogels have low [...] The treatment gap is particularly marked in the case of hip fracture patients [121,122]. Kim and colleagues studied the use of osteoporosis medications for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fracture. Among a total of 86,202 patients with hip fracture, only 11 to 39% were treated with osteoporosis medication within 3 months after the fracture. Moreover, the adherence to osteoporosis treatment was also suboptimal . [...] In a recent study by Lu et al., it was observed that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from MSCs possessed therapeutic potential for the treatment of osteoporosis, similar to that of progenitor cells. To develop this idea, they focused on studying disease models, potential therapeutic targets and the molecular mechanisms of action. The use of EVs in osteoporosis has not yet been studied, but it is being studied in the treatment of cancer, renal and cardiovascular diseases and wound healing. Furthermore, the great advantage of this type of treatment is that it is completely cell-free, eliminating any possibility of rejection in the patient. This would facilitate its application in the clinic ."

      "snippet": "At the doses used for treatment of osteoporosis, AFF and ONJ are very rare. On the other hand, fragility fractures from untreated osteoporosis are very common. Out of 1,000 women, 500 will suffer a fracture during their lifetime unless they get treatment for osteoporosis. When treated appropriately, the benefits of osteoporosis medications outweigh the risks. [...] In rare cases, inflammation of the eye (uveitis) may occur. There have also been reports of osteonecrosis (death of bone cells or tissue) of the jaw (ONJ) in patients taking bisphosphonates. The risk of ONJ in people taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis appears to be very small for at least five years. ONJ is more common following high dose intravenous bisphosphonate treatments for cancer (such as Aredia® or Zometa®). You should practice good dental care and work closely with a doctor or dentist to reduce the risk of ONJ. [...] of osteoporosis • Treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as: o o History of osteoporotic fracture o o Multiple risk factors for fracture o o Patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy Abaloparatide is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous injection in a single-patient-use prefilled pen. Cumulative use of abaloparatide for more than 2 years during your lifetime is not recommended. You should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate."

      "snippet": "Treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hip fracture by up to 40%, vertebral fractures by 30-70% and, with some medications, reduce the risk for non-vertebral fractures by 15-20%.\n\nThere are two main types of treatment: anti-resorptive agents reduce bone destruction and therefore preserve bone mineral density (BMD), while anabolic agents stimulate bone formation, thereby increasing BMD.\n\nMedically approved drug therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis and prevention of fractures include:\n\n Bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid)\n Raloxifene and bazedoxifene\n Teriparatide and abaloparatide\n Denosumab\n Romosozumab\n Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT)\\\n\nNot all of these drugs are available in every country. [...] ## Treatment\n\nFor patients at high risk, drug treatments are needed to effectively reduce the risk of broken bones due to osteoporosis.\n\nToday there is a wider variety of osteoporosis treatment options than ever before. The type of treatment you are prescribed will depend on your individual risk profile. This includes the risk for a specific type of fracture (spine versus hip), other medical conditions, or medications you may take. Finally, cost and cost-effectiveness considerations, insurance plans and reimbursement policies will undoubtedly also influence your doctor’s recommendations of therapeutic options. [...] #### Importance of sticking with your treatment\n\nLike all medication, osteoporosis treatments can work only if they are taken properly. As reported for other chronic diseases, up to half of patients with osteoporosis stop their treatment after only one year. If you have been prescribed osteoporosis medication, you should keep in mind that by adhering to your treatment, you can benefit from larger increases in BMD, lose less bone mass, and reduce your fracture risk."

      "snippet": "Like the parathyroid hormone analogs, the sclerostin-binding analog romosozumab (Evenity) is an anabolic agent for patients at very high risk of fracture. Use of romosozumab is limited to one year based on the limited duration of studies to date. Treating with romosozumab for one year followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk compared with alendronate treatment for 24 months. Romosozumab use increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, and there is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration boxed warning against use in patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within one year. Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia and rarely can lead to osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture."
