      "snippet": "To compare the effectiveness of various braces, standardized research protocols are needed. The variability defining success of brace treatment in idiopathic scoliosis was addressed by Richards et al. and the SRS Committee on Bracing and Nonoperative Management  in an attempt to standardize parameters for effective and reliable comparisons of bracing studies. The recommendations for bracing study inclusion were patients 10 years or older, Risser sign 0 to 2, initial curve magnitude of 25° to 40°, and no prior treatment at the initiation of brace treatment. The outcome data should be determined from the percentage of patients with: less than 5° or greater than 6° of progression at maturity, curves exceeding 45° at maturity, and progression resulting in the recommendation for surgery. [...] ## Abstract\n\nSkeletally immature patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are at risk for curve progression. Although numerous nonoperative methods have been attempted, including physical therapy, exercise, massage, manipulation, and electrical stimulation, only bracing is effective in preventing curve progression and the subsequent need for surgery. Brace treatment is initiated as either full-time (TLSO, Boston) or nighttime (Charleston, Providence) wear, although patient compliance with either mode of bracing has been a documented problem. We review the natural history of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, identify the risks for curve progression, describe the types of braces available for treatment, and review the indications for and efficacy of brace treatment. [...] | Study | Type of brace | Comparison | Number of patients | Average initial curve | Conclusion |\n ---  ---  --- |\n| Nachemson and Peterson, 1995  | TLSO | Total | 286 | 25°–35° | Brace prevented progression of curve |\n| Observation | 129 |\n| Brace | 111 |\n| Allington and Bowen, 1996  | Wilmington | Total | 188 | < 30° | The difference in progression between full-time and part-time bracing was not significant |\n| Full-time | 36 |\n| Part-time | 32 | 30°–40° |\n| Full-time | 62 |\n| Part-time | 17 |\n| Katz et al., 1997  | Total |  | 319 | — | Boston brace more effective than Charleston in preventing curve progression |\n| Charleston | 166 | 32.9° |\n| Boston | 153 | 33.9° |\n| Howard et al., 1998  | Total |  | 170 |  | TLSO superior in preventing curve progression |\n| TLSO | 45 |"

      "snippet": "R.C. was biblically and theologically illiterate. Within the first two weeks of his Christian life, he read through the entire Bible, and was awakened for the first time to the holiness of God, especially through the Old Testament.\n\nIn February of 1958, R.C.’s girlfriend, Vesta—whom he met in first grade and had dated on and off since junior high—visited from her college in Ohio. After attending a prayer meeting with R.C., she too committed her life to Christ.\n\nThe summer after his junior year at Westminster and Vesta’s graduation from college, R.C. and Vesta were united in marriage on June 11, 1960.\n\nThe next year, Vesta worked at the school while R.C. wrote his senior philosophy thesis on “The Existential Implications of Moby Dick” and saw his beloved Pirates win the World Series. [...] Those two books, I think, first of all point out the transcendent majesty of God, and second, the sovereignty of God.\n\nThose two ideas so inform our whole understanding of God, of Christ, of ourselves, and of the whole gamut of Christian thought that it is the foundational material that I use to introduce people to these things. [...] Rather than returning to the Netherlands, the Sprouls stayed in the US, where he taught at Gordon College (Massachusetts) and then Conwell School of Theology (Philadelphia). He continued his studies under Berkouwer from a distance and returned in 1969 to take his matriculation exams, which enabled him to receive the “drs.” (doctorandus) degree—equivalent to a masters—which would have enabled him to begin writing a dissertation. But ministry endeavors prevailed, and he never did complete his dissertation and thus did not earn a PhD from Amsterdam. (He would later be granted a PhD from the unaccredited Whitefield Theological Seminary based upon all of his writing for the church.)"

A 15 % failure rate for brace-treated patients compared favourably with 45 % in the observation group. Risser 0–1, apex above T12, and a balanced spine were identified as predictors for curve progression . [...] results of 51 boys with a matched control group of 51 girls treated with a Boston brace, boys showed a significantly higher failure rate (31.4 vs. 21.6 %). Three of the boys but none of the girls had to be operated on. After excluding the non-compliant boys (14/51, 27.5 %), there was no difference in outcome if compared to girls. They conclude that although boys may have more compliance problems there is no reason to abandon bracing ."
