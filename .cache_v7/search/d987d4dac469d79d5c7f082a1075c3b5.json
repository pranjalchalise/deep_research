      "snippet": "Divisive slogans and partisan interests pursued at the expense of public welfare have long been chronic problems in Korean politics. Hatred, racism and extremism must indeed be curbed.\n\nHowever, the timing of Lee’s criticism raises questions, as the nation grapples with a deteriorating economy and heightened political tensions.\n\nThe Korean economy is reeling from the impact of the Donald Trump administration’s tariffs, while the depreciation of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar has added further pressure. Exporters, including automakers and semiconductor producers, are suffering from the delayed implementation of the Korea-U.S. tariff deal, as both sides are still negotiating the final joint fact sheet. [...] Lee did not specify which phrases he found problematic.\n\nPolitical banners are ubiquitous across the country, with some carrying accusations against China and the Chinese Communist Party over alleged interference in Korean politics. Others target Lee’s confidant, Kim Hyun-ji, who serves as secretary to the first lady’s office. Kim, a longtime aide who has worked with Lee for over a decade, is known to be one of his most trusted advisors.\n\nLee’s criticism of hatred and extremism is well-founded. As he noted, political banners are often divisive and radical, with opposition parties using them to inflame public sentiment against Lee and others. [...] The Korean public is demanding a convincing explanation from the presidential office on whether Lee or his deputies exerted influence over the prosecution’s unusual decision not to appeal the court ruling. The president himself is not free from the scandal, as he oversaw the controversial land development project when he served as mayor of Seongnam.\n\nThe timing of Lee’s recent denunciation of political banners as malicious tools that spread hatred and racism — and his vow to eliminate what he called “social ills” — is prompting the public to question his motives, as it coincides with growing public scrutiny of him and his office."

      "title": "The Paradox of Robert Edward Lee",
      "snippet": "Robert E. Lee remains as controversial today as he was in his own era, in part because of the contradictions he embodied. A critic of slavery and secession, he fought for the cause that embodied each. He was the only man ever offered the command of armies that opposed each other. Deemed one of the greatest of military minds, his side still lost. Then, he became one of the chief proponents of reconciliation, yet he held serious reservations pertaining to race and reconstruction. In his book, The Religious Life of Robert E. Lee, David Cox explores how Lee’s faith influenced his views and his actions. In this lecture, he will examine how Lee’s religious convictions guided two of his most important, if paradoxical, decisions: to resign his commission and side with Virginia in 1861, then to [...] his commission and side with Virginia in 1861, then to accept the presidency of Washington College in Lexington as a means of promoting the reconciliation he hoped to foster after the war. This latter decision in particular seemed to frame his sometimes paradoxical approach to controversies that arose in his later years."

      "snippet": "who along with Lee were critical to the Confederacy's battlefield success. But his two major strategic offensives into Union territory ended in failure, and his aggressive and risky tactics, especially at Gettysburg, resulted in high casualties at a time when the Confederacy had a shortage of manpower. His battlefield record, his views on race and slavery, and his legacy have been the subject of continuing debate and historical controversy. [...] Despite opposing secession, Lee said in January that \"we can with a clear conscience separate\" if all peaceful means failed. He agreed with secessionists in most areas, rejecting the Northern abolitionists' criticisms and their prevention of the expansion of slavery to the new western territories, and fear of the North's larger population. Lee supported the Crittenden Compromise, which would have constitutionally protected slavery. [...] Critical decisions came in May–June 1863, after Lee's smashing victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville. The western front was crumbling, as multiple uncoordinated Confederate armies were unable to handle General Ulysses S. Grant's campaign against Vicksburg. The top military advisers wanted to save Vicksburg, but Lee persuaded Davis to overrule them and authorize yet another invasion of the North. The immediate goal was to acquire urgently needed supplies from the rich farming districts of Pennsylvania; a long-term goal was to stimulate peace activity in the North by demonstrating the power of the South to invade. Lee's decision proved a significant strategic blunder and cost the Confederacy control of its western regions, and nearly cost Lee his own army as Union forces cut him off"

      "snippet": "Lee and Reconciliation\n\nWinik sees Lee as a symbol of reconciliation. And Lee certainly was that in many ways. Winik, however, accepts without criticism the early 20th century story of Lee kneeling beside a black church attendant at St. Paul’s in downtown Richmond in June of 1865. Richmond historian Philip J. Schwarz has written about the event–if it indeed happened at all–as open to interpretation concerning Lee’s supposed selfless, egalitarian attitude toward African Americans. [...] The Lee Family Digital Archive Blog\n\nDocumenting the Revolution, the Civil War, and Virginia\n\nThe Lee Family Digital Archive Blog\n\n# What Historians Keep Getting Wrong about Robert E. Lee\n\n2493043210_c61a1e947c_o\n\nThe Lee monument in Richmond. Source: Colin Woodward\n\nBy Colin Woodward\n\nLast month, historian Jay Winik, author of April 1865 and other history books, wrote a piece in the Washington Post on Robert E. Lee. The article attempted to extinguish the historical fire that began after White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly spoke about Robert E. Lee and his legacy. Many historians and pundits were critical of Kelly, who said that the Civil War happened because of a “lack of compromise,” and he praised Lee as an “honorable man.” [...] Executing Custis’s estate gave Lee fits, and he was glad when it was finally accomplished. The freeing of the Arlington slaves was not an act of philanthropy, but an instance of Lee executing a legal duty and freeing himself of a personal burden.\n\nIn the heated political climate of today, Lee’s defenders and detractors want Lee to be more committed on matters of race than he was. It is true, Lee never owned more than a few slaves himself. His attitude toward black people, however, was mostly one of indifference or condescension."
