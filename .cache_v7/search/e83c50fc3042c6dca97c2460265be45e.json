      "snippet": "1970s. They place feminism within the historical context of a politically charged time and portray activists as complex individuals who were engaged in multiple, often changing, political causes. Still, there is a gap in the literature on feminism during this period. While historians have shown the relationship between feminism and the sexual liber-ation movement, gay liberation, civil rights, Black power, Chicano lib-eration, the anti-nuclear movements, the peace movements, the food movements, and the environmental movements, no one has yet to speak of the intersections between all these movements. A spatial ap-proach to feminist restaurants allows for an analysis that incorporates all of them while still acknowledging change over time. This tech-nique thus enables a history of women’s [...] impact, showcase the histories of founders from diverse identity back-grounds, and illustrate the major themes in the book. Prioritizing geographic diversity was important as this project challenges the historiographical concentration on feminist move-ments during the 1970s and 1980s in New York City, the Eastern Seaboard, and San Francisco. Indeed, these cities contributed to the history of feminist restaurants, cafes, and coffeehouses and are not overlooked in this book. However, Iowa City, Portland, and Tampa had thriving feminist business communities (as can be seen in the maps of their feminist business nexus in 1981 in the appendix). In fact, as is apparent on the major map, feminist restaurants, cafes, and coffeehouses were spread all over the United States. Every state at some [...] Feminist restaurants prompt plenty of questions. One query raised is the relationship between the creation of feminist restaurants and the feminist discourse that searched for a solution to the “cook-ing problem”: the societal expectations that burdened women with the responsibility of domestic food production. Solutions proposed by feminist authors during the era included buying pre-made foods rather than cooking, sharing housework responsibilities with male partners, requesting wages for housework, joining communes includ-ing but not limited to separatist lesbian farming communities, and founding food co-operatives to share cooking responsibilities amongst groups of families. At the start of this project, I assumed that feminists during the 1970s and 1980s had founded these restaurants"
