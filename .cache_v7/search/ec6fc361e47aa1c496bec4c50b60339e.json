      "snippet": "Pierce favored expansion and a substantial reorganization of the military. Secretary of War Davis and Navy Secretary James C. Dobbin found the Army and Navy in poor condition, with insufficient forces, a reluctance to adopt new technology, and inefficient management. Under the Pierce administration, Commodore Matthew C. Perry visited Japan (a venture originally planned under Fillmore) in an effort to expand trade to the East. Perry wanted to encroach on Asia by force, but Pierce and Dobbin pushed him to remain diplomatic. Perry signed a modest trade treaty with the Japanese shogunate that was successfully ratified. The 1856 launch of the USS Merrimac \"USS Merrimack (1855)\"), one of six newly commissioned steam frigates, was one of Pierce's \"most personally satisfying\" days in office. [...] Pierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors. His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations, a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later, which mandated that most U.S. government positions be awarded on the basis of merit, not patronage. Secretary Robert McClelland \"Robert McClelland (American politician)\") reformed the Interior Department, systematizing its operations, expanding the use of paper records, and going after fraud. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand the role of the U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, an important step in the eventual development of the Justice Department. There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court—Fillmore, having failed to get Senate [...] Franklin Pierce was born on November 23, 1804, in a log cabin in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. He was a sixth-generation descendant of Thomas Pierce, who had moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from Norwich, Norfolk, England, in about 1634. His father Benjamin \"Benjamin Pierce (governor)\") was a lieutenant in the American Revolutionary War who moved from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, to Hillsborough after the war, purchasing 50 acres (20 ha) of land. Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife Anna Kendrick; his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth, leaving a daughter. Benjamin was a prominent Democratic-Republican state legislator, farmer, and tavern-keeper. During Pierce's childhood, his father was deeply involved in state politics, while two of"

      "snippet": "is troublesome. One problem with new technology is that the easier it is to copy, for example by photocopying or by computer, the stronger the perception of entitlement to copy becomes. Some copying is not prosecuted not because it's not actionable, but because copyright owners simply can't go after everybody out there. A lot of infringing activities typically go unchallenged, but that doesn't mean that these acts are legal or that the copier has any entitlement to do these things. What has happened, unfortunately, is that some of the activity that probably should be deemed infringing has started to be perceived by certain groups as an entitlement. They believe, for example, that a copyright owner is taking something away from them if that owner now has the ability to track usage. I [...] printed works or audio-visual or musical works, for example, will be done exclusively over the Internet? Will there be a total replacement of the so- called analog or traditional exploitation of works? What percentage will represent electronic distribution? MR. FICSOR: Early Views on the Impact of Digital Technology. If we speak about the threat side of this, we also should consider what kind of views [307] appeared in the first stage of discussions about the impact of digital technology, views suggesting that copyright was dead or that copyright would have one remaining duty, to die and be laid to rest six feet under. That was the first stage of discussions, and then there was a reaction to that, the argument that nothing should be changed, that everything could remain the same as it [...] but, in my view, until such time as technology does so, we may be faced with a very stark choice: a choice between a world without copyright protection and a world without the fair use and the other public domain advantages that currently exist. If we have to make that choice, then we will have to decide where are we better off. As we decide whether we are better off in a world without copyright, we will also have to consider - from the perspective of the infrastructure manufacturers and the hardware manufacturers - whether there is any point in manufacturing and developing an information superhighway on which there will be no cars.

      "snippet": "Pierce’s most significant challenge to his administration was the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. Drafted by Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas, it admitted the territories of Kansas and Nebraska under the terms of popular sovereignty—the citizens of each territory, rather than Congress, would determine whether slavery would be allowed. Instead of resolving the issue, this act sparked a rush of pro- and anti-slavery settlers into Kansas, leading to a series of violent conflicts. The resulting division caused the downfall of the Whig Party and the birth of the Republican Party, significantly altering the political landscape. The midterm congressional elections of 1854 and 1855 devastated the Democratic Party, underscoring the Act's profound impact. [...] Back in Concord, Pierce rejected the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1848 to continue his legal and political pursuits. The lands ceded by Mexico opened the slavery debate once again, dividing the United States politically. The nation nearly dissolved as Southern states threatened to secede if Congress prohibited slavery in the new territory. While Pierce usually sided with Southern states on the issue of slavery, he labored on behalf of the Compromise of 1850, which temporarily averted disaster. [...] When the Whig Party gained control of Congress in 1841, Pierce became dissatisfied with his position in the Senate minority. On February 28, 1842, Pierce resigned from the Senate, returned to New Hampshire and devoted more time to his law practice. He later served as Federal District Attorney for New Hampshire (1845-46). He actively participated in state political affairs and opposed the abolition movement because he felt it created national divisiveness. His policy towards slavery was not just a matter of political expediency, but a reflection of his strong belief in property rights over morality."

Therefore he aroused apprehension when he pressured Great Britain to relinquish its special interests along part of the Central American coast, and even more when he tried to persuade Spain to sell Cuba."
