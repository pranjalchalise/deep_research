      "title": "What Is Grace? by R.C. Sproul - Ligonier Ministries",
      "snippet": "Yet we can’t get the grace-gratitude dynamic right if we aren’t clear on what grace means. What is grace? The catechisms many of us learned as children give us the answer: “Grace is the unmerited favor of God.” The first thing that we understand about grace is what it’s not—it’s not something we merit. In fact, if that is all we ever understand about grace, I’m sure God will rejoice that we know His grace is unmerited. So, here’s our working definition of grace—it is unmerit. [...] That’s grace. Paul couldn’t say it any other way. To him who works, it’s debt; if you merit something, it means that someone is obligated to pay you. If I hire you as an employee and promise to pay you one hundred dollars if you work eight hours, I must pay you for working the eight hours. I’m not doing you a favor or giving you grace. You’ve earned your pay. You’ve fulfilled the contract, and I’m morally obliged to give you your wages. [...] With respect to the Lord, we are debtors who cannot pay. That’s why the Bible speaks of redemption in economic language—we were bought with a price (1 Cor. 6:20). Only someone else—Christ—can pay our debt. That’s grace. It’s not our good works that secure our rescue but only the works of Christ. It’s His merit, not ours. We don’t merit anything. He grants us His merit by grace, and we receive it only by faith. The essence of grace is its voluntary free bestowal. As soon as it’s a requirement, it’s no longer grace."

      "snippet": "ultimately disobedience to God and to Christ because they ordained the governing authorities. [...] when we recognize we’re submitting ultimately to Christ, because we know He’ll never tyrannize or abuse us. [...] To understand this, we have to understand the deeper problem that all of Scripture is dealing with—the problem of sin. At the most fundamental level, sin is an act of rebellion and disobedience to a higher law and Lawgiver. The biggest problem with the world is lawlessness. The reason people are violated, killed, and maimed in battle, the reason there are murders, robberies, and so forth is that we’re lawless. We disobey, first of all, the law of God. The root problem in all of creation is disobedience to law, defiance of authority. And the ultimate authority of the universe is God Himself."

      "snippet": "The law we are called to obey is a law that comes from Him. It is His law. It is a law that defines a relationship— the relationship between the Creator and the creature, between the sovereign and the vassal, between the King and His subjects. Not only is it His law in the sense that it comes from Him, but most significantly, it is a law that comes from and reflects His own character. It reveals and displays His righteousness, and therefore, it makes known what righteousness is. Notice that order. It is not that we first have a sense of righteousness and then we see that God conforms to it. Rather, first there is God in His perfect character, who is the standard of righteousness, and all righteousness is the revelation of who He is.How Does God\\'s Law Apply to Me?

      "snippet": "Bracing is very hard work, in terms of conceptualisation of the practical work to be done, and of the interaction with the whole team, starting from the physician-orthotist relationship, to the physiotherapist, the patient and the family. It is a demanding, progressive, slow, artisanal effort in the art of patience. In this respect, it is quite the opposite of the short, one-shot, quick, highly demanding, current surgical fusion. As we use to say to our patients, bracing corresponds to the very slow pace of building oneself that humans usually have to face, contrary to the fast solution that he/she may tend to prefer and see as less demanding. Bracing in this respect also becomes a philosophy of one's approach to life, and this is one reason why it is difficult that the slow pace of a [...] When the mould is ready, the plastic TLSO is fabricated, and the patient is fit according to his/her needs, allowing for good sitting position and total freedom of movement. The pushes are finally added at the level of the humps according to the desired corrections.\n\n### How to check the brace\n\nBrace checking is a fundamental step in any brace construction . This is especially true in braces following the SPoRT concept, since they are adjustable and customisable according to any individual curve pattern. The reaction of the body to predisposed project of the brace should also be considered during prescription and building. Brace checking is moreover a key psychological intervention on the patient and family, mainly, but not only, with the first brace. [...] Prescribing the SPoRT braces requires a careful three-dimensional evaluation of the characteristics of the curve of each single patient. Clinical reasoning follows a systematic path by looking progressively at the single component of the deformity.\n\n### Frontal plane correction\n\n#### The slopes\n\nCorrection on the frontal plane is based on the identification not of the curves (as usual), but of the slopes, that are the most frontally flexed segments of the spine. In fact, since the brace works by pushing the spine from below, and due to the presence of the drivers that avoid undesired actions, pushes are focussed on the most severely flexed area of the spine (slopes). In a down-up direction, the following slopes can be described:"
