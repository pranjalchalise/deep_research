We extend our sincere appreciation to Z. Hao, J. [...] T (TEM) cells decreased by 65% (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 15c,d), suggesting that RP@SMs promoted TCM cell accumulation in TDLNs, thereby enhancing antigen presentation and immune memory39.\"). The spleen, an essential immune organ with strong immunological memory functions, also showed significant activation40.\"),41.\"). Flow cytometry revealed higher proportions of CTLs and TEM cells in the spleens of RP@SMs-treated mice compared with the RPs and PBS groups (Supplementary Fig. 16). Similarly, in the tumour tissue, RP@SMs treatment significantly increased the proportions of CTLs and TEM cells (Fig. 4i,j and Supplementary Fig. 17). These findings collectively demonstrate that RP@SMs vaccination activated robust immune responses across TDLNs, spleen and tumour tissues, contributing to [...] ### Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis\n\nCellular and membrane proteins were extracted using a protein extraction kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) and analysed using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to standard protocols. Western blotting was performed following established procedures27.\"). Protein complexes were visualized using the ChemiDOC system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and quantified with Image Lab software (v. 4.0; Bio-Rad). Specific information about the antibodies used is detailed in Supplementary Table 2.\n\n### Plasmid transfection"

Within this context, digital hypertension has emerged as a multidisciplinary paradigm that integrates novel digital technologies into the prevention, diagnosis, and management of hypertension. Digital hypertension encompasses diverse domains such as advanced sensor development, continuous physiological monitoring, information processing, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, digital therapeutics, and telemedicine. These innovations enable more personalized, efficient, and data-driven hypertension care.
