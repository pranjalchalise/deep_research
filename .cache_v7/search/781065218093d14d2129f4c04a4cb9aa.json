      "snippet": "Below, we’ll go through five steps that illustrate how AI works: inputs, processing, outcomes, adjustments, and assessments.\n\n### Input\n\nData is first collected from various sources in the form of text, audio, video, and more. It is sorted into categories, such as those that can be read by the algorithms and those that cannot. You would then create the protocol and criteria for which data will be processed and used for specific outcomes.\n\n### Processing\n\nOnce data is gathered and inputted, the next step is to allow AI to decide what to do with the data. The AI sorts and deciphers the data using patterns it has been programmed to learn until it recognizes similar patterns in the data that is being filtered into the system.\n\n### Outcomes [...] AI is a complex technology with hundreds, if not thousands, of possibilities for creating solutions for businesses across industries. It enables machine learning algorithms that make our lives easier or better by doing things like automating tasks, powering virtual assistants, and generating transcripts of Zoom calls. With generative AI, we can create prompts to request content from processors like ChatGPT or Google Gemini.\n\n## How does AI work?\n\nIn order to create AI, you need to: define the problem, determine the outcomes, organize the data set, choose the appropriate technology, and then test solutions. If the intended solution does not work, you can continue experimenting to reach the desired outcome. [...] Machine learning: Machine learning is a subset of AI that incorporates computer science, mathematics, and coding. Machine learning focuses on developing algorithms that help machines learn from data and predict trends without human assistance.\n\n Deep learning: Deep learning is a discipline of AI that imitates the human brain by learning from how it structures and processes information to make decisions. This subset of machine learning can learn from unstructured data without supervision, instead of being programmed to perform a specific task.\n\n Neural networks: A neural network is a deep learning technique designed to resemble the human brain’s structure. Neural networks perform calculations and create outputs on large data sets."

      "snippet": "## How Does AI Learn?\n\nAt the core of most AI systems is machine learning, which allows programs to improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Here’s how it works:\n\n Massive Data Sets feed the system—everything from medical images to customer purchase histories.\n Intelligent Algorithms crunch that data repeatedly, learning which inputs lead to the best outcomes.\n Feedback Loops constantly refine the model’s accuracy, helping it “learn” from its mistakes and improve with each pass.\n\nThis process allows AI to develop insights, make predictions, and take actions based on data, all without needing step-by-step human instruction.\n\n## What is Generative AI? [...] If you’re still getting familiar with the basics of artificial intelligence, here’s a quick overview — then we’ll show you how CSU Global can help you take the next step.\n\n## What Is Artificial Intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence is a set of technologies that allow machines and computer programs to mimic human intelligence. AI systems learn from experience, identify patterns, and make decisions based on large volumes of data, often at a speed and scale far beyond what people can achieve alone.\n\nAI isn’t a single tool. It’s a collection of algorithms, models, and systems used to solve complex problems, automate tasks, and support better decision-making.\n\n## How Does AI Learn? [...] Deep Learning – A specific type of machine learning that allows AI to learn and improve by processing data. Deep Learning uses artificial neural networks which mimic biological neural networks in the human brain to process information, find connections between the data, and come up with inferences, or results based on positive and negative reinforcement.\n Neural Networks – A process that analyzes data sets over and over again to find associations and interpret meaning from undefined data. Neural Networks operate like networks of neurons in the human brain, allowing AI systems to take in large data sets, uncover patterns amongst the data, and answer questions about it."

      "snippet": "## How does AI work?\n\nArtificial intelligence techniques, though diverse, all fundamentally rely on data, algorithms, and computational power. AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans might miss. This data serves as the training material, the quality and quantity of which are crucial for the AI's performance.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, AI isn't a single technology but a broad field encompassing several key areas: [...] What it is: AI is a field of computer science focused on creating smart machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, like learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.\n How it works: AI systems learn from vast amounts of data, identifying patterns to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. Think of it as teaching a computer by showing it a million examples instead of writing a million rules.\n Where you see it: You're using AI every day in navigation apps like Google Maps, personalized recommendations on shopping sites, spam filters in your email, and virtual assistants like Gemini Live. [...] AI is about teaching computers to do the amazing things our own brains can do, from understanding the world around them to learning new things and even coming up with fresh ideas. For instance, AI is used in optical character recognition (OCR) to pull text and data from various images and documents. This process transforms unstructured content into structured, business-ready data, helping uncover valuable insights.\n\n## How does AI work?"

      "snippet": "## How do AI algorithms work?\n\nWhile a general algorithm can be simple, AI algorithms are by nature more complex. AI algorithms work by taking in training data that helps the algorithm to learn. How that data is acquired and is labeled marks the key difference between different types of AI algorithms.\n\nAt the core level, an AI algorithm takes in training data (labeled or unlabeled, supplied by developers, or acquired by the program itself) and uses that information to learn and grow. Then it completes its tasks, using the training data as a basis. Some types of AI algorithms can be taught to learn on their own and take in new data to change and refine their process. Others will need the intervention of a programmer in order to streamline.\n\n## Types of artificial intelligence algorithms [...] #### Random Forest\n\nThe random forest algorithm is actually a broad collection of different decision trees, leading to its name. The random forest builds different decision trees and connects them to gain more accurate results. These can be used for both classification and regression.\n\n#### Support Vector Machines\n\nThe support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is another common AI algorithm that can be used for either classification or regression (but is most often used for classification). SVM works by plotting each piece of data on a chart (in N dimensional space where N = the number of datapoints). Then, the algorithm classifies the datapoints by finding the hyperplace that separates each class. There can be more than one hyperplane.\n\n#### Naive Bayes [...] ## What is an AI algorithm?\n\nSo then what is an AI algorithm? The definition of an algorithm is “a set of instructions to be followed in calculations or other operations.” This applies to both mathematics and computer science. So, at the essential level, an AI algorithm is the programming that tells the computer how to learn to operate on its own.\n\nAn AI algorithm is much more complex than what most people learn about in algebra, of course. A complex set of rules drive AI programs, determining their steps and their ability to learn. Without an algorithm, AI wouldn’t exist.\n\n## How do AI algorithms work?"

      "snippet": "Artificial neural networks are mathematical models that enable deep learning. At their core, they are an imitation of the human brain. Made up of layers of interconnected nodes – called artificial neurons or perceptrons – each artificial neuron takes in inputs, performs calculations and generates an output. These outputs are then passed on to the next layer of perceptrons, creating a hierarchical structure.\n\nThe power of neural networks lies in their ability to learn and recognize patterns in data. Intrigued about neural networks and how they are being used today? Read more in our article “What are neural networks?”.\n\nWhat is an AI management system? [...] What is an AI management system?\n\nAn AI management system is like the brains behind how an organization handles its AI projects. It’s all about setting up rules and methods to make sure AI is used responsibly and effectively. This system helps manage everything from assessing risks to putting AI into action in a responsible way.\n\nThink of it as a roadmap for using AI wisely as the technology evolves. An AI management framework sets out a structured way for managing the risks and opportunities associated with AI. It covers key components such as transparency, explainability and autonomy, giving organizations clear directions on how to use AI in line with evolving regulations (e.g. EU AI Act). [...] Building a responsible artificial intelligence\n\nWith an ability to synthesize, analyse and act on enormous amounts of data in seconds, artificial intelligence is extremely powerful. As with any powerful technology, it is crucial we implement it responsibly to maximize on its potential while minimizing negative impacts.\n\nFor example, if trained using unscrutinized data, AI can replicate harmful biases about race, religion, upbringing or other human characteristics. This could be potentially disastrous if embedded in artificial intelligence used in health, recruitment, law or other human-centred applications."
