      "snippet": "As a leader in open‑source agent development, LangChain’s bread and butter is building, orchestrating, and deploying agents seamlessly for developers and non‑technical users alike. To advance this mission, Brace Sproul, Head of Applied AI, and his team built a cloud‑hosted coding agent that runs autonomously end to end. To open-source it reliably, they needed to nail one thing: their sandbox partner. [...] And the team doesn’t stop at attentive support. They continuously evolve the platform based on LangChain’s feedback. By actively seeking input and implementing improvements quickly, Daytona keeps LangChain focused on their core projects and pushes them further ahead in the fast-moving AI space.\n\n#### The fact that Daytona is always so engaged and responsive is one of the main reasons why we chose them. Working with them has been seamless.\n\nBrace Sproul\n\nHead of Applied AI at LangChain\n\n###### 03 -- RESULT\n\n### LangChain Spins Up 4000 Sandboxes Every Month with Daytona [...] langchain.com\n\nlangchain.com\n\nLinkedin\n\nLinkedin\n\nLinkedin\n\nLearn how the leading open-source agent engineering platform partnered with Daytona to ensure secure, instant, and persistent sandboxes for their production-ready coding agent.\n\n#### Our mission is to be the one place developers go for all their agent needs.

      "snippet": "During the \"Ambient Agents\" meetup last week, Brace Sproul gave us a walkthrough of Open SWE, a coding agent built on Langgraph. Open SWE monitors GitHub issues. When it gets a new one assigned, it kicks off a multi-agent architecture with a Manager, Planner, and Programmer. It can receive messages from users at any time during the process and incorporate them into the state. Check out the slides for diagrams explaining each agent:  And the code:  I found the takeaways really interesting: \\ Summarization is hard: Especially with code changes that can get quite long, you literally can't send the entire context history to the LLM, and highly detailed old diffs may distract it. IIRC, the agent sends the last 20 messages, and summarizes the changes before. \\ Agentic > hard coded: Open SWE [...] # \"Open SWE: A coding agent built on Langgraph, explained by Brace Sproul\"\n\nThis title was summarized by AI from the post below.\n\nPamela Fox\n\nI like to learn, teach, and create.\n\n Report this post [...] the changes before. \\ Agentic > hard coded: Open SWE tends to use the agentic approach of \"here are your tools, pick which one to use\" for almost all tasks. Except for one.. \\ Explicit error handling: When an error happens, Open SWE stops everything and focuses on resolving the error. Otherwise, it could get too far afield and be unable to get back to a good place to solve the error. (Hopefully I didn't mis-represent anything I heard!) #Langchain #Langgraph"

He doth it in the preaching of the word, as if he were present with you, stood amongst you, and spake personally to every one of you….

      "snippet": "poor timing of the Regents’ decisions would be a recurring event throughout the controversy, and Edelstein would later curse their delay with decision making as a ‘devilish trick’.34 However, Sproul did not realise the importance of this first misjudged timing, nor did he even consider the harmfulness of the oath itself. David Gardner contends that Sproul thought that the oath would solve several issues, and did not contemplate that it would actually cause much greater difficulties.35 This was a tactical decision aimed at confirming public confidence in the university during a period of insecurity about communism, and alleviating internal tensions.36 It was also supposed that the oath would help prevent outside interference into the university’s business. As David Caute depicts it, it was [...] (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003), 30. 28 Robert Gordon Sproul (1891-1975) was the eleventh President of the University of California, and held this position for twenty eight years: W.

It was in this meeting that the loyalty oath was first proposed. It was physically produced by the university’s comptroller James Corley, before being presented by the university’s President,27 Robert Gordon Sproul.28 The Regents were receptive towards the oath,29 and it was passed unanimously.30 The timing of these events was significant – the oath was not proposed while the press were present, only Sproul, the Regents, and the Secretary of the Regents were in the room at the time.31 The faculty did not hear anything about the decisions made at this meeting until a notice appeared in the"
