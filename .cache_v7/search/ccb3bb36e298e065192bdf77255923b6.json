Then, we instruct the model to expand these extracted cultural contexts to provide additional information.\nThis includes expanding transliterated words or phrases mentioned in the user prompt for better understanding.

The streets are narrow and lined with small shops boasting an assortment of vi-brant goods - textiles, local handicrafts, and perhaps a dhaba serving up steaming momos. Cultural accu-racy is attended to with signboards in both Hindi and English, and the occasional sight of local attire like the Himachali cap. The sun plays mischievously with the scene, casting a warm glow and creating a bustling atmosphere.\" • Context: \"Scene 1: Preeti, with a sparkle of adven-ture in her eyes, is leading her group of friends confidently through the bustling market streets of Dalhousie, amidst the vibrant chaos of shop displays, street food, and local chatter.\" • Characters: – [...] profiles and generated scene details from the previous steps along with instructions on how to craft the T2I prompts. The instructions ensure that the model captures actions in scenes, spatial relationship between characters, replace local words with their visual descriptions, replace character names with their demographic identifiers etc. while generating the T2I prompts."

First, we implemented a deduplication process to remove redundant content, which was essential due to the extensive nature of our data collection. To address the challenge of multilingual content often found on news websites, we removed or translated the languages other than Nepali depending upon the context. We also devel-oped specialized scripts to remove noise, eliminat-ing non-textual elements such as HTML tags, spe-cial characters, and formatting artifacts common in web-scraped data.
