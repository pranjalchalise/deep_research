      "snippet": "Outside his role as the acting CEO of Pax, Marius is a skilled painter. He graduated with honors from the Florence College of Art, a time he describes as special and extremely happy,, and he has returned to Stellis for post-graduate studies in art and art history in addition to his duties at Pax. He credits Van Kerrel with beginning his interest in art, having attended an auction he ran at age five.\n\nTo distinguish Marius from his brother, directors and veteran Pax employees refer to him as \"Mr. Marius,\" while outsiders tend to buy into his rich brat persona and call him \"Master Marius\" or, more respectfully, \"Mr. von Hagen.\"\n\n### Childhood[edit | edit source] [...] It is difficult to understand this second young master. The inconvenient demands Marius must deal with every day are unimaginable. The public and secret battles against the top executives of the family conglomerate is not for the faint hearted. Moreover, he dislikes hypocritical social rules and refuses to give face to those who flatter and fawn. Perhaps instead of inheriting the family business, he would rather be free and unconstrained in creating art. Marius has completed an undergraduate course majoring in oil painting at the reputable Florence College of Art and is presently studying in the art department of Stellis University. One may think this kind of young master is ignorant and incompetent, but Marius' paintings are absolutely amazing. If one has the chance, it is highly [...] Marius attended Starhigh High School, Stellis' most prestigious private school, but he only stayed for a year. His status as a von Hagen made him the target of significant unwanted attention, and when false rumors of a feud between him and his brother made the situation worse and affected Giann's recent position at Pax, Marius left the country at age 16 to attend high school abroad instead to protect his family, claiming it would help him get used to foreign cultures before his enrollment at the Florence College of Art. The move required him to start over since his previous credits weren't accepted, but he attained all necessary credits to graduate in only two years.\n\n## Personality and Interests[edit | edit source]"

      "snippet": "[edit]\n\nMarius meets Courfeyrac, a fellow student, who introduces him to a society called the Friends of the ABC, a political group committed to republican revolution. Almost immediately, Marius' Bonapartist beliefs come into conflict with the republican views of the group's members. Marius nevertheless remains on good terms with them—especially Courfeyrac, with whom he lives for a time. \"In a few days,\" Hugo writes, \"Marius was the friend of Courfeyrac... Marius, in Courfeyrac's presence, breathed freely, a new thing for him.\" Marius descends further into poverty and, despite all his hardships, manages to complete his studies and become a recognized lawyer. On Courfeyrac's advice, he learns German and English in order to work for a publisher translating manuscripts into French. [...] Marius Pontmercy (French pronunciation: (/wiki/Help:IPA/French \"Help:IPA/French\")) is a fictional character, one of the protagonists of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Misérables. He is a young student, and the suitor of Cosette. Believing Cosette lost to him, and determined to die, he joins the revolutionary association Friends of the ABC, which he associates with, but is not a part of, as they take part in the 1832 June Rebellion. Facing death in the fight, his life is saved by Jean Valjean, and he subsequently weds Cosette, a young woman whom Valjean had raised as his own.\n\n## In the novel\n\n[edit]\n\n### Marius and his father\n\n[edit] [...] In the novel, Marius' closest friend among the students is Courfeyrac. In the musical, he appears to be closer to Enjolras, though he participates in friendly interactions with others.\n Marius' political opinions play a larger role in the novel, where he is a Bonapartist, which is a point of conflict between him and the Friends of the ABC.\n Marius' romance with Cosette progresses more rapidly, and it appears that he first sees Cosette, meets her, and prepares to leave for the barricade in the space of one day. In the novel, his feelings for Cosette develop more gradually, and he is separated from her for about six months before he finds her again.\n Marius' lodging at the Gorbeau House is not mentioned in the musical, and the scene in which he spies on the Jondrettes is omitted."

      "snippet": "However, scholars have pointed out that Marius's supposed \"humiliation\" cannot have been too long-lasting. In c. 98–97 BC, he was given the unprecedented honour of being elected in absentia to the college of priestly augurs whilst away in Asia Minor. Furthermore, Marius's mere presence at the trial of Manius Aquillius in 98 BC, his friend and former colleague as consul in 101 BC, was enough to secure acquittal for the accused, even though he was apparently guilty. Marius also successfully acted as sole defence for T. Matrinius in 95 BC, an Italian from Spoletium who had been granted Roman citizenship by Marius and who was now being prosecuted under a new citizenship law.\n\n### Social War\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Social War (91–87 BC) \"Social War (91–87 BC)\") [...] [edit]\n\nMain article: Marian reforms\n\nMarius has, in modern scholarship starting from the 1840s in Germany, repeatedly been attributed with broad reforms to the military during his consulships between 107 and 100 BC. The standard narrative is that after a series of manpower shortages, Marius received a dispensation to recruit volunteers from the poorest census class, the proletarii, for the war against Jugurtha in 107 BC.-77) There is, however, very little evidence that Italy's population fell during the second century, that any major reforms to the Roman army occurred in the second century, or that Marius was responsible; specialists now increasingly dismiss these \"Marian reforms\" as a \"construct of modern scholarship\". [...] The Cimbri, after their decisive victory at Arausio, marched west into Hispania. Marius was tasked with rebuilding, effectively from scratch, the Gallic legions. Building his army around a core of trained legionaries from the last year, Marius again secured exemption from the property requirements and with his newly minted reputation for victory, raised an army of some thirty thousand Romans and forty thousand Italian allies and auxiliaries. He established a base around the town of Aquae Sextiae (modern Aix-en-Provence) and trained his men."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer.

Hauknes is a historian of medieval art whose research focuses on the intersections of art, science, and myth. His first book, Art, Knowledge, and Papal Politics in Medieval Rome (Cambridge University Press, 2025), presents the first comprehensive study of the thirteenth-century fresco cycle in the Aula Gotica (“Gothic Hall”) of Santi Quattro Coronati in Rome, one of the most significant monuments of medieval Italian painting. The book argues that the Aula Gotica functioned as a large-scale encyclopedia—an immersive environment designed to stimulate intellectual inquiry and philosophical reflection. By reassessing Rome’s artistic culture in the mid-thirteenth century, it counters the assumption that the city lagged behind other centers, instead showing it to be a site of [...] University of Notre Dame\n\nDepartment of Art, Art History, and Design\n\nCollege of Arts and Letters\n\n Home\n Menu\n\n1.
