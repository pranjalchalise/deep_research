Unlike traditional reconstruction methods that depend heavily on manual interpretation of drawings or fragmented measurements13.\"), AIGC allows the rapid generation of multiple stylistic variants informed by historical semantics, decorative patterns, and spatial contexts.

Among the mainstream platforms, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL·E 3 represent three distinct paradigms, each based on different algorithmic frameworks and user interaction modes, thereby supporting varying levels of semantic control and visual expressiveness (see Table 4)."

Florentin Koch from École Polytechnique and HEC Paris, alongside colleagues, introduce ‘Recursivism’ , a novel conceptual paradigm to analyse art capable of self-transformation. This paper formalises recursion, a principle well-established in mathematics and computer science, as an aesthetic lens through which to view art that doesn’t just change its outputs, but actively modifies its own generative processes. By establishing a five-level analytical scale and three operational criteria , state memory, rule evolvability, and reflexive visibility , Koch et al. provide a crucial tool for distinguishing"

      "snippet": "A recent study published by researchers at UC Berkeley Haas and Cornell University found that the output of scientists using generative AI to aid in research increases by as much as 50%, but the work they are publishing is of “marginal scientific merit.” It also found that humans are still producing better research on their own: papers written by people improved the more complex the writing got, while papers written by LLMs got worse when the complexity increased. [...] That all sounds lovely in theory, but it may not be all roses and scientific breakthroughs in practice. Since generative AI tools like ChatGPT have become available to the public, scientific journals have been flooded with papers of dubious quality thanks to researchers farming out parts of the work to AI. An eye-catching example of this happened when the journal Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology published a paper that included an AI-generated image of a rat with an extremely large penis and too many testicles. Scientific publishing was already facing a crunch of too many papers and not enough time for thorough review, and that has only gotten worse with the availability of AI to handle the boring stuff—whether it actually does it correctly being an entirely different matter.

WeRide GENESIS bridges physical AI and generative AI, connecting the real and simulated worlds to accelerate the development, training, and validation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) at scale. [...] Leveraging generative AI, WeRide GENESIS can rapidly generate highly realistic virtual worlds,  building simulated cities within minutes and accurately reproducing rare, extreme real-world driving scenarios that are difficult to capture on actual roads. This enables AVs to undergo large-scale training and validation in simulation. Insights generated are continuously fed back into real-world operations – significantly enhancing AV performance in complex scenarios, speeding up iteration cycles, and reducing time and cost compared to traditional road testing."
