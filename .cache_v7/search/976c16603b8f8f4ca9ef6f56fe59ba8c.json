This process combines web design, development, blogging, search engine optimization, pay-per-click marketing, reputation management, directory listings, social media, link sharing, and other avenues to create a long-term positive presence for a person, organization, or product in search engines and on the web in general.\n\nOnline presence management is distinct from web presence management in that the former is generally a marketing and messaging discipline while the latter is Governance, risk management, and compliance operational and security discipline.\n\n## Theory\n\n[edit] [...] Internet advertising is a form of broadcasting and promotion of products, ideas, or services using the internet to attract customers.

Internet advertising targets users interested in relevant keywords and displays a text or image ad next to search results or within social media. While searching to these specific keywords, firms can target their advertisements for specific audiences.

      "snippet": "Not because I’m becoming an influencer or launching a business, but because I want my online “home” to be a place I enjoy existing and playing in on my terms. I want to hand over my handle with confidence, knowing when a new potential friend or contact glances at my profile, they’ll have a basic understanding of who I am and what I love.\n\nI reached out to my peers, career coaches, and recruitment experts to learn more about building an online presence that works for you instead of against you. Here’s what I’ve learned.\n\n## First, do you need an online presence?\n\nYou don’t need an online presence to be valued socially or professionally if it doesn’t align with your goals. You, as a person, remain as brilliant and delightful whether you have an Instagram or not. [...] If you often find yourself stopping important life events or ignoring momentous occasions in favor of posting to “the ‘gram,” it might be worth examining. Are you sharing things you genuinely enjoy and believe others will too, or are you posting solely for the algorithm to do its magic work and make you look wealthier, or smarter, or sexier? (It’s okay, we’ve all done it).\n\nOur online presence is not an extension of our personality—rather, it’s a vehicle. That means we aren’t who we claim to be online but how we claim to be it. If you’re posting only what you want others to think about you, even though it’s not true, your online persona is simply a product of others’ expectations.\n\n“We aren’t who we claim to be online but how we claim to be it.“ [...] “I also always make it a point to remind folks that their online presence can be as buttoned up or as vulnerable as they’re comfortable with,” says Cadet, “but it does have to be authentic to who they are.” That’s because who we are is completely unrelated to how many followers we have, or how much of our lives we choose to share.\n\nInstead of looking at the numbers, consider who you want to speak to and why. What next actions do you want friends, followers, or subscribers to take after they come across your online self? Do you want them to be inspired by you? To hire you? To challenge you? Or to feel empowered, or joyful?\n\nPerhaps you don’t want them to take any action at all and just prefer to keep your online presence as a one-way portfolio showcase. That’s okay!"
