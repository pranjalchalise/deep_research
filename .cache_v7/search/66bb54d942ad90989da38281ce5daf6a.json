      "snippet": "Dr. Ha Thanh Dong is a dynamic researcher in the field of aquatic animal health, internationally recognized for his contributions to infectious and emerging infectious diseases in tropical aquaculture, disease diagnostics, host-pathogen interactions, and vaccine development. He has played a key role in identifying and developing diagnostic methods for numerous infectious pathogens affecting aquaculture species, including tilapia, Asian sea bass, catfish, snake skin gourami, Siamese fighting fish, and whiteleg shrimp. Dong's research extends to fish immunology and vaccine development, and other new disease-control strategies, offering sustainable alternatives to antibiotics. Recent studies from his team have unveiled unprecedented applications of nanobubble technologies in enhancing the [...] Dong has authored or co-authored over 110 international peer-reviewed articles in this field and currently serves as an advisory board member and/or guest editor for several reputable journals in this field. In 2023, he was listed as one of the world's top 2% most-cited scientists in the field of Fisheries by Stanford University. Additionally, he has served as an expert and/or consultant for several projects led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the WorldFish Center. He is primarily affiliated with the Asian Institute of Technology and has recently been appointed to the honorary title and position of Adjunct Professor at James Cook University, Singapore.   \n  \n Back to home"

      "snippet": "New blue iridium complexes with a trimethylsilyl group as a bulky electron donating group, Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) and Ir(F2-m-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp), were synthesized via μ-chloro-bridged dimer and perfluoropropylated triazole-based ancillary ligands and then characterized using various spectroscopic studies. Both Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) and Ir(F2-m-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) exhibited high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of 75 ± 5% and 76 ± 5% in films, respectively. The DFT calculation demonstrated that the new blue iridium complexes have a wide bandgap compared with FIrpic and the Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) with a trimethylsilyl group in the para position has a slightly deeper HOMO level than that of the Ir(F2-p-trimethylsilyl)2(fptp) with a trimethylsilyl group [...] regularly utilized to update and shape the computational search. Supervised machine learning methods prioritized candidate structures prior to quantum chemistry simulation to prevent wasting compute on likely poor performers. With this combination of techniques, each multiplying the strength of the search, this effort managed to navigate an area of molecular space and identify hundreds of promising OLED candidate structures. An experimentally validated selection of this set shows emitters with external quantum efficiencies as high as 22%. [...] electron microscopy and electron diffraction enable direct visualization of the structural relationship between donor and acceptor (D-A) chromophores within the MOF. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that the structural and symmetry features of the MOF reduce the donor-to-acceptor singlet transfer efficiency to less than 36% compared to around 96% in the control sample, where the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor chromophores cannot be controlled."
