      "snippet": "The character of John Smith presented literary critics with an interesting figure that seemed to suggest that the author Jo hn Smith’s style and content were influenced by several different European sources. In American Literature in the Colonial and National Periods , Sears places the origins of the character John Smith in the tales of the knight-errant. The knight errant is a wandering figure out in search of adventure, who often quests in the name of a lady (10). While this does seem to influence Smith, it is certainly not his only influence. Smith’s works also contain many similarities to the Spanish [...] On the other hand, the character of John Smith does not just take on one role. While Smith is a colonial leader, he is a picaro-like opportunist. In the scene immediately following the building of Jamestown, Smith takes advantage of the surrender of a group of natives: “And then they brought him Venison, Turkies, wild foule, bread, and what they had” (315). By recognizing the opportunity to manipulate the terms of the natives’ \n\nsurrender, Smith secures food that the starving Englishmen desperately need. By borrowing from both the picaresque and the tale of the knight-errant, Smith adapts and appropriates a Spanish form of literature in his account of the New World. Not only do his works reflect a Spanish literary influence, but they also reflect French and other 15 [...] European influences. Smith is not a provincial writer, but a more sophisticated, \n\ncosmopolitan writer whose works become a veritable “melting pot” of literary influences."

      "snippet": "After returning to England due to injuries, Smith shifted his focus to writing, producing several influential works that chronicled his experiences and promoted colonization in North America. While some of his accounts are considered exaggerated, they remain vital historical sources that document early Virginia and the interactions with Native Americans. Smith continued to advocate for colonization efforts until his death in 1631, leaving a complex legacy as both a leader and a promoter of English expansion in the New World.\n\nPublished in: 2023\n\nBy: Gragg, Larry\n\nGo to EBSCOhost and sign in to access more content about this topic.\n\n## John Smith\n\nExplorer [...] Smith’s work, moreover, had significance in his own era. A Description of New England: Or, Observations and Discoveries of Captain John Smith (1616), New Englands Trials (1620), and The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles served as promotional literature for expanding the English empire. He wrote in glowing terms of the prospects for North America. Yet, to build flourishing colonies, England would have to learn from his experiences in Virginia and New England. Success would come, Smith argued, only from a combination of firm leadership, industrious settlers, and aid from the English crown. [...] In the last half of his life, Smith became less a man of action and more a writer and advocate of further colonization. In all, he published ten works. These autobiographical sketches, histories, reprints of other accounts, guides for seamen, and promotional tracts constitute the most important source of information on Smith’s life. For generations, historians dismissed them as unreliable because Smith’s portrayal of his career was so fantastic. He did include episodes that stretch the limits of credibility. For example, he tended to attribute his escapes from difficult circumstances to the intervention of women. When the Turks captured him, Smith explained, they sold him as a household slave to a young woman named Charatza Tragabigzanda. She quickly became attracted to the Englishman and"

According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith's credibility is the fact that \"no one in Smith's day ever expressed doubt\" about the story's veracity, and many people who would have known the truth \"were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen\", including Pocahontas herself.\n\nSmith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World.
