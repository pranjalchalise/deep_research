      "snippet": "Contents\n\n## My long term career plans\n\nAt the heart of it, I want to be able to do a job that I enjoy, working for causes that I feel passionate about. This doesn’t sound very unusual, I’d hope most people set out to do fulfilling work that they enjoy. Sadly in my experience many people get sidetracked by money or feel unable to make bold career moves.\n\nAbsolutely central to having so much freedom is to have a savings safety net. Over the past few years I’ve gradually built up my savings and lowered my expenses (2019 report here). [...] ## Where could I work?\n\nAcademia – there are no shortage of research groups working on things I care about. In the short term doing a postdoc somewhere could be a handy way to see another part of the world and build my skills while contributing to the field.\n\nBusiness – I feel like I could have very fulfilling careers working in a huge range of companies, ranging from eco-web search company Ecosia, ethical banking company Triodos through to fighting sexual exploitation with Thorn.\n\nSocial enterprise / Charity – Corals for Conservation (group I helped in Fiji), Migrateful, 38 Degrees or a whole host of other charities and social enterprises could make for interesting work.\n\n### How about starting my own company? [...] It would be great to be able to continue spending time helping students on this website, whilst at the same time picking up a few other projects which can help in other fields.\n\n### What I care about\n\nI care about two main things: people and the planet. I don’t know exactly what I’ll be doing in 10 years time, but I know that I’m passionate about these two main causes and want to play my part in making the world a better place. That sounds very non-committal, but this means that I have some scope to try out a huge range of different fields.\n\n### Potential fields of work\n\nFields on my radar which I’ve been considering going into include:\n\nA pretty diverse list! They’re all tied together by the central idea of trying to help make the world a better place.\n\n### How could I help?"

And while I went deep down the path toward obtaining a faculty position (even getting an onsite interview back in Spring 2018), in the back of my mind I had doubts about being a faculty member; that path just didn’t feel right.

      "snippet": "# Post-PhD career plans - interview question\n\nI have an upcoming interview for a PhD post in the UK. First time applying and first postgraduate interview so I’m not sure how this PhD interview stuff goes, It’s for a grant-funded post in the life sciences with a project already established. Computational anatomy stuff\n\nOne of the things I’m concerned about is discussing my plans for the future and how this post fits in with my future goals. They also want me to talk about “how you'll take this particular work and yourself forward”. However I do not have any plans at the moment. Ideally, I would like to become an academic, but that’s extremely intimidating, I’m not convinced it will be a great fit for me and I’m also very open to options outside of academia. [...] Both PIs are hardcore researchers in academia and very well established in their field, I have a feeling they won’t be impressed to take on a student that 1, isn’t planning a career committed to this line of research, and 2, doesn’t know if academia is ‘for them’\n\nHow would you guys suggest I approach this discussion at the interview?\n\nany other advice about the best way to prepare would be totally fantastic - any/all advice is very welcome!!\n\n# Related Answers Section\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts"

(Toxic Frustrating Academia where no one cares about you or Industry where no one cares about you at all?).\n\nWhen I started my PhD I was enthusiastic about everything and always thought that I didn't need money because I love scientific research. Seems like the real world out there is ruthless. I know this is a wrong question but has anyone ever become a millionaire after their Ph.D. ?
