This modular approach breaks down complex language-based AI systems into reusable parts. When a user submits a query, LangChain can process this input through a series of steps.\n\nFor example, a typical workflow might involve: [...] # What is LangChain?\n\nLangChain is an open-source orchestration framework that simplifies building applications with large language models (LLMs).

      "snippet": "LangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\n### Importing language models [...] My IBM\n\nLog in\n\nSubscribe\n\n# What is LangChain?\n\n## Authors\n\nDave Bergmann\n\nSenior Staff Writer, AI Models\n\nIBM Think\n\nCole Stryker\n\nStaff Editor, AI Models\n\nIBM Think\n\n## LangChain overview\n\nLangChain is an open source orchestration framework for application development using large language models (LLMs). Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and AI agents. [...] LangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response."

      "snippet": "1. By mutability:\n\n Static context: Immutable data that doesn’t change during execution (e.g., user metadata, database connections, tools)\n Dynamic context: Mutable data that evolves as the application runs (e.g., conversation history, intermediate results, tool call observations)\n\n1. By lifetime:\n\n Runtime context: Data scoped to a single run or invocation\n Cross-conversation context: Data that persists across multiple conversations or sessions\n\nRuntime context refers to local context: data and dependencies your code needs to run. It does not refer to:\n\n The LLM context, which is the data passed into the LLM’s prompt.\n The “context window”, which is the maximum number of tokens that can be passed to the LLM. [...] | Context type | Description | Mutability | Lifetime | Access method |\n ---  --- \n| Static runtime context | User metadata, tools, db connections passed at startup | Static | Single run | `context` argument to `invoke`/`stream` |\n| Dynamic runtime context (state) | Mutable data that evolves during a single run | Dynamic | Single run | LangGraph state object |\n| Dynamic cross-conversation context (store) | Persistent data shared across conversations | Dynamic | Cross-conversation | LangGraph store |\n\n## ​ Static runtime context\n\nStatic runtime context represents immutable data like user metadata, tools, and database connections that are passed to an application at the start of a run via the `context` argument to `invoke`/`stream`. This data does not change during execution.\n\nCopy [...] Runtime context is a form of dependency injection and can be used to optimize the LLM context. It lets to provide dependencies (like database connections, user IDs, or API clients) to your tools and nodes at runtime rather than hardcoding them. For example, you can use user metadata in the runtime context to fetch user preferences and feed them into the context window.\n\nLangGraph provides three ways to manage context, which combines the mutability and lifetime dimensions:"

      "snippet": "A quick note on truncation: this is the process of taking the message history and continually narrowing it down in order to stay within the language models context window. There’s lots of different ways of doing it, and in fact ChatGPT has a custom approach, but there is no silver bullet here since you will always end up having to omit important info you care about. This is why Embeddings and memory through langchain can be so useful.\n\n### Comparison tools 🔍 [...] Langchain makes creating agents using large language models simple through their agents API. Developers can use OpenAI functions or other means of executing tasks to enable to language model to take actions. [...] ### Why does langchain exist? 🤔\n\nSimply put, there are many rough edges to working with languages models today. The entire ecosystem is still developing so for developers, there is generally a lack of sufficient tooling to make production deployments of languages models.\n\nTasks like prompt chaining, logging, call backs, persistent memory, and efficient connections to multiple data sources come standard out of the box with langchain.\n\nLangchain also provides a model agnostic toolset that enables companies and developers to explore multiple LLM offerings and test what works best for their use cases. The best part is that you can do this in a single interface instead of having to linearly scale the size of a code base which each additional provider you try to support."
