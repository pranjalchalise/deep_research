      "snippet": "As a fast-moving start up, Dandy was impressed by the pace of innovation set by Chronosphere. Pierce says that every couple of weeks brings a new improvement to the solution. \"One week it was a new menu bar, the next it was a new trace explorer. I'm always excited before our weekly syncs because I want to know what kind of enhancements are coming our way,\" he says. [...] For example, a dentist was having difficulty because the patient name mistakenly contained a forward slash. The Dandy team reached out to the dentist, sanitized the name, and enabled them to continue scanning. \"What used to be a help desk ticket was instead seamlessly resolved within minutes,\" says Pierce.\n\n# Fit for the future\n\nPierce also reserves praise for the Chronosphere Customer Success team. When they started, Chronosphere set up dedicated interactive sessions where Dandy engineers could learn more about the platform. They also studied the company's observability objectives and engineering goals to push us toward Dandy's performance targets. [...] \"Google Cloud offers a tool for everything we need. Instead of going through lengthy, costly onboarding processes for another SaaS solution, we just go through Google, or spin up the open-source dependency in one of our GKE clusters,\" says Pierce.\n\n# Drilling into detail\n\nAlongside Google Cloud Logging, which records specific system events, Dandy needed a dedicated observability solution to monitor tracing and metrics and further improve the quality and reliability of its software service.\n\nChoosing Chronosphere, a Google Cloud partner, was a clear decision. \"Chronosphere is built from the ground up to work with Google Cloud. We can get all our Google-native metrics into Chronosphere, and engineers no longer need to jump back and forth between tools.\""

      "snippet": "# Build a modern, unified analytics data platform with Google Cloud\n\nLearn about necessary decision points in creating a modern, unified analytics data platform built on Google Cloud.\n\nAuthors: Firat Tekiner and Susan Pierce\n\nGet started for free\n\nLearn about BigQuery\n\nSet up your own BigQuery sandbox and analyze data without a credit card\n\n## Overview [...] This requires convergence in both the technology and the approach to understanding and discovering the value in your data.\n\n## Treat data warehouse storage like a data lake\n\nYou can build a data warehouse or a data lake separately on Google Cloud, but you don’t have to pick one or the other. In many cases, the underlying products that our customers use are the same for both, and the only difference between their data lake and data warehouse implementation is the data access policy that is employed. In fact, the two terms are starting to converge into a more unified set of functionality, a modern analytics data platform. Let’s look at how this works in Google Cloud. [...] ## A platform for all users throughout the data life cycle\n\nData work is rarely done by a single individual; there are many data-related users in an organization who play important roles in the data life cycle. Each has a different perspective on data governance, freshness, discoverability, metadata, processing timelines, queryability, and more. In most cases, they are all using different systems and software to operate on the same data, at different stages of processing."
