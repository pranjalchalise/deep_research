Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad(2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Riya Jha\n\nTeam Sathi(2021)\n\n“I had worked on multiple projects before, but working with Incubate Nepal was something really different and amazing. We started off by setting goals and then created plans to achieve the milestones. The best part was the teamwork we had to solve any significant issues and yes the mentorship that we got here was life altering.This was probably the best experience I ever had. And now that slots for the next iteration are open, this is your chance to build connections and work on real life problems with the best mentors. Be Yourself, know your strengths and flaws, and just give your best.\n\n2021\n\n## Ayusha Shrestha\n\nTeam Swasthya Samata(2021)"
