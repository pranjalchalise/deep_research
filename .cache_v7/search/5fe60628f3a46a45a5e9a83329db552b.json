      "snippet": "Outside his role as the acting CEO of Pax, Marius is a skilled painter. He graduated with honors from the Florence College of Art, a time he describes as special and extremely happy,, and he has returned to Stellis for post-graduate studies in art and art history in addition to his duties at Pax. He credits Van Kerrel with beginning his interest in art, having attended an auction he ran at age five.\n\nTo distinguish Marius from his brother, directors and veteran Pax employees refer to him as \"Mr. Marius,\" while outsiders tend to buy into his rich brat persona and call him \"Master Marius\" or, more respectfully, \"Mr. von Hagen.\"\n\n### Childhood[edit | edit source] [...] Marius attended Starhigh High School, Stellis' most prestigious private school, but he only stayed for a year. His status as a von Hagen made him the target of significant unwanted attention, and when false rumors of a feud between him and his brother made the situation worse and affected Giann's recent position at Pax, Marius left the country at age 16 to attend high school abroad instead to protect his family, claiming it would help him get used to foreign cultures before his enrollment at the Florence College of Art. The move required him to start over since his previous credits weren't accepted, but he attained all necessary credits to graduate in only two years.\n\n## Personality and Interests[edit | edit source] [...] It is difficult to understand this second young master. The inconvenient demands Marius must deal with every day are unimaginable. The public and secret battles against the top executives of the family conglomerate is not for the faint hearted. Moreover, he dislikes hypocritical social rules and refuses to give face to those who flatter and fawn. Perhaps instead of inheriting the family business, he would rather be free and unconstrained in creating art. Marius has completed an undergraduate course majoring in oil painting at the reputable Florence College of Art and is presently studying in the art department of Stellis University. One may think this kind of young master is ignorant and incompetent, but Marius' paintings are absolutely amazing. If one has the chance, it is highly"

      "snippet": "Born into the epicenter of the struggles of power. Marius grew tired of the endless scheming and politics. It's an unescapable masquerade ball, and all Marius hopes for is for him to never find his ball partner and let him be the only one that gets sucked into this bottomless abyss.\n\n## Background\n\nMarius von Hagen is the second son of Austin von Hagen, the head of the family.\n\nHaving an elite education and passion for the fine arts, Marius was admitted to the world's top art school, Florence College of Art, where he majored in oil painting. In 2029, Marius graduated with a bachelor's degree ahead of time and returned to Stellis to take over the Pax Group as its CEO. [...] Even so, he did not give up on his pursuit of art; he was admitted to Stellis University as a graduate student in the Department of Art and Art History in 2030.\n\nFinding a balance between his job and academic studies was the first dilemma Marius faced. While many business and financial experts often call Marius \"young and arrogant\", such harsh comments are rarely heard from within the company, which sparked various public speculations.\n\n(Source: Big Data Lab)\n\n## Relationships\n\n## Trivia\n\n## Card List [...] ## Appearance\n\nMarius is a tall young man with purple-toned hair, purple eyes, and fair skin. He is typically seen wearing several piercings, a black logo t-shirt, a white button-down overshirt and denim pants. He wears two necklaces, the foremost visible one being a dog tag inscribed with the letter \"Z\" and a pendant necklace hidden under his shirt.\n\n## Personality\n\nHeir to a global corporation who yearns for freedom.\nAn heir to a massive corporation whose ways are always out of the ordinary, and who never follow the rules.\n\nMarius has a carefree and rebellious playboy public image, all to hide his true self. This is also the reason why the public doubts whether he is capable of inheriting and leading such a vast family corporation."

      "snippet": "Marius was born in Cereatae c. 157 BC, a small village near the town of Arpinum in south-east Latium. The town had been conquered by the Romans in the late 4th century BC and was initially given Roman citizenship without voting rights (civitas sine suffragio). Only in 188 BC, thirty years before his birth, did the town receive full citizenship. Although Plutarch claims that Marius's father was a labourer, this is almost certainly false since Marius had connections with the nobility in Rome, he ran for local office in Arpinum, and he had marriage relations with the local nobility in Arpinum, all of which when taken together indicate that he was born into a locally important family of equestrian \"Equestrian (Roman)\") status. While many of the problems he faced during his early career in [...] Shortly after Marius had vanquished the western invaders at Aquae Sextiae, Marius received news that he had been re-elected to his fourth consecutive consulship (and fifth consulship as a whole) as consul for 101 BC. His colleague would be his friend Manius Aquillius. After election, he returned to Rome to announce his victory at Aquae Sextiae, deferred a triumph, and promptly marched north with his army to join Catulus, whose command was prorogued since Marius's consular colleague was dispatched to defeat a slave revolt in Sicily. [...] Marius attained his first consulship in 107 BC and became the commander of Roman forces in Numidia, where he brought an end to the Jugurthine War. By 105 BC Rome faced an invasion by the Cimbri and Teutones, and the comitia centuriata elected Marius consul for a second time to face this new threat. Marius was consul every year from 104 to 100 BC, and he defeated the Teutones at Aquae Sextiae and the Cimbri at Vercellae. However, Marius suffered political setbacks during his sixth consulship in 100 BC and afterwards entered a period of semi-retirement from public life."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] External Websites\n\n Encyclopedia Romana - The Life of Marius\n Western Oregon University - The Role of Mariusï¿½s Military Reforms in the Decline of the Roman Republic\n The Classical Association of South Africa - Gaius and Marcus in Iberia and Gaul: Family Affairs and Provincial Clients\n World History Encyclopedia - Gaius Marius\n UNRV History - Biography of Gaius Marius\n The Roman Empire - Gaius Marius, the 1st one to shake the Roman Republic\n Colorado Pressbooks Network - Ancient Rome ï¿½ Sourcebook and Historical Atlas - Gaius Marius\n\n# Gaius Marius\n\nRoman general\n\nWritten by\n\nJohn P.V.

The younger Marius reached the estate of Mucius, but as he was getting supplies and packing them up, day overtook him and he did not altogether escape the vigilance of his enemies; for some horsemen came riding towards the place, moved by suspicion. 7 When the overseer of the farm saw them coming, he hid Marius in a waggon loaded with beans, yoked up his oxen, and met the horsemen as he was driving the waggon to the city. In this way young Marius was conveyed to the house of his wife, where he got what he wanted, and then by night came to the sea, boarded a ship that was bound for Africa, and crossed over. [...] he turned aside for the while from the road, plunged into a deep forest, and there spent the night in great distress. But the next day, compelled by want, and wishing to make use of his strength before it failed him altogether, he wandered along the shore, trying to encourage his companions, and begging them not to p565give up the struggle before his last hope could be realized, for which he was still reserving himself in reliance on ancient prophecies. 5 When, that is, he was quite young and living in the country, he had caught in his cloak a falling eagle's nest, which had seven young ones in it; at sight of this, his parents were amazed, and made enquiries of the seers, who told them that their son would be most illustrious of men, and was destined to receive the highest command and [...] The Roman governor of Africa at this time was Sextilius, a man who had received neither good nor ill at the hands of Marius, but whom, as it was expected, pity alone would move to give him aid. Hardly, however, had Marius landed with a few companions, p577when an official met him, stood directly in front of him, and said: \"Sextilius the governor forbids thee, Marius, to set foot in Africa; and if thou disobeyest, he declares that he will uphold the decrees of the senate and treat thee as an enemy of Rome.\" 4 When he heard this, Marius was rendered speechless by grief and indignation, and for a long time kept quiet, looking sternly at the official. Then, when asked by him what he had to say, and what answer he would make to the governor, he answered with a deep groan: \"Tell him, then, that"
