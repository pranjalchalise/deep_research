Like when you just know not to go a certain route to work or avoid a situation because you “had a feeling”. At the end of this episode I share a snippet of a session that I recently had that helped me come to a decision that will set up the next direction in life I want to take. It was life changing! We all have choices to make each day on how we are going to perceive our experiences, the habits we have, the thoughts we think, and the feelings we feel, but it is up to US to make those choices.

      "snippet": "# They're called \"podcasts\"\n\nBy David PierceDesign by Cath VirginiaBuilt by Graham MacAree\n\nBefore a podcast was a “podcast,” it was… well, it wasn’t really much of anything. A few of the early believers called them “audio blogs,” and the journalist often credited with coining the term “podcast” also offered “GuerillaMedia” as an alternative in the very same article. (And actually, there’s plenty of debate over exactly who coined the term and when. The history of the podcast is more contentious than you’d think.) [...] It was in 2004, though, that many of the earliest names in on-demand audio began to smush “iPod” and “broadcast” into the word we’ve come to know as the way we all download and listen to shows now. In the 20 years since podcasts became a thing, they’ve changed dramatically — the earliest pods were mostly just dudes blogging into microphones, but now the medium supports everything from award-winning investigations to narrative fiction on par with anything you’d find on TV. And to be fair, a lot of dudes blogging into microphones. [...] On this episode of The Vergecast, we go back two decades to the first days of the podcast. We talk to some of the people who created the earliest shows, decided how the format would work, and developed both the technology and the norms that still define the industry today. Like so many stories during the early days of the internet, it involves a small number of people (and a Yahoo mailing list) who had no idea how big their little project would get."
