      "snippet": "Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807 – October 12, 1870) was a Confederate general whose early actions in the American Civil War led to his appointment as the overall commander of the Confederate States Army near the end of the war. He led the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy's most powerful army, from 1862 until its surrender in 1865, earning a reputation as one of the war's most skilled tacticians. [...] Lee's first field assignment was commanding Confederate forces in western Virginia, where he was defeated at the Battle of Cheat Mountain and was widely blamed for Confederate setbacks. He was then sent to organize the coastal defenses along the Carolina and Georgia seaboard, appointed commander, \"Department of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida\" on November 5, 1861. Between then and the fall of Fort Pulaski, April 11, 1862, he put in place a defense of Savannah that proved successful in blocking Federal advance on Savannah. Confederate fort and naval gunnery dictated nighttime movement and construction by the besiegers. Federal preparations required four months. In those four months, Lee developed a defense in depth. Behind Fort Pulaski on the Savannah River, Fort Jackson was improved, [...] In 1865, Lee became president of Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia; as president of the college, he supported reconciliation between the North and South. Lee accepted the termination of slavery provided for by the Thirteenth Amendment, but opposed racial equality for African Americans. After his death in 1870, Lee became a cultural icon in the South and is largely hailed as one of the Civil War's greatest generals. As commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, he fought most of his battles against armies of significantly larger size, and managed to win many of them. Lee built up a collection of talented subordinates, most notably James Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson, and J. E. B. Stuart, who along with Lee were critical to the Confederacy's"

      "snippet": "| Robert E. Lee is well known as a Confederate military general, but perhaps his greatest contribution to the United States was his effort to reunite the country following the American Civil War. In the opinions of his contemporaries and historians, Lee played a crucial role in restoring peace following the war.    The American Civil War was the most catastrophic event in the United States’ history. Over the course of four years of ruthless war, upwards of 620,000 people – U.S. and Confederate – lost their lives. This was more than two percent of the entire population of the US and Confederate states combined. In the Confederate states, 30 percent of the military aged white men died. The trauma affected nearly every home across the nation.    In addition to the human carnage, the war [...] as a Confederate general showcased brilliant maneuvers. His grace in defeat set the tone for reunion. In his book April 1865, Jay Winik declared that “by this one momentous decision, he spared the country from the divisive guerilla warfare that surely would have followed.”(/arho/learn/historyculture/lee-s-work-for-reunification.htm#5)    Lee and his fellow Confederate leaders feared for their treatment as possible prisoners of war. In many rebellions around the world, victors often humiliated or denigrated defeated leaders before executing them. At Appomattox, General Ulysses S. Grant gave Lee’s army very generous terms, allowing them to be paroled and sent home if they promised not to take up arms against the United States again. These generous terms were in the spirit of President"

      "snippet": "In reflecting on Robert E. Lee’s contributions as an educator and leader in the post-Civil War period, it is worth emphasizing that the Southern economy was in ruins.  The rail system was shattered and agriculture in shambles. Farmers lacked work animals for plowing fields.  Many former soldiers had few marketable skills.  Some needed remedial education.  Under Lee’s direction Washington College provided learning opportunities.  For the benefit of young men who had been prevented by the war from obtaining adequate preparation for college, the college even offered elementary instruction in Latin, Greek, mathematics and English.(#_ftn14) [...] This thoughtful assessment of Lee’s leadership, published in 2012, comports with earlier positive assessments of Lee’s presidency, including comments of the general’s contemporaries.  Virginia historian Marshall Fishwick wrote in glowing terms in 1950 about Lee’s contributions to higher education.   “Lee is the college president whose innovations gave new life to Southern education.” Writing in 1981, Charles Bracelen Flood concluded that “Lee used his new position to create a model educational institution and to exemplify for a deeply wounded nation the healing powers of compassion, generosity, and conciliation.”   Perhaps the most enthusiastic of Lee’s performance after the Civil War was offered by a biographer Philip Van Doren Stern.  \"What Lee did on the field,\" Stern concludes, \"made [...] In 1907, the centennial of Robert E. Lee’s birth, public figures in America praised the general for promoting national harmony after the Civil War.   They lauded his innovative contributions to college education in his native war-ravaged Virginia.  “Once the war was over,” President Theodore Roosevelt said, “he instantly undertook the task of healing and binding up the wounds of his countrymen, in the true spirit of those who feel malice toward none and charity toward all . . . . “ Roosevelt added that General Lee devoted all of his power “to the reconciliation of all his countrymen with one another, and to fitting the youth of the South for the duties of a lofty and broad-minded citizenship.”(#_ftn1)"

      "snippet": "Robert E. Lee was a prominent Confederate general during the American Civil War, born in 1807 in Virginia. He came from a distinguished family, with a father who was an accomplished cavalry officer in the Revolutionary War. Lee graduated second in his class from the United States Military Academy at West Point and had a career in the army that included service in the Mexican War and as a superintendent at West Point. When the Civil War erupted, he chose to side with Virginia, resigning his commission in the Union Army to lead the Confederate forces. Lee gained fame for his military strategies, particularly during key battles such as Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, though he faced significant challenges and defeats, notably at Gettysburg. After the war, he became president of [...] ## Life’s Work\n\nLee’s tenure as a field officer emerged during the Mexican War and placed him in the public eye. He received the brevet rank of major for his performance as a staff officer in the early campaigns, after which he transferred to the staff of General Winfield Scott for the major invasion of central Mexico. Lee contributed materially to the capture of Veracruz in April, 1847; through his placing artillery and reconnoitering in several battles, he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel. After the attack on Chapultepec, in which he was wounded, he became brevet colonel. [...] In terms of military tacticians, Robert E. Lee became a legend in his own time. His achievements on the field of battle established him as one of the greatest army commanders in history. Not merely an inspiring leader, he made correct, informed judgments about his enemy, then struck decisively. As a theater strategist, he became a master of the mobile feint, thanks largely to several able lieutenants. Stonewall Jackson’s fast-moving so-called foot cavalry thrust into the Shenandoah Valley to draw away troops from McClellan during the Peninsular Campaign. J. E. B. Stuart’s cavalry dominated the Union armies in every campaign. However, both these commanders were killed, in 1863 and 1864, respectively. At the same time, in grand strategy Lee was not adept, having misjudged Union intentions"

Wool's army from San Antonio to Buena Vista, 1846–47, and with Gen. Winfield Scott's army from Vera Cruz to Mexico City, 1847. As Scott's chief of staff during the Mexican War, Lee won three brevets—major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel—all because of conspicuous gallantry in the field. After the Mexican War Lee directed the building of Fort Carroll, near Baltimore, Maryland. From September 1, 1852, until March 31, 1855, he was superintendent of the United States Military Academy. On March 3, 1855, Congress had authorized two new regiments of infantry and two of cavalry to help protect the 8,000-mile western frontier. Against 11,000 troops were 30,000 Indians in widely [...] Virginia and a brief stint as military advisor to Jefferson Davis, Lee succeeded Gen. Joseph E. Johnston to the command of the Confederate Army before Richmond, on June 1, 1862. Again and again his military genius brought victory to the South—at Seven Days (June 25-July 1, 1962), at Bull Run (August 29, 1862), along Antietam Creek (September 14–17, 1862); at Fredericksburg (December 13, 1862); and at Chancellorsville (May 2–4, 1863). After the battle of Gettysburg (July 1–3, 1863), Lee's star of fortune passed its zenith. He left Northern territory for the last time. Gen. U. S. Grant drove Lee's troops through the Virginia wilderness, captured Richmond, and then on April 9, 1865, forced his surrender at Appomattox. Lee returned to civil life. In September 1865 he accepted the presidency [...] Robert Edward Lee, army officer and commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during the Civil War, spent several crucial years of his career in Texas. Lee was born on January 19, 1807, at Stratford Hall, Westmoreland County, Virginia, the son of Gen. Henry and Ann (Carter) Lee. He graduated second in his class at the United States Military Academy in 1829. On June 30, 1831, while stationed at Fort Monroe he married Mary Custis of Arlington, Virginia; they became the parents of seven children. Lee was quite devoted to his family, and as often as military duty would permit, he spent much time at home. He had a wide variety of assignments—working in the chief engineer's office, Washington, D.C., 1834–37; supervising construction on the St. Louis harbor, 1837; and serving with"
