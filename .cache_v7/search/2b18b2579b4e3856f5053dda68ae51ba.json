      "snippet": "The influence of historical study on Claudius is obvious. In his speech on Gallic senators, he uses a version of the founding of Rome identical to that of Livy, his tutor in adolescence. Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by Julius Caesar. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies. [...] In the 1981 Franco-Italian film Caligula and Messalina, he was portrayed by Gino Turini (as John Turner).\n The 1985 made-for-television miniseries A.D. features actor Richard Kiley as Claudius. Kiley portrays him as thoughtful, but willing to cater to public opinion as well as being under the influence of Agrippina.\n There is also a reference to Claudius's suppression of a coup in the movie Gladiator \"Gladiator (2000 film)\"), though that incident is entirely fictional.\n In the 2004 TV film Imperium: Nero \"Nero (2004 film)\"), Claudius is portrayed by Massimo Dapporto.\n In the series Britannia (2018), Claudius visits Britannia, played by Steve Pemberton as a fool who is drugged by Aulus Plautius. [...] Despite his lack of experience, Claudius was an able and efficient administrator. He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen, and helped restore the empire's finances after the excesses of Caligula's reign. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign, the Empire started its successful conquest of Britain. Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued edicts daily. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position, which resulted in the deaths of many senators. Those events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised that opinion."

It is a sign of her overt influence that a new colony on the Rhine bore her name.](#Note 22)Agrippina's powerful position facilitated the advancement of her son Domitius and was, in turn, strengthened by it. Claudius already had a natural son, Britannicus, who was still a minor. Domitius, at 13, was three years older. Now Claudius began to advance Domitius through various signs of favor, the most important being his adoption as Claudius's son on 25 February AD 50. Henceforth Domitius was known as Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus Caesar and known to posterity simply as \"Nero\". But Claudius openly advanced Nero in other ways, too: the emperor [...] but the rise of powerful individuals like Narcissus, Polybius, and Pallas was a distinctive mark of Claudius's reign. The power of these men was demonstrated early on when the emperor chose Narcissus as his envoy to the legions as they hesitated to embark on their invasion of Britain.](#Note 18) According to our sources, the freedmen were frequently to exert less beneficent influences throughout Claudius's reign. [...] Ti. Claudius Nero Germanicus (b. 10 BC, d. 54 A.D.; emperor, 41-54 A.D.) was the third emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. His reign represents a turning point in the history of the Principate for a number of reasons, not the least for the manner of his accession and the implications it carried for the nature of the office. During his reign he promoted administrators who did not belong to the senatorial or equestrian classes, and was later vilified by authors who did. He followed Caesar in carrying Roman arms across the English Channel into Britain but, unlike his predecessor, he initiated the full-scale annexation of Britain as a province, which remains today the most closely studied corner of the Roman Empire. His relationships with his wives and children provide detailed insights"

      "snippet": "Claudius is often depicted with a pronounced limp and possessing a stutter, most famously in the award-winning 1976 BBC series I Claudius. These disabilities probably had some truth in them and his family humiliated and alienated him as a young man, with his own mother calling him a ‘monstrosity’.\n\nClaudius was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty which comprised of 5 emperors – Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. Here are 10 facts about Claudius, the Roman Emperor who conquered Britain.\n\n## 1. He was a keen scholar\n\nThe young Claudius never imagined he would become emperor and devoted his time to learning. He fell in love with history after he was assigned an influential tutor, the Roman historian Livy, who inspired him to pursue a career as a historian. [...] ## 3. He was a paranoid ruler\n\nClaudius became emperor on 25 January 41 and changed his name to Caesar Augustus Germanicus to legitimise his rule, becoming the most powerful man in the Roman Empire. He generously rewarded the Praetorian Guard handsomely for their assistance in making him emperor.\n\nThe 50-year-old’s first act of power was to grant an amnesty to all conspirators linked to the assassination of his nephew Caligula. Paranoia and realising how vulnerable he was to assassination himself led Claudius to execute many senators to shore up his position and eradicate potential plots against him.\n\nKilling those he felt posed a threat has somewhat tarnished Claudius’ reputation as a balanced and efficient ruler who restored the finances of the Roman Empire. [...] # 10 Facts About Emperor Claudius\n\n#### Richard Bevan\n\n##### 29 Nov 2021\n\nClaudius, born Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus, was one of Rome’s most famous and successful emperors, reigning from 41 AD to 54 AD.\n\nAfter the short and bloody reign of Claudius’ nephew Caligula, who had ruled as a tyrant, Rome’s senators wanted to return to a more republican form of government. The powerful Praetorian Guard turned to an inexperienced and seemingly simple-minded man they thought could be controlled and used as a puppet. Claudius turned out to be an astute and decisive leader."

      "snippet": "In the civil administration, many measures demonstrate Claudius’s enlightened policy. He improved in detail the judicial system, and, in his dealings with the provinces, he favoured a moderate extension of Roman citizenship by individual and collective grants: in Noricum, a district south of the Danube comprising what is now central Austria and parts of Bavaria, for instance, five communities became Roman municipalities. He encouraged urbanization and planted several colonies, for example, at Camulodunum and at Colonia Agrippinensis (modern Cologne) in Germany in 51. In his religious policy Claudius respected tradition; he revived old religious ceremonies, celebrated the festival of the Secular Games in 47 (three days and nights of games and sacrifice commemorating the 800th birthday of [...] Claudius’s decision to invade Britain (43) and his personal appearance at the climax of the expedition, the crossing of the Thames and the capture of Camulodunum (Colchester), were prompted by his need of popularity and glory. But concern with the anti-Roman influence of the Druid priesthood, which he tried to suppress in Gaul, and a general inclination toward expanding the frontiers were other reasons. Claudius planted a colony of veterans at Camulodunum and established client-kingdoms to protect the frontiers of the province; these were afterward a source of trouble, such as the revolt in 47 of Prasutagus, client-king of the Iceni, and later the general revolt instigated by his wife Boudicca (also called Boadicea). He also annexed Mauretania (41–42) in North Africa, of which he made two [...] The son of Nero Claudius Drusus, a popular and successful Roman general, and the younger Antonia, he was the nephew of the emperor Tiberius and a grandson of Livia Drusilla, the wife of the emperor Augustus. Ill health, unattractive appearance, clumsiness of manner, and coarseness of taste did not recommend him for a public life. The imperial family seems to have considered him something of an embarrassment, and he was long left to his own private studies and amusements. It was the historian Livy who recognized and encouraged his inclination for historical studies. Claudius wrote a pamphlet defending the republican politician and orator Cicero, who was executed by the triumvirs; and, having discovered that it was difficult to speak freely on the civil wars toward the end of the Roman"

Best know for the successful expansion of Rome into Britain and parts of Africa and the Middle East, Claudius was an accomplished leader who brought forth improvements to the empire's judicial system, passed laws protecting enslaved workers, extended Roman citizenship and gave citizens more rights. [...] In A.D. 43, he dispatched a force of 40,000 troops and several war elephants across the English Channel. The Romans had soon conquered a stronghold at modern day Colchester, and eventually succeeding in capturing the Catuvellauni tribal leader Caratacus. Claudius visited Britain during the invasion and remained for 16 days before returning to a hero’s welcome in Rome. He was later honored with a triumphal arch on the Via Flaminia that hailed him as the man who “brought barbarian peoples beyond Ocean for the first time under Rome’s sway.”\n\n6.\n\n## He was an avid fan of the Roman games."

Discovered trembling in the palace by one of his own soldiers, he was clearly reluctant and afraid.    He had good reason: like his predecessors, Claudius could never be too sure of his position. Supported mainly by soldiers and courtiers, he had a rocky relationship with the Senate. Many senators supported the abortive rebellion in the Balkans in 42 AD and they featured in many of the plots against his life.    Surprisingly popular     Despite these dangers, Claudius worked hard at his job, starting work just after midnight every day.
