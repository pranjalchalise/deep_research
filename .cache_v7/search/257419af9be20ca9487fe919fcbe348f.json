Today we're releasing our first ambient agent of the week - an executive AI email assistant. This agent is built on top of a pattern we believe will be widely adopted throughout the agents released this year, and in years to come. Ambient agents are AI applications which can suggest actions to the user, then await your approval, feedback, or edits before executing the action. This pattern enables whole hosts of agent applications which would not have been fully trusted by users before, like an email assistant.

      "snippet": "Robert Charles Sproul (/sproʊl/ SPROHL; February 13, 1939 – December 14, 2017) was an American Reformed theologian, Christian apologist, and ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America. He was the founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, and could be heard daily on the Renewing Your Mind radio broadcast internationally. [...] Sproul was a critic of postmodern philosophy. He considered postmodern thinking as a seduction to the church. This seduction originated towards the end of the cultural revolution of the 1960s and produced \"the most narcissistic generation in the history of the human race.\" Sproul saw churches responding to that cultural change by \"adopting the use of sound bites, entertainment, and that sort of thing\" in replacement of using biblical teaching directly. Further, he found that this infiltration of postmodernity led to a \"revival of ancient Gnosticism\" with a \"wide spread rejection of rationality\" within the Christian church. He believed that many churches, as a result of this rejection, now teach that \"biblical revelation is only intelligible by intuition or by a particularly sensitive [...] Sproul was an advocate of Reformed theology in his many print, audio, and video publications, and advocated the Thomistic (classical) approaches to Christian apologetics, less common among Reformed apologists, most of whom prefer presuppositionalism.[citation needed] A dominant theme in his Renewing Your Mind lessons is the holiness and sovereignty of God. Sproul taught that headcovering should be practiced in churches as the ordinance is \"rooted and grounded in creation\"."

      "snippet": "Robert Charles Sproul was born on February 13, 1939, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the second child of Robert Cecil Sproul and the former Mayre Ann Yardis. R.C.’s great grandfather immigrated to the United States in the nineteenth-century from Donegal, Ireland. R.C.’s early childhood years were defined largely by two things: World War II and his extended family. He was two years old when World War II broke out. His father, being too old for the draft, was appointed head of the draft board in his district. Only a few weeks after being appointed to his position, R.C.’s father came home in uniform and announced that he had enlisted in the army air corps because he couldn’t send others overseas into battle if he didn’t go himself. R.C.’s father was an honorable man, and he was known throughout [...] In 1997, Saint Andrew’s Chapel was established when a group of lay people sought the Lord’s direction in planting a church in the Reformed tradition where the whole counsel of God would be preached and where the Lord would be worshiped with reverence. The small congregation of committed Christians called Dr. Sproul to serve as their senior minister of preaching and teaching. They began meeting in the recording studio at Ligonier Ministries, and from there the congregation began to meet in a local movie theatre. Quickly growing out of the theatre, they moved into the cafeteria of a small private school, and a few years later, in 2001, the congregation built its first sanctuary. [...] father was an honorable man, and he was known throughout the community for his integrity. Just prior to his deployment overseas, R.C.’s father invited his brother and family to live in the Sproul home, and there they resided for ten years."
