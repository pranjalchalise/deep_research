      "snippet": "In 1974, Tsung-Dao (T.D.) Lee visited a dance academy in Shanghai and came up with an idea: shao nian ban, the Special Class for the Gifted Young. Thirty years later, I studied physics in China at the program Lee had conceived. For generations of Chinese scientists including myself, we owe much of our careers to Lee, not just for his contributions to particle physics, but also for his unparalleled efforts in advancing higher education in China and facilitating U.S.-China scientific exchange. A professor emeritus at Columbia University and one of the first two Chinese-born Nobel laureates, Lee passed away on Aug. 4. He was 97. [...] As an unofficial adviser to the Chinese government and a scientific ambassador between his birth country and his adopted home, Lee was instrumental in a wide range of education and exchange programs in China. The China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application (CUSPEA) program, initiated and managed by Lee, provided one of the first pathways for Chinese students to attend graduate school in the U.S. in the post-Mao era. [...] Driven by an insatiable curiosity, an eye for beauty and a deep love for humanity, Lee’s work probed the mysteries of the universe and illuminated the intricate relations between science and the state. His legacy holds rich lessons and leaves many questions on how nature works and how scientists should fulfill their civic duties.\n\n### Obituaries\n\n### Nobel Prize-winning physicist Tsung-Dao Lee has died at age 97"

      "snippet": "Along with his collaborator Chen Ning Yang, T. D. Lee was the first Chinese Nobel Prize laureate. He received the prize when he was just 31 years old, which made him the youngest scientist to receive this prestigious award after World War II. In his more than 300 papers, Lee has made momentous contributions to various branches of theoretical physics, including particle physics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, astrophysics and hydrodynamics. The work that gained Lee and Yang the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics was the analysis of the status of parity conservation in weak interactions, carried out in 1956. This research led to the experimental discovery that neither parity (P) nor charge conjugation (C) is conserved in weak interactions. The words written [...] with him two relevant papers on statistical mechanics, which solved some problems affecting the theory of phase transitions. Lee and Yang showed that one could get different thermodynamic functions (pressure, density) for different phases (gas, liquid or solid). This argument led to the formulation of the “unit circle theorem” concerning the partition functions used for ferromagnetic systems in statistical field theory. In 1953, Lee was appointed Assistant Professor at the Columbia University of New York City. Although Yang remained at Princeton, their collaboration was not disrupted, and in the next few years Lee and Yang continued to make several contributions, including the endeavour that gained them the Nobel Prize. [...] In 1974, Lee and Giancarlo Wick published an important and detailed study on vacuum stability in quantum field theory and on the experimental possibilities for observing a degenerate state whose energy might be lower than that of the vacuum state. According to them, in heavy nuclei the broken symmetry of the vacuum might be restored. Their investigation proposed the existence of metastable “bubbles” in the vacuum. For fermions at high density, the total energy of the excited states would be lower than that of the normal state. A certain number of fermions might, therefore, be bound together in a stable union in a region of “abnormal” space. This paper and the subsequent elaborations made by Lee are currently being tested at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at the Brookhaven National"

      "snippet": "In the early 1960s, Lee and collaborators initiated the important field of high-energy neutrino physics. In 1964, Lee, with M. Nauenberg, analyzed the divergences connected with particles of zero rest mass, and described a general method known as the KLN theorem for dealing with these divergences, which still plays an important role in contemporary work in QCD, with its massless, self-interacting gluons. In 1974–75, Lee published several papers on \"A New Form of Matter in High Density\", which led to the modern field of RHIC physics, now dominating the entire high-energy nuclear physics field.[citation needed] [...] | Scientists   Röntgen  Witten  Becquerel  Lorentz  Planck  Curie  Wien  Skłodowska-Curie  Sommerfeld  Rutherford  Soddy  Onnes  Einstein  Wilczek  Born  Weyl  Bohr  Kramers  Schrödinger  de Broglie  Laue  Bose  Compton  Pauli  Walton  Fermi  van der Waals  Heisenberg  Dyson  Zeeman  Moseley  Hilbert  Gödel  Jordan  Dirac  Wigner  Hawking  P.

In 1983, Lee wrote a paper entitled, \"Can Time Be a Discrete Dynamical Variable?\"; which led to a series of publications by Lee and collaborators on the formulation of fundamental physics in terms of difference equations, but with exact invariance under continuous groups of translational and rotational transformations. Beginning in 1975, Lee and collaborators established the field of non-topological solitons, which led to his work on soliton stars and black holes throughout the 1980s and 1990s.[citation needed]"

She published four papers in her own name and contributed to 26 others. Twice she declined to be listed as a co-author of a paper published by Pearson, arguing that she had only done the arithmetic. She was in the process of establishing a reputation as a statistician. For her dissertation she had developed a statistical model that estimated the cranial volume of living humans from external skull measurements. Her research on the statistical analysis of within species variation, a branch of evolutionary biology, continued until 1910 and led her to publish a succession of papers in the Biometrika from 1902 onwards.

Flaws in craniology had been pointed out in the 19th century, but in the 1900s, craniology was discredited by empirical data. The final blow came in 1909 when Franklin P. Mall applied statistical measures to the study of the frontal lobe and fissures \"Fissure (anatomy)\") of the human brain, which had been associated with racial and sex differences, in his paper On several anatomical characters of the human brain, said to vary according to race and sex, with especial reference to the weight of the frontal lobe. He found no differences between male and female brains.\n\n## Publications\n\n[edit&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Publications\")]"

      "snippet": "By Dylan Loeb McClain\n\nTsung-Dao Lee, a Chinese American physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for overturning what had been considered a fundamental law of nature — that particles are always symmetrical — died on Sunday at his home in San Francisco. He was 97.\n\nHis death was announced in a joint statement by the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute at the Jiao Tong University in Shanghai and the China Center for Advanced Science and Technology in Beijing. Dr. Lee was a longtime professor at Columbia University.\n\nThe theory that Dr. Lee overturned was called the law of conservation of parity, which said that every phenomenon and its mirror image should behave precisely the same. At the time he challenged the theory, in 1956, it had been widely accepted for 30 years. [...] Dr. Lee was then a young professor at Columbia, where he had been promoted to full professor at age 29 — the youngest in the university’s history at that point.\n\nHe had become intrigued by a problem involving the decay of so-called K mesons, which are subatomic particles. These particles decay all the time, forming electrons, neutrinos and photons. Experiments had shown that when K mesons decayed, some exhibited changes that suggested that each differed from the others. But they also had identical masses and life expectancies, indicating that they were the same.
