Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad(2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] 2020\n\n## Aarasi Shrestha\n\nTeam Arthasastra(2020)\n\n“Incubate Nepal provided students like me with a platform to share our knowledge on a wide range of topics, hone our leadership skills and team spirit, and it acted as a stepping stone towards accomplishing our future goals and ambitions. Being a team member of ‘Team Arthasastra,' my teammates and I prepared an empirical Economics research paper. Last-minute virtual meetings to complete the tasks that we were assigned, late nights of watching YouTube videos and reading articles on econometrics, and listening to the amazing weekly presentations from different groups helped me in more ways than I thought it would.”\n\n2020\n\n## Mahesh Yadav\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020)"

      "snippet": "### 5.5 Quantitative evaluation\n\nWe report the average deviation from the ground truth trajectory across four scenarios. BNNs show significant gains in high-risk settings.\n\n• Clear Road: BNN = 0.21 m, NN = 0.32 m,\n\n• Intersection: BNN = 0.36 m, NN = 0.58 m,\n\n• Occlusion: BNN = 0.39 m, NN = 0.67 m,\n\n• Adverse Weather: BNN = 0.38 m, NN = 0.61 m.\n\nThese results reflect a 32%–42% reduction in error with BNNs, emphasizing their effectiveness in risk-aware path planning.\n\n### 5.6 Discussion and conclusion\n\nBNNs provide a principled mechanism for incorporating uncertainty into obstacle avoidance tasks. Compared to traditional NNs, they offer.\n\n• Calibrated caution via probabilistic confidence bounds.\n\n• More robust performance in ambiguous or degraded conditions. [...] 2. Obstacle avoidance in real-time, partially observable settings.\n\n3. Weather-adaptive planning under visual degradation.\n\nWe propose a unified probabilistic framework for trajectory prediction and evaluate it through three case studies combining real and augmented data. Our findings show that BNNs outperform deterministic models in safety, adaptability, and interpretability, highlighting their promise for robust autonomous navigation.\n\n## 2 State of the art\n\n### 2.1 Deep learning in autonomous navigation [...] ### 2.2 Bayesian neural networks and uncertainty modeling\n\nBNNs extend standard neural networks by treating weights as probability distributions rather than fixed parameters. This allows the model to capture both epistemic (model-related) and aleatoric (input-related) uncertainty (Kendall and Gal, 2017). Methods such as variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout enable practical approximations for training and inference (Mena et al., 2021).\n\nBNNs have been applied successfully in healthcare (Ngartera et al., 2024), object tracking (Nie et al., 2018), and risk-sensitive control. However, most implementations focus on static perception tasks. The application of BNNs in full-stack autonomous navigation–particularly for planning and trajectory prediction–remains underexplored."

There are various satellite systems providing the DEMs with different spatial resolution freely. This study assesses the reliability of the freely available DEMs while using those data for decision making. Reference elevation point data are taken from the topographical base map of the respective area. Statistical calculation was carried out for the testing reliability of the data. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Standard Deviation and Mean deviation are calculated to conduct the accuracy assessment.

Best results were seen in cases where rigid intertarsal/intercolumnar stability was achieved by screw fixation. There was residual inter-cuneiform subluxation in 4 cases, which were fixed with K-wires, and this led to residual pain. Conservative/neglected cases had poor results. Intercolumnar/intertarsal instabilities should be primarily recognized and stabilized under compression. Stabilization should not only be within the 3 columns but also intercolumnar, thus maintaining the relative length of three columns and hence [...] 12 months postoperatively. At 12 months, the mean AOFAS was 84.24. Five patients (20%) had score more then 90 (excellent), 11 (44%) had score between 81–90 (good), 8 (32%) had score between 71–80 (fair) and 1 (4%) had 70 (poor). Mean AOFAS score improved from 71.36 (at 3 month) to 79.96 (at 6 month) and 84.24 (at 1 year). Mean VAS score at the end of 1 year was 22.4 mm. 17(68%) cases in the study had fracture union without any complications.8 (32%) cases had postoperative complications ranging from superficial wound infection to delayed union and secondary arthrosis.

The device has the least count of 1° for ROM measurement. Tests were done on 20 healthy subjects to measure ROM while performing dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. The results were compared with a traditional CE certified goniometer Abstracts Presented at the Annual Meeting of Indian Foot and Ankle Society (IFASCON 2019) at New Delhi, 2019 Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (Asia-Pacific), Volume 6 Issue 2 (July–December 2019) 63 and digital goniometer app, Goniometer Records (released by Indian Orthopaedic Research Group) and found an accuracy of 96% for ROM measurements.
