      "snippet": "Marius Valdes, Professor, University of South Carolina, won the 2022 SECAC Award for Excellence in Graphic Design. This award is given to recognize a designer or group whose sustained creative activity (within the last two years) is considered exemplary. The award was presented on October 26, 2022, at the annual awards luncheon in Baltimore, MD, during the 78th meeting of SECAC, formerly the Southeastern College Art Conference. [...] Valdes’ letters of nomination highlighted his achievements, including being the recipient of numerous competitive national and international juried awards and more than $50K in grant funding in the last two years. Valdes has been recognized by American Illustration for three consecutive years and also appeared on the shortlist of the 2021 World Illustration Awards in London, UK for Site Specific Illustration. His nominators praised both his talents as a designer and the many qualities that make him a superb colleague, with one nominator stating, “What makes Marius so deserving of this award is the way he lifts everyone up around him. He is one of the kindest and most generous designers that I have the privilege of knowing.” [...] Could not open the file at this location: /usr/local/apache/docs/study/colleges\\_schools/artsandsciences/visual\\_art\\_and\\_design/rss/Visual\\_Art\\_and\\_Design\\_news.xml\n\nSkip to Content\n\nIn-person classes scheduled for Saturday, Jan. 31 will be online.

      "snippet": "After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate [...] Marius soon earned the respect of the troops by his conduct towards them, eating his meals with them and proving he was not afraid to share in any of their labours. He also won over the Italian traders by claiming that he could capture Jugurtha in a few days with half of Metellus's troops. Both groups wrote home in praise of him, suggesting that he could end the war quickly, unlike Metellus, who was pursuing a policy of methodically subduing the countryside. [...] veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate credit for his military successes. Marius was duly returned as consul for 100 BC with Lucius Valerius Flaccus \"Lucius Valerius Flaccus (consul 100 BC)\"); according to Plutarch, he also campaigned on behalf of his colleague so to prevent his rival Metellus Numidicus from securing a seat."

      "snippet": "Marius was both a great general and a sometimes adequate, if not good, politician. He was credited with saving Rome by defeating the Germanics, and created an atmosphere of enfranchisement with the Italians that was a necessity for Roman growth.\n\nThe reform of the legions was of the greatest benefit to the army and Roman power, but perhaps above all else, he was a deep influence on the life of his nephew, Gaius Julius Caesar. [...] Due to a military crisis from Germanic victories in Gaul, Marius was forced to take unprecendented measures and recruit his armies from the Roman landless masses. Even so, within two years, Marius completed what he said he would, conquering Numidia and putting an end to the war.\n\nThough, there was military success in the field, it was through the service of a young patrician officer, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, that the war finally came to a close. Jugurtha himself was betrayed by his ally Bocchus, the King of Mauretania, into the arms of the Romans. Sulla organized the capture, but Marius, having Imperium as Consul, would receive the credit, while Sulla maintained the war only ended through his achievement. [...] Additionally, officers began to be recruited from within the ranks on a regular basis. While political appointments and promotions based on social or client status would still occur, this now allowed the common soldier a way of advancing based on merit.\n\nThis improved the strength of the legion as a whole and instilled confidence in the soldiers, knowing their officers were capable leaders, not favored clients of Senators in Rome.\n\nMarius, while adopting uniform gear for all, such as the gladius and scutum, also made significant changes to the common legionary spear (the pilum). It was made for the point to break off upon impact, making it ineffective to be thrown back by the enemy."
