      "snippet": "## What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that merges two distinct but complementary AI components: retrieval and generation. At its core, RAG works by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge source (such as a database or documents) and then generating a response based on this information. This allows the model to produce more contextually appropriate and informed results.\n\n### How RAG Differs from Traditional AI Approaches [...] By selecting the right tools, you can unlock the full potential of RAG in your projects. Visit Sapien to explore how we can help you implement retrieval augmented generation solutions tailored to your needs and schedule a consult.\n\n## FAQs\n\nHow does RAG work with GPT?\n\nRAG integrates with GPT by retrieving relevant data before generating a response, ensuring greater context and accuracy.\n\nWhat is RAG analysis?\n\nRAG analysis refers to the process of combining information retrieval and text generation to produce well-informed and accurate outputs.\n\nWhat is the value of RAG?\n\nThe primary value of RAG is its ability to combine real-time data with generative models, ensuring responses are both accurate and contextually relevant.\n\nHow to evaluate RAG accuracy? [...] ### Enhancing Information Retrieval Systems\n\nRAG enhances traditional information retrieval systems by fusing the accuracy of search with the creative capabilities of generative models. This has been particularly effective in:\n\n Search Engines: Improving search results with dynamic, generated summaries.\n Knowledge Management Systems: Offering richer insights by generating tailored responses based on the retrieved data.\n\n### Improving Conversational AI\n\nOne of the most exciting applications of RAG is in conversational AI. By retrieving and generating contextually relevant responses, RAG improves the accuracy and fluency of customer service bots and virtual assistants."

      "snippet": "## What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. By incorporating new and context-aware data, AI can generate more accurate, current and domain-specific responses.\n\nRAG is quickly becoming the go-to architecture for building enterprise-grade AI applications. According to recent surveys, over 60% of organizations are developing AI-powered retrieval tools to improve reliability, reduce hallucinations and personalize outputs using internal data. [...] 1. Providing up-to-date and accurate responses: RAG ensures that the response of an LLM is not based solely on static, stale training data. Rather, the model uses up-to-date external data sources to provide responses.\n2. Reducing inaccurate responses, or hallucinations: By grounding the LLM model's output on relevant, external knowledge, RAG attempts to mitigate the risk of responding with incorrect or fabricated information (also known as hallucinations). Outputs can include citations of original sources, allowing human verification.\n3. Providing domain-specific, relevant responses: Using RAG, the LLM will be able to provide contextually relevant responses tailored to an organization's proprietary or domain-specific data. [...] Read now\n\n## How RAG works\n\nRAG enhances a language model’s output by injecting it with context-aware and real-time information retrieved from an external data source. When a user submits a query, the system first engages the retrieval model, which uses a vector database to identify and “retrieve” semantically similar documents, databases or other sources for relevant information. Once identified, it then combines those results with the original input prompt and sends it to a generative AI model, which synthesizes the new information into its own model.\n\nThis allows the LLM to produce more accurate, context-aware answers grounded in enterprise-specific or up-to-date data, rather than simply relying upon the model it was trained on."

      "snippet": "## Page topics\n\n## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts. [...] ### Augment the LLM prompt\n\nNext, the RAG model augments the user input (or prompts) by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. This step uses prompt engineering techniques to communicate effectively with the LLM. The augmented prompt allows the large language models to generate an accurate answer to user queries.\n\n### Update external data\n\nThe next question may be—what if the external data becomes stale? To maintain current information for retrieval, asynchronously update the documents and update embedding representation of the documents. You can do this through automated real-time processes or periodic batch processing. This is a common challenge in data analytics—different data-science approaches to change management can be used. [...] ### Current information\n\nEven if the original training data sources for an LLM are suitable for your needs, it is challenging to maintain relevancy. RAG allows developers to provide the latest research, statistics, or news to the generative models. They can use RAG to connect the LLM directly to live social media feeds, news sites, or other frequently-updated information sources. The LLM can then provide the latest information to the users.\n\n### Enhanced user trust\n\nRAG allows the LLM to present accurate information with source attribution. The output can include citations or references to sources. Users can also look up source documents themselves if they require further clarification or more detail. This can increase trust and confidence in your generative AI solution."

      "snippet": "# What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\n## What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architecture for optimizing the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) model by connecting it with external knowledge bases. RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\n\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs. However, training datasets are finite and limited to the information the AI developer can access—public domain works, internet articles, social media content and other publicly accessible data. [...] Retraining a foundation model or fine-tuning it—where a foundation model is further trained on new data in a smaller, domain-specific dataset—is computationally expensive and resource-intensive. The model adjusts some or all of its parameters to adjust its performance to the new specialized data.\n\nWith RAG, enterprises can use internal, authoritative data sources and gain similar model performance increases without retraining. Enterprises can scale their implementation of AI applications as needed while mitigating cost and resource requirement increases.\n\n### Access to current and domain-specific data [...] ### Access to current and domain-specific data\n\nGenerative AI models have a knowledge cutoff, the point at which their training data was last updated. As a model ages further past its knowledge cutoff, it loses relevance over time. RAG systems connect models with supplemental external data in real-time and incorporate up-to-date information into generated responses.\n\nEnterprises use RAG to equip models with specific information such as proprietary customer data, authoritative research and other relevant documents."
