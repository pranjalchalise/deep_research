Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a criminal complaint with the French police about cyber harassment against X over alleged \"acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.\n\nIn October 2024, Musk and his America PAC were sued in Pennsylvania for allegedly operating an unlawful lottery before the 2024 US presidential election. In November 2024, he was sued again regarding the lottery and two US senators called for a probe into alleged contacts with Vladimir Putin. In August 2025, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman allowed Jacqueline McAferty to proceed with her lottery over the lawsuit. [...] [edit]\n\nIn 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet \"Tweet (social media)\") stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies. Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO. Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet, and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable. Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.

      "snippet": "[edit]\n\nBetween August 10, 2018, and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Elon Musk's August 7, 2018, Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of the suits were consolidated into a class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit asserted claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr. Musk's statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla's securities. In February 2023, the jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.\n\n### Employee theft of Autopilot source code\n\n[edit] [...] In June 2022, Musk, Tesla, and other companies led by him were listed as defendants in a class action lawsuit claiming they participated in a pyramid scheme around the price of Dogecoin. Damages were listed at $258 billion. In an amended complaint in June 2023, the plaintiffs additionally accused Musk of insider trading, when he sold Dogecoin worth $124 million in April shortly after he temporarily replaced the Twitter logo with the Shiba Inu graphic associated with Dogecoin, which caused a 30 percent increase in the cryptocurrency. Judge Alvin Hellerstein dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice in August 2024, writing that no reasonable investor could depend on Musk's tweets to file a securities fraud claim, adding that it was \"not possible to understand\" the insider trading and market [...] ### Corporate litigation relating to the SolarCity acquisition\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween September 1, 2016, and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware challenging Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity. In October 2016, the Court consolidated the actions and appointed a lead plaintiff. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the Tesla board of directors as then constituted breached their fiduciary duties in approving the acquisition and that certain individuals would be unjustly enriched by the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, $13 billion from Elon Musk."

      "snippet": "The lawsuit also argued that shareholders had not been adequately informed when they voted to approve the pay package, because they did not know about the board members' personal ties to Musk and the amount of influence Musk had over the pay proposal.\n\nTornetta brought his suit in Delaware's Court of Chancery, which adjudicates disputes within businesses. At that time, Tesla was incorporated in Delaware, like the majority of large U.S. corporations.\n\nIn court, lawyers for Tesla have repeatedly emphasized that shareholders voted in favor of the pay package, with full disclosure of the eye-popping financial terms of the deal. [...] ### What is the basis of the lawsuit?\n\nIn 2018, a Tesla shareholder named Richard Tornetta filed a suit against Musk, Tesla and Tesla's board of directors accusing members of the board of violating their legal obligation, called a fiduciary duty, to act in the best interests of shareholders and the company overall. Tornetta argued that Musk had too much influence over the board and, in turn, too much influence over how much money he stood to make. (Musk's brother, who serves on the board, recused himself from the pay decision, but some other members of the boards are close friends of Musk's.)

      "snippet": "“Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration is unconstitutional,” said Washington state Governor Bob Ferguson. “If the President wants Musk or any other powerful billionaire to have a significant role in running our government, he can and should appoint them as the Constitution requires.”\n\nThe lawsuit highlights how, with the president’s approval, Musk has unraveled federal agencies, accessed sensitive data, and caused widespread disruption for state and local governments, federal employees, and the American people. The complaint further asserts that Musk’s actions violate the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which ensures that executive appointments are subject to congressional oversight and Senate confirmation. [...] Defendants’ actions threaten the financial and operational stability of the states by disrupting billions of dollars in federal funding essential for law enforcement, healthcare, education, and other critical services. State agencies depend on federal funds and cooperative agreements, and the termination of these partnerships would result in severe budget shortfalls, staffing crises, and the potential loss of key programs. Similarly, the proposed elimination of the U.S. Department of Education would strip away federal civil rights oversight in schools, leaving states with uncertain legal authority to address discrimination cases involving students with disabilities and enforce Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and disability protections. [...] The lawsuit argues that President Trump has violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution by creating a new federal department without congressional approval, and by granting Musk sweeping powers over the entire federal government without the advice and consent of the Senate or accountability to the people of the United States.\n\n“Elon Musk has amassed — or simply taken for himself — unaccountable power to walk into any federal agency, fire people, eliminate programs authorized by Congress, and access confidential personal and national security information without regard for the consequences,” Brown said. “Washingtonians will not stand by while their safety and freedoms are threatened by a lawless administration intent on shredding the Constitution line by line.”"

      "snippet": "## September 27, 2018: The SEC sues Musk\n\nThe SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk in September, alleging that Musk made \"false and misleading statements\" in August about the possibility of taking Tesla private. The agency said in the lawsuit that it sought to bar Musk from being an officer or director of a public company.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the SEC claimed Musk said a representative from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund had shown interest in taking Tesla private, but that Musk had never discussed any of the specific terms he described on Twitter with the Saudi fund or any other potential backers before making them public. Those terms included the proposed $420 share price and an option for all existing Tesla shareholders to remain with the company after it went private."
