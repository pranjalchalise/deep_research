Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad(2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] 2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020)\n\n“Incubate Nepal gave me the opportunity to learn things in a way I never did before. I learned to research, visualize data and more importantly convey and explain my ideas to others. The best part of the program was everyone; be it the mentors or the student themselves motivated each other to do more. It is so much more than just a program and I'm blessed to be a part of this wonderful family!”\n\n2020\n\n## Aarasi Shrestha\n\nTeam Arthasastra(2020)"
