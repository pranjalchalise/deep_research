I await your next project!\n\nDonor MacneiceMar 12 2017 10:44 am Dong Ha is one of the best young actors on the Korean circuit. His performance in \"Good Manager\"or \"Manager Kim\" is a really convincing portrayal of a young man from a high profile family who becomes unhappy with the way his father's huge company treats ts employees. I hope we can see a lot more of Dong Ha on our TV screens in the future, and I also hope that he will get an award for his role as supporting actor in this role.. [...] Donor MacneiceMar 28 2017 11:01 am Dong Ha may handsome and considered cut and sexy, but that is not the point. The important thing is that he is an incredible actor. He is sincere in every roll he plays and this sincerity comes across to the audience. The fact that he is good looking is a plus of course, but it is his acting that is important. I have been in the theatre, radio and TV all my life in Dublin, London and America until I retired. If I was still working, he would be an actor I would want to direct and produce. I would love to get in touch with him as I am often in Korea and live in a neighbouring country. Thank you Dong Ha for all your excellent work and for being also a very nice and humble person.\n\nJangdongMar 28 2017 12:30 am Donghas as Park Meongseok is soooo cute kkkk"
