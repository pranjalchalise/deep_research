      "snippet": "The acronym “RAG” is attributed to the 2020 publication, “Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks”, submitted by Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI). The paper describes RAG as “a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe” because it’s meant to connect any LLM with any internal or external knowledge source.\n\nAs its name suggests, retrieval-augmented generation inserts a data retrieval component into the response generation process to enhance the relevance and reliability of the answers. [...] The retrieval model accesses, selects, and prioritizes the most relevant documents and data from the appropriate sources based on the user’s query, transforms it into an enriched, contextual prompt, and invokes the LLM via its API. The LLM responds with an accurate and coherent response to the user. This is LLM AI learning in action.\n\nA helpful RAG analogy is a stock trader using the combination of publicly available historical financial information and live market feeds.\n\nStock traders in a firm make investment decisions based on analyzing financial markets, industry, and company performance. However, to generate the most profitable trades, they access live market feeds and internal stock recommendations provided by their firm.

In the future, RAG AI might be used to suggest appropriate actions to contextual information and user prompts."

      "snippet": "For instance, the acronym \"RAG\" might refer to \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation\" in a machine learning context but could mean something entirely different in another domain.\n\nGolden-Retriever uses an LLM-driven approach to classify the query into the appropriate context by selecting from a predefined set of categories. This step is vital for ensuring that the system fully understands the query’s intent before proceeding with document retrieval.\n\n#### Step 4: Query Jargons [...] In this artice, we introduce a study called \"Golden-Retriever\", a novel approach designed to enhance the capabilities of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in industrial settings. This framework is particularly focused on overcoming challenges related to domain-specific jargon and context interpretation, which are prevalent in industrial knowledge bases.\n\nThe motivation behind the development of Golden-Retriever stems from the need to efficiently navigate and retrieve information from vast industrial knowledge bases.\n\n## Comparison\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the comparison of existing methods with Golden-Retriever, highlighting the need for a solution that can accurately handle ambiguous terms and provide relevant context before retrieval."

So, what is RAG and when do we use it?\n\nRAG needs to be understood in the context of the larger space of LLMs where it is applied. To understand what is RAG, we need to understand at a high level what is an LLM such as Chatgpt and how it functions. And then we need to identify what is the gap that RAG comes in to bridge.\n\nWhy is corporate uptake of LLMs slower than expected? [...] 3. Content creation, particularly marketing content such as emails, social media posts, etc. [...] RAG Strengths and Limitations\n\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) shows promising effectiveness in providing relevant responses. However it is an evolving technology and has both strengths and limitations.\n\nStrengths:"
