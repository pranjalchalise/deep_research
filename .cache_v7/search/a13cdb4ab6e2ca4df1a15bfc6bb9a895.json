      "snippet": "Robert Charles Sproul (/sproʊl/ SPROHL; February 13, 1939 – December 14, 2017) was an American Reformed theologian, Christian apologist, and ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America. He was the founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, and could be heard daily on the Renewing Your Mind radio broadcast internationally. [...] Working as a staunch defender of Protestantism, Sproul saw emerging modern technologies as an opportunity to disseminate teaching on Reformed theology. Faced with an increase in ecumenical activity between evangelical and Catholic figures in the 1990s, Sproul engaged in polemics to defend the evangelical doctrine of justification by faith alone. He has been described as \"the greatest and most influential proponent of the recovery of Reformed theology in the last century.\"\n\n## Education and personal life\n\n[edit] [...] Sproul was an advocate of Reformed theology in his many print, audio, and video publications, and advocated the Thomistic (classical) approaches to Christian apologetics, less common among Reformed apologists, most of whom prefer presuppositionalism.[citation needed] A dominant theme in his Renewing Your Mind lessons is the holiness and sovereignty of God. Sproul taught that headcovering should be practiced in churches as the ordinance is \"rooted and grounded in creation\"."

Sproul, a name synonymous with the resurgence of Reformed theology in modern Christianity, has left an indelible mark on countless lives through his teachings and writings. His journey began in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he was born into a family that valued education and faith. It was here that he first encountered the rich traditions of Christian doctrine. [...] Sproul's theological insights were profound yet accessible; he had a unique ability to distill complex ideas into relatable concepts for everyday believers. One key aspect of his teaching is the doctrine of total depravity—a concept rooted deeply in Reformed thought which asserts that humanity is fundamentally flawed due to original sin. He often emphasized how this understanding shapes our view of salvation and grace.\n\nIn his sermons and lectures, Sproul would illustrate these doctrines not just as abstract principles but as vital truths affecting our daily lives—encouraging listeners to grapple with their own spiritual state while pointing them toward Christ’s redemptive work. [...] His commitment to biblical authority resonated throughout his ministry at Ligonier Ministries, which he founded in 1971. Through conferences, publications like \"Tabletalk\" magazine, and educational resources such as the \"Renewing Your Mind\" radio program, Sproul reached millions worldwide—equipping them with knowledge grounded firmly in Scripture.\n\nBeyond academia and public speaking engagements lies another dimension of Sproul’s influence: mentorship. Many contemporary theologians cite him as a pivotal figure who shaped their understanding of faith during formative years—his warmth made learning feel less daunting."

      "snippet": "He was also a staunch Calvinist who affirmed Reformed theology long before there was a Young, Restless, and Reformed movement. His books such as The Holiness of God (1984), Chosen by God (1986), Grace Unknown (1997), and the New Geneva Study Bible (1995; later the Reformation Study Bible) contributed to the revival of Calvinism among evangelicals in the final two decades of the 20th century. [...] Sproul has placed an indelible mark on the evangelical movement. He made philosophy accessible and demonstrated the value of apologetics. He spread Reformed theology widely and reinforced the value of systematic theology and church history. He championed biblical inerrancy and defended the reformational view of justification in an era when both were hotly debated.\n\nHe was captivated by a vision of God’s holiness, which permeated his teaching and writing ministry. But what stands out most about Sproul is that the driving force behind all these efforts was a vision of theological education for everyday believers. Sproul believed that theology enables all Christians to think rightly about God and his world for the sake of living rightly before God in his world. [...] During his career, Sproul was near the center of the some of the most hotly contested debates among evangelicals. Some of these debates could be classified as family squabbles among conservative evangelicals. He advocated classical apologetics in contrast to presuppositionalism, which was popular with many Reformed theologians, and evidentialism, which was the more common view in the wider evangelical movement."

Sproul’s personal and public life and his unique contributions to theology and Christian living in the modern and postmodern world. [...] Nichols also reveals Sproul’s pivotal role in reintroducing Reformed theology with its focus on the glory of God to the Evangelical church. He did so by clearly articulating the five solas of the Reformation—sola Scriptura, sola fide, sola gratia, solus Christus, and soli Deo gloria—with passion and biblical conviction. As a champion of sola Scriptura, Sproul played a key role in establishing the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978) and served as the president of the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. As an advocate of sola fide and sola gratia, he stood against Evangelicals and Catholics Together (ECT) in 1994. While he believed they could be united on social issues, he saw their differences on the doctrine of justification as ultimately divisive. Similarly, he [...] In his final chapter entitled “Doxology,” Nichols discusses Sproul’s legacy, remarking, “Depending on when you looked in on R. C.’s life, you might have a different answer as to his contribution to the church and the Christian tradition” (p. 287). In 1978, he focused on the fight for inerrancy, whereas in 1994 and 2016, he championed justification by faith alone. Some remember him for work as a philosopher and others as an apologist and theologian. The author suggests all these emphases are appropriate, coming together in the title “Reformed classical theist” (p. 290). Overall, however, Sproul’s own words regarding the Reformers describe him: “an overwhelming, passionate, soul commitment to the transcendent majesty of God. That was the message that captivated me. That is what I have"

      "snippet": "Another one of Dr. Sproul’s massively important contributions has been his emphasis on the holiness of God and reverent worship. As was true of the time in which he emphasized the sovereignty of God, so many in the church have had wrong views of the absolute holiness of God. The Holiness of Godis on the list of most formative books of almost every minister I know in the Reformed church. Through this work, and other things that he has taught, Dr. Sproul has helped fuel a revival of interest in Reformed worship that captures a sense of the majesty and holiness of God. [...] Reply\n\n    Great tribute! I could say all the same things and more. Dr. Sproul has, without question, been the number one influence in my Christian life. I also believe he is the primary reason for the present-day resurgence in Reformed theology. He is practically the founder of New Calvinism.\n\n    The reason I say this is because he is the only one I know who teaches Reformed theology as such. Most other Reformed pastors and teachers became known for their Reformed doctrine either through Ligonier conferences, Ligonier resource materials, Renewing Your Mind, or Tabletalk magazine. God has truly blessed the church with this remarkable teacher and I hope he remains with us for many years to come.\n11. Enoch\n\n    Reply [...] Dr. Sproul has helped provide solid theological resources for the well-being of the church for over 40 years. Ligonier Ministries has introduced us to many–if not most–of the great theologians of our day. The National Conference has been a staple in the lives of a myriad of ministers and congregants alike for decades. Add to this the impact of the Reformation Study Bible, the many Reformation Trust volumes, Ligonier Academy, RefNet, the Ligonier blog and, of course, the celebrated Tabletalk Magazine. Furthermore, the way in which the lives of men and women have been impacted through Ligonier’s partnership with various prison ministries is immeasurable."

      "snippet": "The impact of R.C. Sproul on my life and ministry is owing to an incomparable combination of his unashamed allegiance to the absolute sovereignty and centrality of God, his total devotion to the inerrancy and radical relevance of the Christian Scriptures, his serious and rigorous attention to the actual text of Scripture in shaping his views, and his jolting formulations of biblical truth in relation to contemporary reality.\n\nChris Larson at Ligonier Ministries aptly describes R.C.’s character: [...] Sproul served as a board member for the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy, Evangelism Explosion, Prison Fellowship, and Serve International. In 1980, he became a professor of theology and apologetics at Reformed Theological Seminary, which opened its Orlando campus in 1987. He served there as the John Dyer Trimble Sr. Chair of Systematic Theology from 1987–1995. From 1995-2004, he served as the Distinguished Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics at Knox Theological Seminary in Fort Lauderdale. [...] R.C. Sproul was a theologian who served the church. He admired the Reformers not only for the content of their message, but for the way they took that message to the people. They were “battlefield theologians,” as he called them. Many first heard of the five solas of the Reformation through R.C. Sproul’s teaching. When R.C. taught about Martin Luther, it was as if he had met the sixteenth-century Reformer. R.C.’s commitment to sola Scriptura led him to play a key role in drafting and advocating for the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978). He also served as president of the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. Because of his commitment to sola fide, justification by faith alone, R.C. took a bold stand of opposition to Evangelicals and Catholics Together (ECT) in 1994. He"
