      "snippet": "Graves identified strongly with Claudius. In a 1969 interview for The Paris Review, he explained:\n\nI didn’t think I was writing a novel. I was trying to find out the truth about Claudius. And there was some strange confluent feeling between Claudius and myself. I found out that I was able to know a lot of things that happened without having any basis except that I knew that they were true.\n\nThe Claudius books were then an early example of what Graves later called the ‘analeptic method’, ‘the intuitive discovery of forgotten events by a deliberate suspension of time’. [...] Robert Graves, In Broken Images; Selected Correspondence ed. Paul O’Prey (New York: Moyer Bell, 1988), p. 242. Graves was also disparaging of the books as early as December 1933 in correspondence with T. E. Lawrence. See Martin Seymour-Smith, Robert Graves: His Life and Work (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1982), p. 256 (‘Claudius is only the most stupid side-activity’). [...] \\_\n\nRobert Graves began researching Claudius in 1929, but put aside the project shortly thereafter. He began writing I, Claudius in 1932 and the book was published in May 1934. Claudius the God followed just six months later. The narrative device is that the books are Claudius’s secret history of his life, written entirely by himself in Greek (not Latin). At the beginning, Claudius/Graves writes ‘in the present work, I swear by all the Gods, I am my own mere secretary, and my own official annalist’. In contrast, Graves himself did not work alone."

      "snippet": "Claudius was an unusual emperor, the first to be born outside Italy, in Roman Gaul. Under the Augustan Principate, new Caesars—who claimed direct lineage from the “divine” Augustus—were usually rubber-stamped by the toadyish Senate. However, the outsider Claudius (who had no political training and was prevented by his uncle Tiberius from entering the cursus honorum), was brought into power by the Roman Praetorian Guard, who wanted a change from the status quo apparat of the Augustan dynasty. [...] Later Roman historians, drawing on now lost contemporary accounts of Claudius, reflect the same prejudices. In the biography of Suetonius and throughout the Annals of the historian Tacitus, the accidental emperor Claudius comes off as little more than an impulsive bumbler, an accidental emperor who came to power on a fluke and whose lack of Julian elegance made him more a buffoon than the head of the global Roman Empire of some 60 million citizens.\n\nClaudius’s 50 years of private life before becoming emperor were also the stuff of court gossip and ridicule. He would marry four times and was often flattered and manipulated by younger women.\n\nModern historians, however, have corrected that largely negative view and ancient bias. [...] The Roman aristocracy—most claiming some sort of descent from Julius Caesar and his grandnephew Octavian (Caesar Augustus)—had long written Claudius off as a hopeless dolt. Claudius limped, the result of a childhood disease or genetic impairment. His mother Antonia, ashamed of his habits and appearance, called the youthful Claudius “a monster of man.” He was likely almost deaf and purportedly stuttered.\n\nThat lifelong disparagement of his appearance and mannerisms probably saved Claudius’s life in the dynastic struggles during the last years of the Emperor Augustus and the subsequent reigns of the emperors Tiberius and Caligula."

      "snippet": "until the Emperor Augustus, who was deified forty years earlier, swings the vote decisively against him. Claudius, one of his successors, has been such a monster, Augustus points out, that he shouldn’t be allowed to become a god. “He may look as if he couldn’t startle a fly, but he used to kill people as easily as a dog has a shit,” Augustus says. [...] overconfident estimation of his own artistic talents lasted until the very end. These words were not, however, as barbed as the ones that Seneca—referencing Vespasian’s “Blimey, I think I am becoming a god”—gave to the dying Claudius in the “Apocolocyntosis”: “Blimey, I think I’ve shat myself.” And, just in case his readers missed the point, Seneca goes on, “Whether he had or not, I don’t know—but he certainly made a shit of everything.” [...] It was an inside joke. Seneca was the tutor of Nero, who was Claudius’ successor and his stepson. The idea is that the befuddled old Emperor—who was rumored to have been finished off with some poisoned mushrooms by his wife, Agrippina—is not really fit to be divine. As Claudius climbs up Mt. Olympus, word comes to the “real” gods that a stranger has arrived, and that he is muttering incomprehensibly. But, when Hercules is sent to investigate, the two of them swap a few lines of Homer’s poetry. (“Thank goodness there are some scholars in Heaven,” Claudius enthuses.) The gods meet in private to decide whether to allow Claudius to join their ranks. “Opinions were mixed, but were coming down generally in Claudius’ favor,” Seneca writes, until the Emperor Augustus, who was deified forty years"

      "snippet": "speak freely on the civil wars toward the end of the Roman Republic, he began a history of Rome with the principate of Augustus. He composed 20 books of Etruscan and 8 books of Carthaginian history, all in Greek; an autobiography; and a historical treatise on the Roman alphabet with suggestions for orthographical reform—which as emperor he later tried not very successfully to implement. He also wrote on dice playing, of which he was fond. All his works are lost, and their importance cannot be measured. The Etruscan history may have had original material: his first wife, Plautia Urgulanilla, had Etruscan blood, and her family was probably able to put Claudius in touch with authentic Etruscan traditions. After divorcing Urgulanilla, he in turn married Aelia Paetina, Valeria Messalina, who [...] Claudius’s decision to invade Britain (43) and his personal appearance at the climax of the expedition, the crossing of the Thames and the capture of Camulodunum (Colchester), were prompted by his need of popularity and glory. But concern with the anti-Roman influence of the Druid priesthood, which he tried to suppress in Gaul, and a general inclination toward expanding the frontiers were other reasons. Claudius planted a colony of veterans at Camulodunum and established client-kingdoms to protect the frontiers of the province; these were afterward a source of trouble, such as the revolt in 47 of Prasutagus, client-king of the Iceni, and later the general revolt instigated by his wife Boudicca (also called Boadicea). He also annexed Mauretania (41–42) in North Africa, of which he made two [...] he asked Jews and non-Jews “to stop this destructive and obstinate mutual enmity.” Although personally disinclined to accept divine honours, he did not seriously oppose the current trend and had a temple erected to himself in Camulodunum. His public works include the reorganization of the grain supply of Rome and construction of a new harbour at Ostia, which was later improved by the emperor Trajan."
