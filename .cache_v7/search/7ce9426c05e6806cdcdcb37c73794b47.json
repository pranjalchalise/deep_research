      "snippet": "The discography of Pierce the Veil, an American post-hardcore band formed in San Diego in 2006, comprises five studio albums, fifteen singles, and nineteen music videos, spanning from their debut in 2007 to ongoing releases as of 2025. The band's early work, released through Equal Vision Records, includes the debut studio album A Flair for the Dramatic (2007), which featured raw energy that garnered attention in the underground scene. This was followed by Selfish Machines (2010), which included the breakout single \"King for a Day\" featuring Kellin Quinn and propelled the band toward mainstream recognition with its theatrical lyrics and dynamic instrumentation. Signing to Fearless Records in 2012 elevated their profile, beginning with Collide with the Sky, which debuted at number one on [...] 2025. Beyond albums, Pierce the Veil's singles discography highlights their collaborative spirit and chart success, including \"Karma Police\" (2024), a Radiohead cover that reached number 27 on the Alternative Airplay chart, and the 2025 single \"So Far So Fake,\" which topped the same chart. Their music videos, often cinematic and narrative-driven, number nineteen and have amassed hundreds of millions of views, contributing to their enduring fanbase in the post-hardcore community.

It laid the foundation for their fanbase through grassroots touring, though it achieved modest chart entry limited to the Heatseekers ranking. Selfish Machines followed under producer Mike Green at The Green Room in Los Angeles, introducing more melodic elements and themes of personal turmoil; the 2013 reissue featured remixing by Dan Korneff for enhanced clarity, aligning it with the band's maturing production style. Lead single \"Bulletproof Love\" from this album helped propel its Heatseekers chart-topping debut. Collide with the Sky, also produced by Dan Korneff, represented a commercial pivot"
