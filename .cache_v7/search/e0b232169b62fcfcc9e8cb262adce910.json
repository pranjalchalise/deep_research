Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad(2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] ## Shreeansh Agrawal\n\n  Shreeansh double majored in Mathematics and Art History at Amherst College and constantly has one foot in each boat.

Special thanks to Jared Friedman & Diana Hu, whom I first met while interviewing for the HackMIT 2023 YC Startup Pitch Challenge. I’m especially grateful for their outreach and support in encouraging me to submit prioritized referrals—because of that, I got to attend with Tina Zhang, Tairan (Ryan) Ji, and Liam Davis, bringing a small but proud Amherst College presence to this global stage. It was also a full-circle moment running into Ahmed A., an Amherst alum and my very first pre-orientation leader. Above all, I’m walking away inspired—by the conversations, the community’s generosity, and the collective energy to keep building. If we met at AI Startup School or at the after-parties,"
