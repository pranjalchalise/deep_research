From Wall Street to academia, from the Baltimore public schools to the hospital floor, Deb has navigated big career pivots with intentionality. Now a nurse specializing in wound care and infusion therapy, she brings to her patients the same attentiveness she has offered students, colleagues, and friends: an ability to read people gently, listen deeply, and act thoughtfully. The conversation explores how her gift for quiet perception, honed at Amherst through the close reading of texts and refined through her study of literature, theology, and now medicine, has shaped her approach to work, family, and community. Her story is one of continuous [...] 53 min\n\nSee All (75)\n\n## Ratings & Reviews\n\n5\n\nout of 5\n\n11 Ratings\n\n ### Inspiring real-life stories\n\n  11/21/2019\n\n  KS1006\n\n  Super impressed to hear stories about heroes that you haven’t heard about.

      "snippet": "1\n\nMaureen Hamburger\n\n2 years ago\n\nThe Moth, Modern Love, Terrible Thanks for Asking, This is Love, Strangers, Criminal, Family Secrets.\n\n1\n\nN.\n\n2 years ago\n\nOoh thank you! I’ve been meaning to get more into podcasts and will devour this list.  \n Two recommendations:\n\n Believe in Magic: Similar to Scamanda. Tells the story of a mom who faked her daughter’s brain tumor. They eventually start an organization that One Direction ends up promoting.\n Sold a Story: This is a must listen for anyone who teaches elementary or even middle school. I’d also highly recommend it to parents (and other family members) whose children had difficulty learning to read. It provides an in-depth into how and why reading instruction evolved into what it is today and the negative ramifications.\n\n3\n\nMiruska [...] Root of Evil: The history of the Black Dahlia murderer, as told by his relatives, who are younger journalists. This was fairly disturbing at times, but my goodness, it was excellent, and I couldn’t stop listening. They deep dive hard, and even after they prove the murderer, there is a follow-up episode that offers some hope and redemption re inherited trauma/abuse.\n\nYour Own Backyard: This was a huge story when I was in college, so I was genuinely curious who did it. This podcast was so well researched with intrepid and relentless journalism that it actually helped bring justice. So good. [...] 60 Songs that Explain the 90s was so popular the host added more episodes. I laugh out loud so much and will be devastated when it’s over. Hopefully they will move onto other decades but I am a similar age to the host (and Emily) so the 90s was my adolescence and the music memories run deep! I listen on Spotify. I also love WTF with Mark Maron. I’m not sure why I find him so soothing. His emotional intelligence and self reflection impressed me. Cat angels everywhere. I search for podcasts based on my TV watching. Pamela Adlon and Better Things, Kate & Leisha from The L Word, and I have listened to two entire podcasts about The Sopranos. I live in the Bay Area and there are great local shows that folks anywhere can enjoy: Ear Hustle (about life in prison), Home Cooking (I want Samin Nosrat"
