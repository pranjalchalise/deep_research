      "snippet": "Three-quarters of Republicans call each man a very successful business person. Democrats have very little good to say about either man, though 39% say Musk is a very successful business person. At least half say each of Musk and Trump is a disruptor, which could be meant as a compliment.\n\nEven now, Republicans are much more likely than the public overall to want Musk to have at least a little influence on the Trump administration, and most Republicans and Democrats believe he does have influence. Democrats are much more likely to say Musk has a lot of influence; most don’t want him to have as much influence as they perceive he does. A majority of Republicans believe Musk has a little influence and most agree that’s the amount he should have.\n\n## What about a new party? [...] Methodology: This article includes results from an online survey conducted July 2 - 7, 2025 among 1,134 U.S. adult citizens. Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of adult U.S. citizens. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2024 presidential vote, 2020 election turnout and presidential vote, baseline party identification, and current voter registration status. 2024 presidential vote, at time of weighting, was estimated to be 48% Harris and 50% Trump. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Baseline party identification is the respondent’s most recent answer given around November 8, 2024, and is weighted to the estimated distribution at that time (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). The [...] However, Musk does rate more highly than Trump on several characteristics, even among Republicans. More Republicans see Musk as possessing intelligence that is far above average (53%) than say the same about Trump (42%). At least about half call Musk each of the following: an entrepreneur (64%), an innovator, (52%), and an inventor (52%). The percentages of Republicans who would use each of those words about Trump are lower: 57%, 29%, and 9%."

      "snippet": "Raymond La Raja, professor of political science at UMass Amherst and co-director of the poll, explains that this latest survey points to a growing distrust of billionaires’ impact on government.\n\n“Most Americans – 56% – think billionaires threaten democracy, and that view doesn’t waver by income level,” La Raja says. “Trump voters are less likely to perceive a threat, which is at odds with the populist impulses of many of these voters. Nonetheless, more than 1 in 4 Trump voters (27%) agree that billionaires are a threat, despite the fact that Musk, one of the world’s richest men, is linked closely to the president.” [...] “In recent weeks, President Trump has hinted that Elon Musk’s time in the White House may be drawing to a close,” Nteta says. “In the wake of Musk’s failed attempt to elect a conservative judge in Wisconsin, his opposition to Trump’s tariff policies, and the controversies associated with his leadership of DOGE, Trump may believe that Musk, by far the largest donor to his campaign, has become more of a political liability than an asset. The results of our recent poll suggest that this indeed may be the case. When asked to indicate how they feel about Musk on a scale of 0 (coldest) to 100 (warmest), we find that ratings of Musk have dropped from an average of 42 in October of 2024 to 37 today. We additionally asked Americans to describe Musk in one word, and while the word ‘smart’ was most [...] “Only three months into his tenure at DOGE, questions concerning Musk’s conflict of interests, his legal authority to cut federal programs, and the actual budgetary savings that DOGE has elicited continue to swirl,” says Tatishe Nteta, provost professor of political science at UMass Amherst and director of the poll. “Our results suggest that these controversies may have had a negative effect on the public’s view of Musk, as majorities of Americans do not trust him to identify federal programs to cut (53%), protect the private information of citizens (55%), or to avoid using his position to benefit his business interests (59%). Additionally, a majority of Americans (56%) believe that Musk has too much influence over the federal government. Given the unpopularity of Musk’s efforts to rein"

Relatedly, a majority of those polled expressed concerns about Musk regarding the following actions:\n\n“It is clear, the voters are concerned about an unelected billionaire — Elon Musk — playing shadow president,” said Virginia Kase Solomón, President and CEO of Common Cause. “In fact, a near majority are ready for Elon to be fired. It’s time for the President and Congress to listen to the people, rein in DOGE, and fire Elon Musk.”\n\nOther highlights from the poll:\n\nYou can view these poll numbers in graphic form here.

More than 199,434 people nationally have signed onto Common Cause’s Fire Musk Petition, and a coalition of 10 diverse advocacy groups sent a letter to the White House demanding Musk’s removal."
