      "snippet": "## Personality[]\n\nMarius is an exceptionally sagacious, wise and optimistic vampire. He loves to read and to write, and sees himself as a historian and a continual observer of the history of the human race. Marius's interests include all manner of intellectual and artistic pursuits, including filmmaking, writing, and most notably, painting. Marius is obsessed with the art created by humans, but is distraught by his inability to create art that is not somewhat unnatural due to his vampiric nature. Marius is frequently torn between his desire to live among humans and the limitations of his ability to do so. Despite his age, he prefers to move and act like a human in situations where he could otherwise use his vampiric powers. [...] Marius was a scholar and chronicler by the age of twenty, traveling quite a lot and visiting all the great European cities. When he is twenty-five, he meets a ten year old girl named Lydia at the home of her father, a Roman senator, and is impressed by her interest in poetry. Marius asks to become betrothed to Lydia, with the intention that it will delay his own obligation to get married until she is of marriageable age. He is denied by her father, who explains to Lydia that this is the reason he was rejected. Lydia encounters Marius once more at a religious festival when she is fifteen, and informs him that she asked her father to allow them to get married, but was denied again due to Marius's lower social status. [...] Marius de Romanus is an ancient vampire of Roman origin first introduced in The Vampire Lestat. Transformed into a vampire near beginning of the first century, he becomes the guardian of Those Who Must Be Kept for nearly two thousand years. Marius plays an important role in the timeline of The Vampire Chronicles, as he is viewed by Lestat as a mentor figure, is Armand's and Pandora's maker, and is the central figure of his own autobiography, Blood and Gold.\n\n## Contents\n\n 1 Physical Appearance\n 2 Personality\n 3 Biography\n  + 3.1 Early Life\n  + 3.2 Life As a Vampire\n 4 In Adaptations\n 5 Gallery\n\n## Physical Appearance[]"

He is a young student, and the suitor of Cosette. Believing Cosette lost to him, and determined to die, he joins the revolutionary association Friends of the ABC, which he associates with, but is not a part of, as they take part in the 1832 June Rebellion.

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the distinguished and inordinately conceited Caecilii Metelli, then at the height of their political power. They backed his candidacy for tribune (defender) of the plebs (common people) in 119. As tribune, Marius proposed a bill affecting procedure in elections and legislative assemblies by narrowing the bridges—the gangway across which each voter passed to fill in and deposit his ballot tablet—as a result of which there was no longer room on the gangway for observers, normally aristocrats, who abused their position to influence an individual’s vote. When the two consuls tried to persuade the Senate to block the bill, Marius threatened them with imprisonment, and the bill was carried."

      "snippet": "After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate [...] In the next campaigning year, Marius is listed as one of the senior legates of the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus \"Publius Rutilius Lupus (consul)\"), who was perhaps one of his relatives. Lupus fell to a Marsic ambush on 11 June 90 BC while crossing the river Tolenus; Marius, commanding a different wing of the army, was yet able to drive the enemy back with heavy losses. The senate, after Lupus' death, appointed Marius in joint command with the praetor Quintus Servilius Caepio \"Quintus Servilius Caepio (quaestor 103 BC)\"); Caepio, however, quickly fell to a Marsic act of perfidy, leaving Marius in sole command. After taking command over the northern front of the war, Marius moved energetically forward, defeating the Marsi with his former legate Sulla's help on hilly ground south of the [...] After Sulla left Rome to prepare for his army in Nola to depart for the east, Sulpicius had his measures passed into law, and tacked on a rider which unprecedentedly appointed Marius – now a private citizen lacking any office in the Republic – to the command in Pontus. Marius then sent two of his legates to take the command from Sulla. These moves were foolish: Evans notes \"Marius's political ingenuity seems to have deserted him\" and calls his actions rash. Sulla refused to relinquish his post, even though all but one of his own subordinates opposed Sulla's course of action. After killing Marius's legates, Sulla rallied his troops to his personal banner and called upon them to defend him against the insults of the Marian faction. The ancient sources say that Sulla's soldiers pledged their"

      "snippet": "Research Starters Home\n\nEBSCO Knowledge Advantage TM\n\n# Gaius Marius Creates a Private Army\n\nGaius Marius, a significant figure in Roman military history, transformed the Roman army from a citizen militia into a professional force during the late second century BCE. This transformation was necessitated by the demands of Rome's expanding empire, which required larger, longer-serving armies. Traditional recruitment methods, reliant on property ownership, became increasingly strained as small landholders struggled to balance farming and military service, particularly with the influx of cheap grain from conquered territories that undermined their livelihoods. [...] ## Key Figures\n\n Gaius Marius (157-86 b.c.e.), commoner who gained high civilian status through military achievements\n\n## Summary of Event\n\nMarius’s reforms of the Roman army were the culmination of developments arising out of Rome’s emergence as an imperial power. These reforms marked the beginning of developments that led to the civil wars of the late first century and the end of the Roman Republic. [...] The reforms of Tiberius and Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, designed to reestablish the small farmer class, failed to achieve their purpose while creating a climate of mutual suspicion and hostility between the ruling senatorial order and the rest of the Roman population. When Gaius Marius, an experienced soldier unconnected with the senatorial order, offered to remove the conduct of the Jugurthine War (111-105 b.c.e.) from the hands of the senate-appointed generals, he was elected to office by a large popular majority. Furthermore, over the objections of the senate, Marius was entrusted with the African campaign. Seeing the difficulties of raising an army in the traditional way, and less bound by tradition than generals of higher birth, Marius refused to order a conscription. Instead, he"

Perhaps, too, he was afraid of the soldiers, who were drawn up and ready, in case Catulus were deprived of his honour, to prevent Marius also from celebrating a triumph. [...] house, now to the nobles and now to Saturninus, trying to irritate and bring them into collision. 3 However, when the senate and the knights began to combine and give utterance to their indignation, he led his soldiers into the forum, forced the insurgents to take refuge on the Capitol, and compelled them to surrender for lack of water. For he cut off the water-conduits; whereupon they gave up the struggle, called Marius, and surrendered themselves on what was called the public faith. 4 Marius did all he could to save the men, but it was of no avail, and when they came down into the forum they were put to death. This affair made Marius obnoxious alike to the nobles and to the people, and when the time for electing censors came he did not present himself as a candidate, although everyone [...] 5 This was the first seed of that bitter and incurable hatred between Marius and Sulla, which nearly brought Rome to ruin. For many wished Sulla to have the glory of the affair because they hated Marius, and Sulla himself had a seal-ring made, which he used to wear, on which was engraved the surrender of Jugurtha to him by Bocchus. 6 By constantly using this ring Sulla provoked Marius, who was an ambitious man, loath to share his glory with another, and quarrelsome. And the enemies of Marius gave Sulla most encouragement, by attributing the first and greatest successes of the war to Metellus, but the last, and the termination of it, to Sulla, so that the people might cease admiring Marius and giving him their chief allegiance."
