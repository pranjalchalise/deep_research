Though as a mature performer he made only a handful of films between 1971 and 1973, his graceful yet lethal screen presence was so magnetic - and such a source of pride for Asian audiences - that his influence continued to shine decades after his sudden and mysterious death in 1973.\n\n## Highest-Rated Movies\n\n## Photos\n\n### Bruce Lee\n\n## Filmography\n\n## News & Interviews for Bruce Lee [...] Guides\n\nThe 160 Best Black Movies of the 21st Century\n\n71 Movies That Celebrate Black Joy\n\nHubs\n\nWhat to Watch: In Theaters and On Streaming\n\nAwards Tour\n\nRT News\n\nOscars 2026: Where to Watch the Nominees\n\nYour Full List of All Upcoming Marvel Movies and TV Shows — With Key Details!\n\n# Bruce Lee\n\nHighest Rated:\n\n88%\nEnter the Dragon (1973)\n\nLowest Rated:\n\n38%\nGame of Death (1979)\n\nBirthday:\nNov 27, 1940\n\nBirthplace:\nSan Francisco, California, USA [...] ## Filmography\n\n## News & Interviews for Bruce Lee\n\nBruce Lee vs. Jackie Chan vs. Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen\n\n10 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This October\n\nSteve McQueen Returning to the Big Screen (Sort Of)\n\nView All\n\n Join the Newsletter\n\nGet the freshest reviews, news, and more delivered right to your inbox!\n\nFollow Us\n\nCopyright © Fandango.
