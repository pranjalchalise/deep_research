Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative.

Learning hard skills, soft skills, and diversity have all had a significant impact on my way of seeing things. Everyone in the Incubate Nepal Family is so welcoming and full of life experiences. My mentor, Anamika didi, and my teammates have been so supportive that they have always made time to sit down and teach me in a variety of ways, whether in research or in life.
