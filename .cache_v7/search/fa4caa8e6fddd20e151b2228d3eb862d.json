[i], [u] and [a] are the most stable vowels and show the nature of the quantal vowels. Relatively [e] and [o] are stable but not as stable as the previous three. In comparison, [e] is more stable than [o].Of all, [ə]is the most unstable vowel and it fluctuates in the wide area of central-back and mid-low regions.

In Dandagaun, it is spoken in day-to-day conversation in a very limited number of domains of language use.In 2007 there were 51 speakers and 44 terminal-speakers, and 34 rememberers. Most of the speakers were very senior in age and their number is decreasing. Six of the speakers passed away within the period of 3 years (Kansakar et al. 2011a). The cognate comparison shows that the closest genetic affiliation of the Baram language is with Thami, second closest language is Chepang and Newar and Magar are close to it, too (Chalise 2015).
