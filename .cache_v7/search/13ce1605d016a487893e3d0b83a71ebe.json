It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable users to create, run and optimize large language models (LLMs) in a scalable and efficient manner. At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow. [...] LangGraph workflow\n\nLangGraph illuminates the processes within an AI workflow, allowing full transparency of the agent’s state. Within LangGraph, the “state” feature serves as a memory bank that records and tracks all the valuable information processed by the AI system. It’s similar to a digital notebook where the system captures and updates data as it moves through various stages of a workflow or graph analysis. [...] Agent systems: LangGraph provides a framework for building agent-based systems, which can be used in applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles or video games.\n\nLLM applications: By using LangGraph’s capabilities, developers can build more sophisticated AI models that learn and improve over time. Norwegian Cruise Line uses LangGraph to compile, construct and refine guest-facing AI solutions. This capability allows for improved and personalized guest experiences.\n\n## LLM integration in LangGraph"

      "snippet": "## What is LangGraph?\n\nLangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain, designed to add cyclic computational capabilities to your LLM applications. While LangChain allows you to define chains of computation (Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs), LangGraph introduces the ability to add cycles, enabling more complex, agent-like behaviors where you can call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next.\n\n## Key Concepts [...] Sitemap\n\nOpen in app\n\nSign in\n\nWrite\n\nSearch\n\nSign in\n\n# Introduction to LangGraph: A Beginner’s Guide\n\nCPlog\n\n3 min read\n\n·\n\nFeb 15, 2024\n\n--\n\nLangGraph is a powerful tool for building stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It extends the LangChain library, allowing you to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner. In this article, we’ll introduce LangGraph, walk you through its basic concepts, and share some insights and common points of confusion for beginners.\n\n## What is LangGraph? [...] ## Key Concepts\n\n Stateful Graph: LangGraph revolves around the concept of a stateful graph, where each node in the graph represents a step in your computation, and the graph maintains a state that is passed around and updated as the computation progresses.\n Nodes: Nodes are the building blocks of your LangGraph. Each node represents a function or a computation step. You define nodes to perform specific tasks, such as processing input, making decisions, or interacting with external APIs.\n Edges: Edges connect the nodes in your graph, defining the flow of computation. LangGraph supports conditional edges, allowing you to dynamically determine the next node to execute based on the current state of the graph.\n\n## A Simple Example"

It's exciting, but it comes with challenges: managing the state of various agents, coordinating their interactions, and handling errors effectively. This is where LangGraph can help.\n\nLangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to tackle these challenges head-on. LangGraph provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner. [...] ### Chatbots\n\nLangGraph is ideal for developing sophisticated chatbots that can handle a wide array of user requests. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, these chatbots can process natural language queries, provide accurate responses, and seamlessly switch between different conversation topics. The ability to manage state and coordinate interactions ensures that the chatbot maintains context and delivers a coherent user experience.\n\n### Autonomous agents\n\nFor applications requiring autonomous decision-making, LangGraph enables the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic. [...] It simplifies the development process by enabling the creation of cyclical graphs, which are essential for developing agent runtimes. With LangGraph, we can easily build robust, scalable, and flexible multi-agent systems.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this introduction to LangChain. You can also check out our LangGraph video tutorial below.\n\n## What Is LangGraph?\n\nLangGraph enables us to create stateful, multi-actor applications utilizing LLMs as easily as possible. It extends the capabilities of LangChain, introducing the ability to create and manage cyclical graphs, which are pivotal for developing sophisticated agent runtimes. The core concepts of LangGraph include: graph structure, state management, and coordination.\n\n### Graph structure"

      "snippet": "## LangGraph: Stateful, Nonlinear Workflows\n\nLangGraph, on the other hand, is designed for more complex, stateful workflows. It’s a specialized library within the LangChain ecosystem, tailored for building multi-agent systems that handle nonlinear processes.\n\nConsider a task management assistant. The workflow here isn’t linear. It involves processing user input, adding tasks, completing tasks, and summarizing tasks. LangGraph models this as a graph structure, where each action is a node and the transitions between actions are edges. [...] While LangChain focuses on chaining LLM operations in a specific sequence, LangGraph is primarily designed for creating stateful, multi-agent systems. It allows for the development of workflows that are more dynamic and interactive than traditional LangChain applications, by focusing on building graph-based systems.\n\n### 4. What does a “graph structure” mean in the context of LangGraph?\n\nIn LangGraph, the graph structure refers to a network of nodes (representing actions) connected by edges (representing transitions between actions). This setup allows for loops and the ability to revisit previous states, meaning the system can handle diverse inputs and navigate through the workflow in a flexible way that isn’t as easy with a linear chain. [...] But if you’re building something more complex — like a virtual assistant or a system that needs to handle multiple, interdependent tasks — LangGraph is the way to go. Its graph structure and robust state management make it perfect for applications that require flexibility and context awareness.\n\nBoth frameworks are powerful tools for building LLM applications. The key is to understand the strengths of each and choose the one that best fits your needs. Whether you’re chaining operations or navigating complex workflows, LangChain and LangGraph give you the tools to build something great.\n\nTraditional cybersecurity methods aren’t enough. Models can be poisoned, stolen, or tricked in ways traditional software can’t. If you’re building AI, you need a new approach.\n\n## Further Reading::"
