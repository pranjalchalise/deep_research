Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy.

Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] ## Surya Tripathi\n\n  Surya grew up as a farmer in the beautiful village of Hemja in Pokhara.

After taking a gap year, he got into MIT as a bioengineering major. where he developed a passion in microbiology and preventive medicine. Surya has numerous publications in Nature and Cell in these topics. Currently, he is a PhD student at UC Berkeley, and aside from research, loves mentoring and helping students.\n Organizer\n\n  ## Simanta Gautam"

      "title": "Enhancing autonomous systems with bayesian neural ...",
      "snippet": "### 2.2 Bayesian neural networks and uncertainty modeling\n\nBNNs extend standard neural networks by treating weights as probability distributions rather than fixed parameters. This allows the model to capture both epistemic (model-related) and aleatoric (input-related) uncertainty (Kendall and Gal, 2017). Methods such as variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout enable practical approximations for training and inference (Mena et al., 2021).\n\nBNNs have been applied successfully in healthcare (Ngartera et al., 2024), object tracking (Nie et al., 2018), and risk-sensitive control. However, most implementations focus on static perception tasks. The application of BNNs in full-stack autonomous navigation–particularly for planning and trajectory prediction–remains underexplored. [...] The rapid evolution of autonomous systems is reshaping urban mobility and accelerating the development of intelligent transportation networks. A key challenge in real-world deployment is the ability to operate reliably under uncertainty–arising from sensor noise, dynamic agents, and adverse weather conditions. This paper investigates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) as a principled framework for uncertainty-aware decision-making in autonomous navigation. Through three representative case studies–urban navigation, obstacle avoidance, and weather-induced visual degradation–we demonstrate how BNNs outperform deterministic neural networks by providing calibrated predictions and uncertainty estimates. These probabilistic outputs enable conservative and interpretable decision-making in high-risk [...] • Performance Gains: BNNs achieved an 18.3% reduction in mean path deviation under high-uncertainty scenarios.\n\n### 4.5 Quantitative error comparison across scenarios\n\nWe further evaluated performance across four urban contexts: open roads, intersections, occluded turns, and fog conditions. BNNs consistently showed lower deviation from ground truth, particularly under sensory or environmental uncertainty.\n\n### 4.6 Discussion and conclusion\n\nThis case study validates the advantage of modeling uncertainty in urban navigation. BNNs offer better calibration, interpretability, and safety margins than deterministic counterparts.\n\n#### 4.6.1 Limitations\n\nTrade-offs include:\n\n• Inference Time: Sampling increases computation."

      "snippet": "Abstracts Presented at the Annual Meeting of Indian Foot and Ankle Society (IFASCON 2019) at New Delhi, 2019 Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (Asia-Pacific), Volume 6 Issue 2 (July–December 2019) 61 They were graded on basis of residual pain, foot shape, and movements. Best results were seen in cases where rigid intertarsal/intercolumnar stability was achieved by screw fixation. There was residual inter-cuneiform subluxation in 4 cases, which were fixed with K-wires, and this led to residual pain. Conservative/neglected cases had poor results. Intercolumnar/intertarsal instabilities should be primarily recognized and stabilized under compression. Stabilization should not only be within the 3 columns but also intercolumnar, thus maintaining the relative length of three columns and hence [...] 12 months postoperatively. At 12 months, the mean AOFAS was 84.24. Five patients (20%) had score more then 90 (excellent), 11 (44%) had score between 81–90 (good), 8 (32%) had score between 71–80 (fair) and 1 (4%) had 70 (poor). Mean AOFAS score improved from 71.36 (at 3 month) to 79.96 (at 6 month) and 84.24 (at 1 year). Mean VAS score at the end of 1 year was 22.4 mm. 17(68%) cases in the study had fracture union without any complications.8 (32%) cases had postoperative complications ranging from superficial wound infection to delayed union and secondary arthrosis. Tibia pilon fractures are challanging injuries. A constant balance has to be maintained to get anatomical reduction with minimal soft tissue handling. In a closed and type one open fracture low profile LCP is best option. [...] of our study is to evaluate restoration of subtalar joint and functional outcomes in intrarticular displaced sanders type 2 and 3 calcaneal fractures treated with a minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach for posterior facet exposure and percutaneous screw and/or plate."
