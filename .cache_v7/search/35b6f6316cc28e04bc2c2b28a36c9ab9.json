A guy who’s been wrestling and boxing for a year can beat a martial artist who’s been training for 15 years. That pissed a lot of people off,” says Brazilian Jiu Jitsu prodigy, Eddie Bravo, founder of 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu.\n\nTo say that Bruce Lee was ahead of his time both philosophically and physically would be an understatement.\n\n## TOP NEWS\n\nUFC 325: Volkanovski v Lopes 2 [...] During a famous interview on The Pierre Berton Show in December of 1971, Lee said, “Actually I do not, you know, teach karate, because I do not believe in style. If you do not have style, you can just say, here I am, you know, as a human being. How can I express myself, totally and completely?”\n\nIn his quest for the ultimate expression of one's self, Lee created Jeet Kune Do, a philosophy more than a style of fighting, which means way of the intercepting fist.\n\nAccording to Canadian martial artist and fight analyst, Paul Lazenby, Jeet Kune Do is “…the attitude that you build your own style using whatever works for you. That very thought right there is the cornerstone of modern Mixed Martial Arts.” [...] ## TOP NEWS\n\nUFC 325: Volkanovski v Lopes 2\n\n### Alexander Volkanovski and the Winners, Losers and Results from UFC 325\n\nUFC 325: Volkanovski v Lopes 2\n\n### Alexander Volkanovski, Diego Lopes' Next Best Fights After UFC 325 Results\n\nUFC 325: Volkanovski v Lopes 2\n\n### Alexander Volkanovski Beats Diego Lopes By UD at UFC 325 to Retain Featherweight Title\n\nLee was an actor, but above all he was an artist and a martial artist, who took every opportunity to express himself and bring his way of no way to the public eye during the short time he was alive. In doing so, Lee changed the way people think, fight, and live forever."

      "snippet": "Lee’s breakthrough movie for American audiences, Enter the Dragon, was released fifty years ago, just after his death at the age of 32. The film unleashed a wave of interest in martial arts across the country. One that swept me up all those years ago and continues to sweep up kids today, even if they don’t recognize what is happening.\n\nIt’s not that Bruce Lee is forgotten. Rather, I believe, it’s that his influence is so great, so encompassing, that it’s become harder and harder to see.\n\nWhat my kids and others may not realize is that Lee’s mixing of martial arts styles, his passion for the “emotional content” of martial arts, and his influence are present in fashion, video games, sports, film, and the culture all around them. [...] From superheroes like Marvel’s Shang-Chi to video game characters like Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat to the fight scenes in Everything Everywhere All at Once to the confidence and swagger of the Wu-Tang Clan, even in your everyday athleisure brands, shades of Bruce Lee are there if you know where to look. To play on his phrase, he’s become like water and we’re swimming it.\n\nEnter the Dragon was a huge success in 1973. The movie is iconic. It sets up the hallmarks of martial arts films. To modern audiences, they might seem like tropes, but Lee was the archetype. The film follows Lee as he goes undercover seeking revenge for an attack on his sister by the goons of the evil crime boss Han, who organizes deadly martial arts tournaments on his private island. [...] Along the way, Lee uses his lightning-fast speed and crisp, targeted attacks to best his adversaries. It’s worth mentioning that in his first confrontation in the film, Lee, a practitioner of his own hybrid martial arts style called Jeet Kune Do, finishes the fight with an arm bar, a common submission in MMA that you’ll see in almost any UFC match today. Back then, most martial artists were focused on one discipline, but Lee cross-trained many striking and grappling styles. It goes to show how ahead of his time Lee was in regards to incorporating what he found useful in other martial arts."

      "snippet": "admin\n\nIn the realm of martial arts, few names resonate as powerfully as Bruce Lee. An icon, a philosopher, and a revolutionary martial artist, Bruce Lee’s legacy and influence extends far beyond his films and into the very heart of self-defense. His creation, Jeet Kune Do (JKD), stands as a testament to his relentless pursuit of martial effectiveness and efficiency. Often referred to from Bruce Lee as “scientific street fighting”, Jeet Kune Do is not just a martial art—it’s a philosophy, a way of life, and an evolving approach to real world combat that continues to inspire martial artists around the world.\n\n## Bruce Lee’s Martial Arts Journey [...] ## Bruce Lee’s Martial Arts Journey\n\nBruce Lee’s journey in martial arts began at an early age, training in Wing Chun under the legendary Ip Man in Hong Kong. This experience laid the foundation for Lee’s martial arts philosophy, focusing on directness, simplicity, and efficiency. However, as Lee continued to evolve as a martial artist, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the limitations he perceived in traditional martial arts.\n\nIn the early 1960s, after moving to the United States, Lee began to explore various martial arts styles, including boxing, fencing, and grappling. His extensive research and experimentation led him to the realization that no single martial art could fully address the complexities of real-world combat. This epiphany sparked the birth of Jeet Kune Do. [...] ## Bruce Lee’s Legacy of Jeet Kune Do\n\nToday, Jeet Kune Do continues to be a beacon of innovation. Bruce Lee’s vision of “scientific street fighting” has inspired countless martial artists to break free from the confines of tradition and embrace a more holistic, adaptable approach to martial arts. Through Jeet Kune Do, Bruce Lee’s legacy lives on, empowering individuals to protect themselves and others with skill, intelligence, and adaptability while simultaneously opening the door to ones own path to personal liberation.\n\n## Conclusion"

Bruce's martial journey, of almost 20 years, begins at age 13, with him learning the Chinese art of Wing Chun Gung-Fu and ends with the development of his own art of Jeet Kune Do.\n\n1953 - Begins studying Wing Chun with Yip Man. (1953)Bruce Lee Foundation\n\nHong Kong [...] In 1958, Bruce found himself in a High School boxing tournament. He won. This was a significant feather in Bruce's cap as a Wing Chun student, because he could only use his punches. These early experiences in both fencing and boxing fueled Bruce's curiosity and helped shaped his abilities to evaluate and adapt the most effective methods from other arts, to his own. Bruce is not in this photo, taken at that same tournament, but one can only imagine.\n\nBruce with JFGFI Seattle students.

However, his interest in other Chinese martial arts, as well as Boxing and Judo, grew steadily in Seattle, and he began experimenting with many training routines from these systems. He was known to be extremely fast with his hands; almost invincible.\n\nBruce Lee training with a Wooden Dummy by Bruce LeeBruce Lee Foundation\n\nBruce, pictured here, training with a wooden dummy.\n\nBruce Lee and the Oakland Crew (1964/1966) by Bruce LeeBruce Lee Foundation\n\nOakland"
