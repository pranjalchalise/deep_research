      "snippet": "he asked Jews and non-Jews “to stop this destructive and obstinate mutual enmity.” Although personally disinclined to accept divine honours, he did not seriously oppose the current trend and had a temple erected to himself in Camulodunum. His public works include the reorganization of the grain supply of Rome and construction of a new harbour at Ostia, which was later improved by the emperor Trajan. [...] speak freely on the civil wars toward the end of the Roman Republic, he began a history of Rome with the principate of Augustus. He composed 20 books of Etruscan and 8 books of Carthaginian history, all in Greek; an autobiography; and a historical treatise on the Roman alphabet with suggestions for orthographical reform—which as emperor he later tried not very successfully to implement. He also wrote on dice playing, of which he was fond. All his works are lost, and their importance cannot be measured. The Etruscan history may have had original material: his first wife, Plautia Urgulanilla, had Etruscan blood, and her family was probably able to put Claudius in touch with authentic Etruscan traditions. After divorcing Urgulanilla, he in turn married Aelia Paetina, Valeria Messalina, who [...] ### What were Claudius’s achievements?\n\nClaudius invaded Britain in 43. He also expanded the empire by annexing Mauretania, Lycia in Asia Minor, and Thrace and enlarging and reorganizing imperial possessions in the Near East. Claudius’s general policy increased the emperor’s control over the treasury and the provincial administration and apparently gave his own governors in senatorial provinces jurisdiction over fiscal matters.\n\n### How did Claudius die?"

He built or finished two aqueducts \"Aqueduct (Roman)\"), the Aqua Claudia, begun by Caligula, and the Aqua Anio Novus. These entered the city in 52 and met at the Porta Maggiore. He also restored a third, the Aqua Virgo. [...] Momigliano, Arnaldo (1934). Claudius, the Emperor and His Achievement. Translated by W.D. Hogarth. W.

[...] ## Scholarly works and their impact\n\n[edit]\n\nClaudius wrote copiously throughout his life. Arnaldo Momigliano states that during the reign of Tiberius, which covers the peak of Claudius's literary career, it became impolitic to speak of republican Rome. The trend among the young historians was either to write about the new empire or about obscure antiquarian topics. Claudius was the rare scholar who covered both."
