For instance, NEOMA partnered with ENEDIS, a major electricity grid operator in France, to create an immersive case study experience for its Global Executive MBA.\n\nIn addition, the school uses AI-powered adaptive learning processes to sort students into slower or faster learners. This allows faculty to adapt the type and quantity of exercises they provide in the classroom while putting more focus on areas that are more challenging. Taking these insights one step further, professors can turn fast learners into mentors who help other students and thus contribute to the success of the entire class. [...] Acting as a digital mentor, the AI application analyzes a student’s career ambitions and proposes the best training opportunities. It even allows participants to go through an assessment phase to evaluate the skills they need to improve before they embark on their personalized learning paths.\n\nTo create programs tailored to unique individuals, FLEXA sorts through about 800,000 pieces of learning material, from digital courses and webinars to podcasts, articles, and case studies. Because it maintains profiles of interested professionals, FLEXA also can serve as a digital recruiting platform for corporations looking to hire new talent.\n\n### An IDEA for the Future Classroom [...] About\n\n Careers\n Contact Us\n\n1.

Furthermore, AI-enhanced feedback mechanisms provide continuous guidance, enabling a structured and iterative learning experience that promotes both creative development and skill mastery (Dönmez, 2024). This integration not only boosts student engagement and performance but also bridges the gap between technological advancement and creative expression, ensuring that applied photography education evolves in tandem with AI innovations (Das & Rani, 2024; Hasibuan & Azizah, 2023). Despite AI’s growing presence in education, its comprehensive integration into applied creative disciplines remains an underexplored area (Coeckelbergh, 2023; Wan et al., 2024). While existing studies highlight AI’s influence on [...] course. Specifically, it investigates AI’s impact on creativity and technical skill development in applied higher education contexts, explores educators’ experiences in designing and implementing AI-supported creative courses, and proposes a framework for the effective and ethical integration of AI in hands-on disciplines. Furthermore, the findings are intended to guide higher education institutions in developing best practices for incorporating AI into both theoretical and practical learning processes. By addressing these underexplored dimensions, this study seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of AI’s role in education and to serve as a valuable resource for academics, curriculum designers, and policymakers aiming to implement AI-driven pedagogical strategies effectively. [...] to learning efficiency and real-time feedback mechanisms. Jegede (2024) noted that AI tools facilitate more effective learning by enabling students to track their progress and receive individualized feedback. Additionally, AI-based learning systems assist instructors in identifying students’ weaknesses more efficiently and in providing customized instructional content, as demonstrated in studies by Filiz et al. (2025), Song (2024), Fošner (2024), Sternberg (2024), and Al Samman (2024). Benayache and Mourad (2024) further found that AI-supported education promotes individualized learning pathways, allowing students to engage more effectively with complex topics. However, while AI enhances personalization and efficiency in education, it also introduces potential challenges. Some studies"

Educators Spend 70% Less Time Grading Assignments By Using an AI-Powered Grading Tool\n\nGradescope is a platform designed to streamline the grading process, delivering benefits to both educators and students.\n\nThe AI tech was shown to reduce the amount of time teachers spent on grading by 70%. The platform operates by allowing students to upload their assignments, which are then sorted and grouped by Gradescope. Educators have access to per-question and per-rubric statistics, providing valuable insights into student performance. [...] A Stanford researcher developed an AI program to provide students with assistance when they get stuck in self-paced digital learning. The study tested a machine-learning program that would predict when a student was likely to get stuck and start “wheel-spinning”, at which point it would recommend a relevant solution. The program was trained by analyzing performance data from 1,170 Ugandan school children who had used tablets to learn English reading skills through videos and mini-games. The program was able to predict whether a child would fall into “wheel-spinning”, even before they had begun a new lesson.
