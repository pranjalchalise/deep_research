      "snippet": "### Overview\n\n LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain, designed to create cyclic graphs for LLM-based AI agents.\n It enables cyclic graph topologies for workflows, allowing more flexible and nuanced agent behaviors than linear models.\n Utilizes key elements:  \n   — Nodes: Represent functions or LangChain runnable items.  \n   — Edges: Define execution and data flow.  \n   — Stateful graphs: Manage persistent data across execution cycles.\n Supports multi-agent coordination, allowing each agent to have its own prompt, LLM, tools and custom code within a single graph.\n Introduces a chat agent executor that represents agent state as a list of messages, ideal for chat-based models.\n\n### Key Components [...] ### How LangGraph works\n\nLangGraph enables cyclic LLM call execution with state persistence, essential for agentic behavior. LangGraph Inspired by Pregel and Apache Beam and modeled after the NetworkX library for user-friendly graph-based programming offers a more advanced approach to agent runtimes. Unlike its predecessors, which rely on basic loops, LangGraph supports intricate systems of nodes and edges, allowing developers to create more complex decision-making processes and action sequences. [...] LangGraph is an advanced library within the LangChain ecosystem addresses these limitations by introducing cyclic computational capabilities. While LangChain supports Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for linear workflows, LangGraph enables the creation of cycles, allowing LLM agents to dynamically loop through processes and make decisions based on evolving conditions. This framework empowers developers to build more complex, flexible, and adaptive agent systems.\n\n### Overview"

      "snippet": "# What is LangGraph?\n\n## Authors\n\nBryan Clark \n\nSenior Technology Advocate\n\n## LangGraph overview\n\nLangGraph, created by LangChain, is an open source AI agent framework designed to build, deploy and manage complex generative AI agent workflows. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable users to create, run and optimize large language models (LLMs) in a scalable and efficient manner. At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow. [...] LangGraph workflow\n\nLangGraph illuminates the processes within an AI workflow, allowing full transparency of the agent’s state. Within LangGraph, the “state” feature serves as a memory bank that records and tracks all the valuable information processed by the AI system. It’s similar to a digital notebook where the system captures and updates data as it moves through various stages of a workflow or graph analysis. [...] Agent systems: LangGraph provides a framework for building agent-based systems, which can be used in applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles or video games.\n\nLLM applications: By using LangGraph’s capabilities, developers can build more sophisticated AI models that learn and improve over time. Norwegian Cruise Line uses LangGraph to compile, construct and refine guest-facing AI solutions. This capability allows for improved and personalized guest experiences.\n\n## LLM integration in LangGraph"

      "snippet": "In our case, we built an AI Listing Manager Agent capable of web scraping (crawl4ai), categorization, human feedback integration, and database management.\n\nThe system is made of 7 specialized Pydantic AI agents connected with Langgraph. We have integrated Streamlit for the chat interface.\n\nEach agent takes on a specific task:\n\nSearch agent: Searches the internet for potential new listings\n\nFiltering agent: Ensures listings meet our quality standards.\n\nSummarizer agent: Extract the information we want in the format we want\n\nClassifier agent: Assigns categories and tags following our internal classification guidelines\n\nFeedback agent: Collects human feedback before final approval.\n\nRectifier agent: Modifies listings according to our feedback [...] r/AI_Agents icon\n\n# The Most Powerful Way to Build AI Agents: LangGraph + Pydantic AI (Detailed Example)\n\nAfter struggling with different frameworks like CrewAI and LangChain, I've discovered that combining LangGraph with Pydantic AI is the most powerful method for building scalable AI agent systems.\n\nPydantic AI: Perfect for defining highly specialized agents quickly. It makes adding new capabilities to each agent straightforward without impacting existing ones.\n\nLangGraph: Great for orchestrating multiple agents. It lets you easily define complex workflows, integrate human-in-the-loop interactions, maintain state memory, and scale as your system grows in complexity [...] Publisher agent: Publishes agents to the directory\n\nIn LangGraph, you create a separate node for each agent. Inside each node, you run the agent, then save whatever the agent outputs into the flow's state.\n\nThe trick is making sure the output type from your Pydantic AI agent exactly matches the data type you're storing in LangGraph state. This way, when the next agent runs, it simply grabs the previous agent’s results from the LangGraph state, does its thing, and updates another part of the state. By doing this, each agent stays independent, but they can still easily pass information to each other."

      "snippet": "This makes LangGraph ideal for orchestrating agents that need to perform iterative tasks, coordinate multiple agents, or manage workflows that aren’t just linear sequences.\n\nIt also supports persistent memory and state storage, so your AI agents can remember essential details throughout long-running processes.\n\nNow that you know what LangChain and LangGraph are, let’s see how to combine them to build a powerful multistep research agent.\n\n## Build a multistep research agent using LangChain and LangGraph\n\nLet’s build a research assistant that searches, reasons, summarizes, and remembers. This agent will:\n\n Take a user query\n Search the web\n Summarize the results\n Store the result in memory\n Respond back with a final summary [...] ## What is LangGraph\n\nThink of LangGraph as the graph engine that powers intelligent AI workflows. While LangChain provides the building blocks for agents, LangGraph helps you connect those blocks into complex, stateful workflows with branching, looping, and multi-agent coordination.\n\nBuilt on top of LangChain, LangGraph lets you define:\n\n Nodes: Individual steps or actions in your workflow, like asking a question or calling a tool\n Edges: Paths that connect nodes and determine the flow\n States: Data and context stored across steps to maintain memory and decision history\n Conditional transitions: Logic to decide which path to take next based on agent outputs or external conditions [...] LangChain supports different agent types, from reactive agents responding to one task at a time, to conversational agents tracking history and planning multistep actions. Here are some real-world use cases of LangChain:\n\n Coding copilots that use online docs and run code\n Travel planners that interact with search and map APIs\n AI tutors that remember student progress and adapt lessons\n Data analyzers that ingest documents, summarize, and answer questions\n\nLangChain provides modular building blocks for designing capable agents, but agents still need a brain that can coordinate decisions, loop over logic, and manage branching workflows. And that’s where LangGraph takes over.\n\n## What is LangGraph"
