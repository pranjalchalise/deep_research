      "snippet": "# LangChain Overview for Beginners! [Updated 2026]\n## Pavan Belagatti\n761000 subscribers\n18 likes\n\n### Description\n513 views\nPosted: 9 Jan 2026\nIn this video, we build a real Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application from scratch using LangChain, Streamlit, and SingleStore. Instead of a simple chatbot, you’ll learn how to design an AI system that can upload documents, break them into meaningful chunks, generate embeddings, store them in a persistent vector database, and answer questions using only the retrieved context. [...] started uh saying hey what is lang chain let me use lang chain and and uh that went on Jan 18th 2023 and then Feb 9th was their first uh meetup uh uh was their first meetup uh held and uh then Feb 20th uh they got 10k stars on GitHub and then April 4th 2023 3 um 10 million plus benchmark uh and they raised um on 13th of uh April 2023 they raised 200 million valuation from u Sequoa and u and then July 28th 2023 the first managed service came out that is Langmith we all know and uh announcing uh our 10 million seed funding uh led by benchmark I mean that's that happened on April 4th fourth as you can see above and again uh uh October 2nd 2023 they re I mean like they reached 63.4K stars with some enterprise clients. So this is an amazing uh growth story of lang chain. it is still growing [...] We start by understanding why LangChain exists and how it helps structure AI workflows beyond prompt engineering. You’ll see how LangChain documents, text splitters, embeddings, retrievers, and prompt templates come together to form a reliable RAG pipeline. On the frontend, we use Streamlit to build a ChatGPT-like interface with streaming responses, while SingleStore acts as the vector database that stores embeddings and enables fast semantic search.\n\nAlong the way, we tackle real-world problems like hallucinations, incomplete retrieval, and mixed document context. You’ll learn how to debug retrieval results, tune chunking and top-K search, reset the knowledge base for clean demos, and enforce strict prompt rules so the model answers only from your data."
