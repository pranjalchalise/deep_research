      "snippet": "Conclusion Peirce’s categories are self-consciously historical in their articulation, three in number, var-ious in name (though these names are divisible into two main “categories”: technical des-ignations, most notably, firstness, secondness, and thirdness; and more familiar terms—quality, fact, and law; immediacy, opposition, and mediation; etc.), heuristic in function (specifically, diacritical and synoptic in their heuristic function, for the categories help us to distinguish between or among phenomena ordinarily confused with one an-other, this being the diacritical function of the categories, and also to discern affinities and similarities between or among phenomena ordinarily supposed to be utterly disparate or unrelated to one another, this being their synoptic function), [...] Despite these radically divergent conceptions of the most highly general concepts, these conceptions are akin in their generality and hence scope. One might reasonably object that the term category is an irreducibly equivocal one, but Peirce’s definition surprisingly remains unscathed by this objection; for the function of his definition bears upon the minimal continuity requisite for comparative judgments. [...] are, in a sense, data of experience—if we only had eyes to see or ears to hear. Hence, philosophical discourse requires a twofold vocabulary. On the one hand, it requires (like other sciences) technical terms by which to designate precisely its own theoretical conceptions; on the other, it must rely on the ready-made terms of every-day language. Whereas technical terms such as firstness, secondness, and thirdness help to foster is the awareness that, e.g., firstness is not unequivocally identifiable with any tra-ditional notion, even ones quite closely allied to it (e.g., quality, immediacy, and sponta-neity). What more familiar words help to make clear is the immanence of the categories: the categories are patterns woven into the very fabric of experience and, indeed, of reality itself."
