      "snippet": "Retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a process applied to LLMs to make their outputs more relevant in specific contexts. RAG allows LLMs to access and reference information outside the LLMs own training data, such as an organization’s specific knowledge base, before generating a response—and, crucially, with citations included. This capability enables LLMs to produce highly specific outputs without extensive fine-tuning or training, delivering some of the benefits of a custom LLM at considerably less expense. [...] Drafting assistants. When an employee starts drafting a report or document that requires company-specific data or information, the RAG system retrieves the relevant information from enterprise data sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, and other systems, then provides the employee with prepopulated sections of the document. This output can help the employee develop the document more efficiently and more accurately. [...] RAG has far-reaching applications in various domains, including customer service, marketing, finance, and knowledge management. By integrating RAG into existing systems, businesses can generate outputs that are more accurate than they would be using an off-the-shelf LLM, which can improve customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and enhance overall performance. Here are some specific examples of where and how RAG can be applied:"

      "snippet": "By fine-tuning or prompt-engineering the LLM to generate text entirely based on the retrieved knowledge, RAG helps to minimize contradictions and inconsistencies in the generated text. This significantly improves the quality of the generated text, and improves the user experience. [...] Advanced search engines like Vertex AI Search use semantic search and keyword search together (called hybrid search), and a re-ranker which scores search results to ensure the top returned results are the most relevant. Additionally searches perform better with a clear, focused query without misspellings; so prior to lookup, sophisticated search engines will transform a query and fix spelling mistakes.\n\n### Relevance, accuracy, and quality\n\nThe retrieval mechanism in RAG is critically important. You need the best semantic search on top of a curated knowledge base to ensure that the retrieved information is relevant to the input query or context. If your retrieved information is irrelevant, your generation could be grounded but off-topic or incorrect. [...] # What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI framework that combines the strengths of traditional information retrieval systems (such as search and databases) with the capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs). By combining your data and world knowledge with LLM language skills, grounded generation is more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to your specific needs.

      "snippet": "# What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\n## What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architecture for optimizing the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) model by connecting it with external knowledge bases. RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\n\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs. However, training datasets are finite and limited to the information the AI developer can access—public domain works, internet articles, social media content and other publicly accessible data. [...] Standard LLMs source information from their training datasets. RAG adds an information retrieval component to the AI workflow, gathering relevant information and feeding that to the generative AI model to enhance response quality and utility.\n\nRAG systems follow a five-stage process:\n\n1. The user submits a prompt.\n2. The information retrieval model queries the knowledge base for relevant data.\n3. Relevant information is returned from the knowledge base to the integration layer.\n4. The RAG system engineers an augmented prompt to the LLM with enhanced context from the retrieved data.\n5. The LLM generates an output and returns an output to the user. [...] ### Access to current and domain-specific data\n\nGenerative AI models have a knowledge cutoff, the point at which their training data was last updated. As a model ages further past its knowledge cutoff, it loses relevance over time. RAG systems connect models with supplemental external data in real-time and incorporate up-to-date information into generated responses.\n\nEnterprises use RAG to equip models with specific information such as proprietary customer data, authoritative research and other relevant documents."

      "snippet": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) comes as a breakthrough in natural language processing, blending the power of pre-trained language models with the vast knowledge stored in external textual databases. RAG is a framework designed to enhance language generation tasks by retrieving and conditioning on relevant documents, effectively augmenting the pool of information a model can draw from when generating text. This fusion of retrieval and generation facilitates more informed and contextually relevant outputs, particularly in question-answering and conversational AI systems. [...] The implementation of RAG shows significant improvements over standard language models, especially in cases where specific knowledge or factual accuracy is critical. Moreover, its design addresses the challenge of keeping language models up-to-date with the latest information without the need for constant retraining, thus paving the way for more dynamic and knowledgeable AI systems.\n\n## Fundamentals of RAG\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) bridges the gap between information retrieval and language generation, significantly enhancing the capabilities of language models.\n\n### Overview of RAG technology [...] ### Content generation\n\nRAG significantly contributes to content generation by automating the creation of detailed articles, reports, and summaries.

      "snippet": "## What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. By incorporating new and context-aware data, AI can generate more accurate, current and domain-specific responses.\n\nRAG is quickly becoming the go-to architecture for building enterprise-grade AI applications. According to recent surveys, over 60% of organizations are developing AI-powered retrieval tools to improve reliability, reduce hallucinations and personalize outputs using internal data. [...] ## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?  \nRAG is an AI architecture that strengthens LLMs by retrieving relevant documents and injecting them into the prompt. This enables more accurate, current and domain-specific responses without taking time to retrain the model.\n\nWhen should I use RAG instead of fine-tuning?  \nUse RAG when you want to incorporate dynamic data without the cost or complexity of fine-tuning. It is ideal for use cases where accurate and timely information is required. [...] Read now\n\n## How RAG works\n\nRAG enhances a language model’s output by injecting it with context-aware and real-time information retrieved from an external data source. When a user submits a query, the system first engages the retrieval model, which uses a vector database to identify and “retrieve” semantically similar documents, databases or other sources for relevant information. Once identified, it then combines those results with the original input prompt and sends it to a generative AI model, which synthesizes the new information into its own model.\n\nThis allows the LLM to produce more accurate, context-aware answers grounded in enterprise-specific or up-to-date data, rather than simply relying upon the model it was trained on."
