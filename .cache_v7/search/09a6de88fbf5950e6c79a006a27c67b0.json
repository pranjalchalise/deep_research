Instead of going through lengthy, costly onboarding processes for another SaaS solution, we just go through Google, or spin up the open-source dependency in one of our GKE clusters,\" says Pierce.\n\n# Drilling into detail\n\nAlongside Google Cloud Logging, which records specific system events, Dandy needed a dedicated observability solution to monitor tracing and metrics and further improve the quality and reliability of its software service.\n\nChoosing Chronosphere, a Google Cloud partner, was a clear decision. \"Chronosphere is built from the ground up to work with Google Cloud. We can get all our Google-native metrics into Chronosphere, and engineers no longer need to jump back and forth between tools.\" [...] Best of all, Dandy is now equipped to meet fast-growing demand for its ground-breaking digital dental services. By the end of 2024, 75 percent of US dental practices will have adopted a digital model for check-ups, scanning, and fixture manufacturing. \"There are more than 180,000 dental practices in the US,\" says Pierce. \"With Google Cloud and Chronosphere, we are well positioned to rise up to this opportunity while providing vastly improved patient and dentist experiences.\"\n\nDandy, the digital dental lab, empowers thousands of dental practices with innovative technologies to advance patient care and revolutionize the way they scan, order, and manage casework. With Dandy, clinicians have delivered happy smiles to over 1.5M patients with enhanced control and predictability. [...] As a fast-moving start up, Dandy was impressed by the pace of innovation set by Chronosphere. Pierce says that every couple of weeks brings a new improvement to the solution. \"One week it was a new menu bar, the next it was a new trace explorer. I'm always excited before our weekly syncs because I want to know what kind of enhancements are coming our way,\" he says."
