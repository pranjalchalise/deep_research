      "snippet": "Retrieval-augmented generation is set to play a crucial role in the future of LLMs by enhancing the integration of retrieval and generation processes. Expected advancements in this area will lead to more seamless and sophisticated fusion of these components, enabling LLMs to deliver highly accurate and contextually relevant outputs across a broader range of applications and industries.  \n   \n As RAG continues to evolve, we can anticipate its adoption in new domains such as personalized education, where it can tailor learning experiences based on individual needs, and advanced research tools, offering precise and comprehensive information retrieval for complex inquiries. [...] Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines a retrieval model with a generative model. It retrieves related information from a database or document set and uses it to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This approach enhances the quality of AI-generated text by grounding it in real-world data, making it particularly useful for tasks like answering questions, summarizing, and creating content.\n RAG improves AI-generated content by incorporating external data. It retrieves relevant information from a database and then uses that data to generate more accurate and context-aware responses. This process ensures that the AI system’s output is better informed and more reliable. [...] RAG combines a large language model (LLM) with a retrieval mechanism. While an LLM generates text based on pre-trained data, RAG enhances this by retrieving relevant information from external sources in real time, improving accuracy and relevance. Essentially, LLM relies on learned patterns, while RAG actively pulls in up-to-date information to inform its responses."

With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM's pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data. For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources.

Unlike LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don't exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments."

      "snippet": "# What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\n## What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architecture for optimizing the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) model by connecting it with external knowledge bases. RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\n\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs. However, training datasets are finite and limited to the information the AI developer can access—public domain works, internet articles, social media content and other publicly accessible data. [...] RAG and fine-tuning are often contrasted but can be used in tandem. Fine-tuning increases a model’s familiarity with the intended domain and output requirements, while RAG assists the model in generating relevant, high-quality outputs.\n\nTechsplainers | Podcast | What is RAG?\n\n### Listen to: 'What is RAG?'\n\nFollow Techsplainers: Spotifyand Apple Podcasts\n\nFind more episodes\n\nLink copied\n\nEbook   Unlock the power of generative AI and ML \n\nLearn how to confidently incorporate generative AI and machine learning into your business.\n\n Read the ebook\n\n## Resources\n\nVirtual event and hackathon   AI demystified: IBM Dev Day \n\nKick-off your new year with a no-cost event on 29 January 2026 featuring dozens of AI experts focused on next generation resources for AI builders.\n\n Register now [...] Standard LLMs source information from their training datasets. RAG adds an information retrieval component to the AI workflow, gathering relevant information and feeding that to the generative AI model to enhance response quality and utility.\n\nRAG systems follow a five-stage process:\n\n1. The user submits a prompt.\n2. The information retrieval model queries the knowledge base for relevant data.\n3. Relevant information is returned from the knowledge base to the integration layer.\n4. The RAG system engineers an augmented prompt to the LLM with enhanced context from the retrieved data.\n5. The LLM generates an output and returns an output to the user."
