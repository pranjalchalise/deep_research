This article explores the differences between traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) and the innovative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, shedding light on how these technologies shape our interaction with AI.\n\n## The Limitations of Traditional Language Models [...] These limitations can lead to issues in real-world applications, such as providing outdated medical advice, missing critical legal updates, or failing to recognize the latest trends in technology and finance. Imagine asking a traditional LLM, “What are the latest developments in renewable energy?” Its response might be well-written but could miss crucial recent breakthroughs or policy changes.\n\n## Enter Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems\n\nRAG systems represent a significant leap forward in AI technology. But how do they work, and what makes them different? [...] 1. Query Embedding: The system converts the query into a vector that captures its semantic meaning, understanding that you’re asking about recent advancements in renewable energy.\n2. Document Comparison: The system compares this query vector to the vectors of recent articles stored in its constantly updated database. These might include news about solar technology breakthroughs, wind farm expansions, or new energy policies.\n3. Retrieval: Based on vector similarity, the system retrieves the most relevant articles. It might pull information about a new record in solar cell efficiency, an innovative offshore wind project, and recent government incentives for renewable energy."

      "snippet": "a wide range of topics35. (2024).\"). This comparison aims to explore the trade-offs between specialized architecture and general capability in domain-specific applications such as tobacco research. This dual-configuration approach allows us to compare the performance of these models within the RAG framework, providing valuable insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses in handling tobacco-related queries. To ensure a fair comparison, we implement consistent retrieval mechanisms and prompt templates across both configurations, isolating the impact of the base language model on overall system performance. [...] To overcome these challenges, RAG systems have emerged as promising solutions. RAG systems combine the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the precision of domain-specific knowledge bases, enabling them to retrieve and synthesize information more effectively than traditional retrieval methods do. By leveraging the strengths of both retrieval and generation, RAG systems can provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses to complex queries, making them particularly useful in specialized domains such as tobacco research, where the need for accurate information is high12.\"),13. Singapore: Springer Nature Singapore. (2024).\"). [...] The RAG system evaluation begins with the setup of two parallel configurations using Mixtral 8 × 7B and Llama 3.1 70B as base language models. Mixtral 8 × 7B, a mixture-of-experts model known for efficiency and task-specific performance, and Llama 3.1 70B, a larger model with broad general language understanding. Moreover, the Mixtral 8 × 7B model is particularly advantageous for scenarios requiring rapid inference and low latency, making it ideal for real-time applications where efficiency is crucial34.\"). In contrast, Llama 3.1 70B’s extensive training on diverse datasets equips it with a robust understanding of nuanced language and complex queries, enabling it to generate more contextually relevant and coherent responses across a wide range of topics35.

That is a technique to passively examine the the latest user input and the context of conversation, and then use embeddings or other search technique to fill the AI model context with specialized knowledge relevant to the topic. Usually used for making an AI that can answer about closed-domain problems, such as company knowledgebase. [...] Langchain is instead an agent. It gives the AI multiple iterations it can perform with multiple semi-autonomous steps until a job is completed. That can be improving an answer until it is optimum, or can be actions fulfilled by multiple calls, like browsing pages or documents (although this is best done by native tuning like “functions”, not by prompting alone). Far more expensive and possible to run out of control against your account balance.\n\n## post by rahkilsdonk on Nov 27, 2023\n\nrahkilsdonk\n\nNov 2023\n\nAgents is a part of Langchain.\n\nAs RAG has already been explained. Langchain is library in Python that acts as an interface between different language models, vector stores and all kinds of libraries. It makes it easier to build RAG models and other LLM solutions. [...] Note that it is LLM model agnostic and is not reliant on one single LLM provider, like OpenAI.\n\n  \n\n### Related topics\n\nTopic list, column headers with buttons are sortable.\n\n| Topic | Replies | Views | Activity |\n| The difference of Assistant api and langchain  API | 5 | 12.3k | Dec 2023 |\n| Llamaindex vs langchain, which one should be used  API | 5 | 40.5k | Jul 2023 |\n| What is the difference between conversationalretrievalchain.from\\_llm and openaifunctionagent in langchain?
