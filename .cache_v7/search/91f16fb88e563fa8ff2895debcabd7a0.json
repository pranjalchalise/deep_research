Initially a farmer's son with limited formal education, Marius excelled in military service, first fighting in Spain against the Numantines and later rising through the ranks. His political career began in the Roman Republic, where he served as tribune of the people and later as consul multiple times, notably during critical military conflicts such as the Jugurthine War and against Germanic tribes like the Cimbri and Teutons. [...] ## Gaius Marius\n\nRoman general\n\nMarius was a successful Roman general whose military innovations created the professional army of the late Roman Republic and early Empire. Representing the Popular Party, he was elected consul seven times.\n\n## Early Life [...] Marius is particularly known for his military reforms, including the recruitment of volunteers from the lower classes, which transformed the Roman army into a professional fighting force. This shift not only enhanced military effectiveness but also changed soldiers' loyalties from the state to their generals, laying the groundwork for future political upheaval. Despite his military successes, Marius struggled politically, especially during his later years, where his ambition led him into tumultuous alliances that ultimately resulted in his political downfall. He died in 86 BCE, leaving behind a legacy marked by military innovation but marred by his failures in political leadership amidst Rome's growing civil discord.\n\n## Gaius Marius\n\nRoman general"

      "snippet": "Marius was a scholar and chronicler by the age of twenty, traveling quite a lot and visiting all the great European cities. When he is twenty-five, he meets a ten year old girl named Lydia at the home of her father, a Roman senator, and is impressed by her interest in poetry. Marius asks to become betrothed to Lydia, with the intention that it will delay his own obligation to get married until she is of marriageable age. He is denied by her father, who explains to Lydia that this is the reason he was rejected. Lydia encounters Marius once more at a religious festival when she is fifteen, and informs him that she asked her father to allow them to get married, but was denied again due to Marius's lower social status. [...] ## Personality[]\n\nMarius is an exceptionally sagacious, wise and optimistic vampire. He loves to read and to write, and sees himself as a historian and a continual observer of the history of the human race. Marius's interests include all manner of intellectual and artistic pursuits, including filmmaking, writing, and most notably, painting. Marius is obsessed with the art created by humans, but is distraught by his inability to create art that is not somewhat unnatural due to his vampiric nature. Marius is frequently torn between his desire to live among humans and the limitations of his ability to do so. Despite his age, he prefers to move and act like a human in situations where he could otherwise use his vampiric powers. [...] When the Court of Prince Lestat is established, Marius is named Lestat's Prime Minister. It's specified that his role acts for Lestat as Chief Ministers did for the old French Kings in history, rather than the modern definition of the title. As a vampire lawmaker, he and Lestat negotiate with the Replimoids, and Marius is in charge of drafting a new vampire constitution. In Lestat's narration Marius is described as thriving in his leadership role and new sense of purpose, but other points of view note that Marius seems exhausted and lonely. It is mentioned that Daniel left Marius for Armand, and Marius is seen attempting to reconnect with his fledgling Bianca, who lives at court."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship"

      "snippet": "So who was Gaius Marius?\n\nHumble origins\n\nMarius started out in an equestrian family which, despite relative affluence, remained outside of Rome’s snobbish aristocracy. He married into a rich family, which gave him the political patronage he needed to become a tribune in 119 BC and a praetor in 115 BC. Serving as a governor in one of Rome’s Spanish provinces, Marius gained priceless military experience from his counter-insurgency campaigns against Rome’s tribal enemies. Carefully and meticulously, the Roman governor studied the hit-and-run tactics of his foes, allowing him to master the art of conquest. [...] Marius further distinguished himself by serving as a junior military officer in the Jugurthine War in 109 BC. Exploiting his military prestige, the unorthodox Marius broke from tradition by running for the consulship in 107 BC. To bolster his electoral prospects, Marius presented himself as a true man of the people. He styled himself as a populist, whose personal competence and merit outshone the arbitrary privileges of Rome’s archaic aristocracy. “They may look down on my humble origins,” the gruff general remarked of Rome’s aristocrats, “but I have nothing but disdain for their idleness.”\n\nShare [...] Yet the overconfident general overstepped his boundaries, and seized dictatorial powers. In so doing, Marius hollowed out the vestiges of Rome’s republican constitution, which had previously prevented the rule of a single dictator or ruler. Marius aligned himself with a tribune named Saturnius, who introduced a majesty law, which criminalized certain forms of speech. The unpopular law was detested by the Senate and the Roman populace alike. The public hated it, and riots broke out in the streets. To restore order, the Senate reluctantly authorized Marius to unleash his professional soldiers on the Roman people. It was yet another turning point in Rome’s history. Never before had a Roman used the armed forces against a fellow Roman. The disgraced Marius was deeply hated, and he abruptly"

      "snippet": "1. ^ Marcus Marius was a few years younger than Gaius Marius. He was elected as a praetor for 102 BC and later served as governor pro consule of Hispania Ulterior. The younger Marius, however, would never be able to attain the consulship, likely dying in the 90s BC.\n2. ^ Beyond army proletarianisation, attested in Sallust, the only reforms attributed to Marius in the ancient evidence are his redesigned pilum and the introduction of the aquila. Both claims are given in relatively late sources, removed by centuries from Marius' time. They are also both disproved by, respectively, archaeological and documentary evidence.\n3. ^ The Ambrones had apparently camped apart from the Teutones. [...] Soon thereafter, in 117 BC, Marius stood for the aedileship and lost. It seems clear that by this time, due to the enormous financial difficulties that any prospective aedile would have to shoulder, Marius had either amassed or was availed of significant financial resources. This loss was at least in part due to the enmity of the Metelli. In 116 BC he barely won election as praetor for the following year, coming in last, and was promptly accused of ambitus (electoral corruption). Being accused of electoral corruption was common during the middle and late Republic and details of the trial are sketchy or apocryphal. Marius, however, was able to win acquittal on this charge, and spent an uneventful year as praetor in Rome, likely as either praetor peregrinus or as president of the corruption [...] While Marius had seemingly broken with the Caecilii Metelli during his time as tribune and praetor, the Metelli did not seem to hold this rupture against him so much as to pass over him for selection as legate in the opening phases of the Jugurthine War. In 109 BC, likely to improve his chances for the consulship, Marius joined then-consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus in his campaign against Jugurtha. In Sallust's long account of Metellus's campaign, no other legates are mentioned, so Marius was probably Metellus's senior subordinate and right-hand man. Metellus was using Marius's strong military experience, while Marius was strengthening his position to stand for the consulship."

Furthermore, a dispute for the honour of the victory arose among the soldiers, as was natural, and the members of an embassy from Parma were p539chosen to act as arbitrators. These men the soldiers of Catulus conducted among the dead bodies of the enemy, which were clearly seen to have been pierced by their javelins; for these could be known by the name of Catulus which had been cut into the shaft. 5 However, the entire success was attributed to Marius, both on account of his former victory and of his superior rank.⁠28 Above [...] (the Roman term for our representatives at law) to bear witness against clients, and that the law relieved them of this necessity; and p475not only the parents of Marius but Marius himself had originally been clients of the house of the Herennii. 5 The jurors accepted this plea in avoidance of testimony, but Marius himself contradicted Herennius, declaring that as soon as he had been elected to his magistracy he had ceased to be a client; which was not altogether true. For it is not every magistracy that frees its occupants (as well as their posterity) from their relations to a patron, but only that to which the law assigns the curule chair.
