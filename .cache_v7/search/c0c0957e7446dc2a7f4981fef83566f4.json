The philosophy of reductive empiricim and its impact on the contemporary debates in the analytic philosophy of science are analysed in this paper. Reductive empiricism, mostly associated with the philosophy of science of logical positivism, aims to show, how theoretical terms can be reduced to the observational terms, thus eliminating the former from the language of science. [Show full abstract]]() is often considered to be a type of semantic scientific antirealism, which is unsuccessful due to the inner flaws of the idea of theoretical terms reduction to observational terms, for example, unsuccessful application of Bertrand Russell logical formalism or hidden presuppositions of verificationism. I argue, that reductive empiricism, as a part of programme of early logical positivism, fails not because of the idea of theoretical terms reduction to the observational terms itself, but because of hidden assumption, that successful reduction immediately implies the epistemology of empiricism. ### Peirce's philosophy of science, logic and epistemology. ### Lezioni di filosofia della scienza. ### Indirizzi Fondazionali in Filosofia della Matematica.

An analysis of the activities of the Pierces, of which this is the first published study, can add new light to understanding the local and national context of medical quackery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Buffalo after the Civil War was a growing metropolis. In 1860, the population stood at 81,000. It was largely dependent for its success upon the Erie Canal, and later railroad links which made it the point of transhipment of goods to and from the Great Lakes. The city's favorable geographic position soon led to the development of a variety of industries including lumber, iron, livestock, soap, and printing. In 1869, an industrial exposition was held in Buffalo boosting its then current and potential [...] Could this reevaluation extend to patent-medicine makers as well? In 1974, Terrence Wilmer completed a doctoral dissertation on the elder Pierce, entitled Apostle of Truth or Advocate of Deception?. Wilmer's portrait was revisionist. Rather than viewing him primarily in the context of quackery, he saw Pierce as an entrepreneur, a \"man deeply involved in the spirit of his time,\" as \"an interpreter of his civilization\" and \"an astute observer.\" Wilmer believed that by understanding the appeal of Pierce one could gain insight into the values, concems, and popular beliefs of the era. While this orientation has 176 Gevitz much merit, in the process Wilmer tended to minimize or explain away some of his most questionable behavior, for example, seeing the Comrr~n Sense Medical Adviser, despite [...] 57: 1983, pp. 22-43.

      "snippet": "Plant secretome studies highlight the importance of vascular plant defense proteins against pathogens. Studies on Pierce's disease of grapevines caused by the xylem-limited bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) have detected proteins and pathways associated with its pathobiology. Despite the biological importance of the secreted proteins in the extracellular space to plant survival and development, proteome studies are scarce due to methodological challenges. Prosit, a deep learning neural network prediction method is a powerful tool for improving proteome profiling by data-independent acquisition (DIA). We explored the potential of Prosit's in silico spectral library predictions to improve DIA proteomic analysis of vascular leaf sap from grapevines with Pierce's disease. The combination of [...] from grapevines with Pierce's disease. The combination of DIA and Prosit-predicted libraries increased the total number of identified grapevine proteins from 145 to 360 and Xf proteins from 18 to 90 compared to gas-phase fractionation (GPF) libraries. The new proteins increased the range of molecular weights, assisted in the identification of more exclusive peptides per protein, and increased identification of low-abundance proteins. These improvements allowed identification of new functional pathways associated with cellular responses to oxidative stress, to be investigated further.
