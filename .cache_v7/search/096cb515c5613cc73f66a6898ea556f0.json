      "snippet": "A: [One hope is for computer science] to be less walled-off from every other field, discipline, and community. I think [that] it’s crucial that boundaries between computation and other disciplines be broken down, that everybody can be involved, and that everyone has a say.\n\nIt’s crucial that people with a liberal arts background are involved with technology more than they [currently] are. And I think it’s important for the science and industry of computation to be a product of humanity, not of some small, self-selected subcultures as it currently is.\n\nQ: What do you like to do in your free time? [...] Q: What are your current research interests and how has your research gone so far?\n\nA: My research is pretty broad — I work in a lot of different project areas. Most of them touch on computing and AI in some way. For example, I have projects on understanding human creativity, quantum computing, and artificial life.\n\nThe center of gravity for a lot of my recent research is something called evolutionary computation. This is work at the intersection of AI and evolutionary biology. The core idea is to use nature’s creativity engine in our technology to make [it] do more than what [it] currently can. The real goal of a lot of this is to solve problems that humans don’t know how to solve and to exploit the power of evolution and computers.

      "snippet": "For two decades, law enforcement agencies and defense attorneys in high-profile cases have turned with confidence to Lee for scientific answers. But this week, in the Phil Spector murder trial, Lee was identified as part of a serious problem.\n\nThe judge in that case concluded that Lee hid or destroyed evidence from the scene of an actress's death, evidence that the prosecution contends was potentially damaging to the music producer's case.\n\n#### Don't Miss\n\nLee, who denied the allegation at a hearing last week, has not responded publicly to the findings of Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler. His assistant in Connecticut, where he is the emeritus chief of the state police, wrote in an e-mail that Lee is out of the country lecturing until June and unreachable for comment. [...] When he testified before Fidler, Lee said he was astonished and insulted by claims by two former members of Spector's defense team that he had collected a small white object that was never turned over to prosecutors, as the law requires.\n\n\"I think my reputation [is] severely damaged,\" he said then.\n\nSpector's lawyers, who touted his appearance in opening statements, still plan to call Lee as their star forensic witness, even though prosecutors will be able to present the same evidence that convinced Fidler of misconduct to the jury weighing the murder charge against Spector. Prosecutors contend the missing evidence was a torn acrylic nail that proves the actress, Lana Clarkson, did not commit suicide. [...] \"It's like a highly regarded movie director making a dud. Steven Spielberg survived '1941.' He made 'Jaws' before. He made 'Schindler's List' after. People will keep hiring Henry Lee,\" Goldman said.\n\nA year ago, prosecutors in Lucas County, Ohio, called on Lee to testify about bloodstain evidence at the trial of a Catholic priest, the Rev. Gerald Robinson, accused of murdering a nun in Toledo. Robinson was convicted.\n\nAsked if he would use Lee as an expert witness again given the developments in the Spector case, Christopher Anderson, the deputy chief prosecutor of the criminal division, hesitated."
