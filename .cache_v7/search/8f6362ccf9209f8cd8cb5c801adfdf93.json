      "snippet": "Amortized costs Billing data is always presented on a cash basis. It represents the amount that AWS charges you each month. For example, if you purchase a one-year, all-upfront Savings Plan in September, AWS will charge you the full cost for that Savings Plan in the September billing period. Your billing data will then include the full cost of that Savings Plan in September. This helps you understand, validate, and pay your AWS invoices on time. [...] In contrast, you can use Cost Explorer data to view amortized costs. When costs are amortized, an upfront charge is spread, or amortized over the life of that agreement. In the previous example, you can use Cost Explorer for an amortized view of your Savings Plan. A one-year, all-upfront Savings Plan purchase will be spread evenly across the 12 months of the commitment term. Use amortized costs to gain insight into the eﬀective daily costs associated with your portfolio of reservations or Savings Plans.\nAWS service grouping With billing data, your AWS charges are grouped into AWS services on your invoice. To help with deep-dive analysis, Cost Explorer will group some costs diﬀerently.

      "snippet": "## Using the advanced options when setting cost budgets\n\nCost budgets can be aggregated by blended, unblended, net unblended, amortized, or net amortized costs. Cost budgets can also either include or exclude refunds, credits, upfront reservation fees, recurring reservation charges, non-reservation subscription costs, taxes, and support charges.\n\n## Understanding the AWS Budgets update frequency\n\nAWS billing data, which Budgets uses to monitor resources, is updated at least once per day. Keep in mind that budget information and associated alerts are updated and sent according to this data refresh cadence.\n\n## Setting budget alerts [...] Maintain active monitoring. Custom period budgets don't auto-renew and expire on the end date. Regularly review your budgets and extend end dates as needed to ensure continuous monitoring.\n Consider your billing cycle. Align your custom period budget with your billing cycle for more accurate tracking.\n Use with other budget types. Combine custom period budgets with monthly, quarterly, or annual budgets for comprehensive financial monitoring. [...] Set an appropriate budget time frame. Choose a start and end date that aligns with your budgeting cycle. The end date must be within three years of the start date.\n Understand your budget calculations. Budget tracking uses the full date range, from start to end. For amount calculations, only the date (00:00 UTC) is used. The start date is included, but the end date is excluded from calculations.\n Optimize your forecast alerts. You can set forecasts up to 3 years in the future. Forecasting begins when the current date is within 12 months of the end date. Alert triggers are restricted to this 12-month time frame."

      "snippet": "Amortized costs: This cost metric reflects the effective cost of the upfront and monthly reservation fees spread across the billing period. By default, Cost Explorer shows the fees for Reserved Instances as a spike on the day that you're charged. However, if you choose to show costs as amortized costs, the costs are amortized over the billing period. This means that the costs are broken out into the effective daily rate. AWS estimates your amortized costs by combining your unblended costs with the amortized portion of your upfront and recurring reservation fees. For the daily view, Cost Explorer shows the unused portion of your upfront reservation fees and recurring RI charges on the first of the month. [...] Amortized costs aren't available for billing periods before 2018. If you want to see how much of your reservation was unused, group by purchase option.\n    Blended costs: This cost metric reflects the average cost of usage across the consolidated billing family. If you use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations, you can view costs using blended rates. For more information, see Blended Rates and Costs.\n    Net unblended costs: This cost metric reflects the cost after discounts.\n    Net amortized costs: This cost metric amortizes the upfront and monthly reservation fees while including discounts such as RI volume discounts.\n4. Under Additional data settings, select from the following: [...] For example, suppose that Alejandro purchases a Partial Upfront `t2.micro` RI for a one-year term at $30 dollars upfront. The monthly fee is $2.48. Cost Explorer shows the costs for this RI as a spike on the first of the month. If Alejandro chooses Amortized costs for a 30-day month, the Cost Explorer chart shows a daily effective rate of $0.165. This is the EC2 effective rate multiplied by the number of hours in a day."

      "snippet": "| CO:03 | Collect and review cost data. Data collection should capture daily costs. In cost reports, include incurred costs (metered), prepaid costs (amortized), trends, and forecasts. Stakeholders should regularly review spending against the budget and cost model. Automate alerts to trigger notifications at key thresholds and detect anomalies to indicate deviations from trend baselines. |\n --- |\n\nThis guide describes the recommendations for collecting and reviewing cost data for your workload. Gather cost data to paint a holistic picture of your workload and ensure spending is optimized. Data collection includes all indicators of cost optimization, like billing data, resource utilization, and usage patterns. [...] Provide comprehensive reports. Cost reports should include the cost of cloud services and vendors. The report should include costs incurred (invoiced), prepaid costs (amortized), trends, forecasts, credits, and cost variance. In both showback and chargeback systems, cost reports should include the following elements: [...] Incurred costs: Incurred costs refer to the actual costs accrued based on metered usage. These costs are calculated based on the consumption of resources or services within a specific billing period.\n Prepaid costs: Prepaid costs are expenses paid in advance and are spread out over a specific period of time. These costs are typically amortized or allocated evenly over the duration of the prepaid period.\n Trends: Analyzing cost trends involves examining the historical data to identify patterns and changes in spending over time. This analysis helps you understand how costs fluctuate and identify any underlying factors."

      "snippet": "### View unused RI costs in Cost Analysis\n\nTo identify the potential cost that is currently being wasted each month for your reservation purchase, follow the steps below.\n\n1. In the Azure portal, navigate to Cost Analysis for the scope where your reservation is applied. For example, Cost Management + Billing > Cost Management > Cost Analysis.\n2. Add a filter for Pricing Model: Reservation.\n3. Select the Amortized Cost view.\n4. Set the granularity to Monthly.\n5. Set the time period to the current year or your reservation term.\n6. Set the chart type to Column (stacked).\n7. Group charges by Charge Type.\n8. Review the results for `unusedreservation` values.\n\n### View utilization in Reservations\n\nFor detailed instructions, see Optimize reservation use.\n\n## View costs for a specific tag [...] Amortized cost - Shows a reservation purchase spread as an amortized cost over the duration of the reservation term. Using the same example above, Cost Analysis shows a varying cost for each month throughout the year, because of the varying number of days in a month. If you group costs by VM in this example, you'd see cost attributed to each VM that received the reservation benefit.\n\n## View your reservation utilization\n\nAfter you buy a reservation, it's important to track its utilization so that you get what you paid for. For example, if you bought 10 VMs for a year and only use five of them, then essentially half of the purchase is wasted. There are two different ways to assess your utilization:\n\n### View unused RI costs in Cost Analysis [...] 1. In the Azure portal, navigate to Cost Analysis for your scope. For example, Cost Management + Billing > Cost Management > Cost Analysis.\n2. Add a filter for Pricing Model: Reservation.\n3. Under Scope and next to the cost shown, select the down arrow symbol, select either Actual cost or Amortized cost metric.\n\nEach metric affects how data is shown for your reservation charges.\n\nActual cost - Shows the purchase as it appears on your bill. For example, if you bought a one-year reservation for $1200 in January, Cost Analysis shows a $1200 cost in the month of January for the reservation. It doesn't show a reservation cost for other months of the year. If you group your actual costs by VM, then a VM that received the reservation benefit for a given month would have zero cost for the month."

      "snippet": "## Establishing cost reporting and monitoring processes\n\nStart with identifying the types of costs that are important for internal stakeholders (for example, daily spend, cost by account, cost by X, amortized costs). By doing so, you can mitigate budgetary risks associated with unexpected or anomalous spend faster than waiting for the finalized AWS invoice. Tags provide the attribution that enables these reporting scenarios. Insights gained from reporting can inform your actions to mitigate the impact from anomalous and unexpected spend on financial budgets. When there is an unexpected surge in costs, it's important to evaluate if there has been an unexpected surge in the value delivered so that you can determine if and what action is required. [...] A common example of cost category that cannot be tagged is some fees for commitment-based discounts such as Reserved Instances (RI) and Savings Plans (SP). While subscription fees and unused SP and RI fees cannot be tagged in advance of appearing in billing reporting tools, you can track how RI and SP discounts apply to accounts, resources and their tags in AWS Organizations after the fact. For example, in AWS Cost Explorer it’s possible to look at the amortized cost, group that spend by the relevant tag keys and apply filters relevant to your use case. In AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR), you can filter out lines that correspond to usage covered by RI and SP discounts (read more in the use cases section of the CUR documentation) and select the columns that are only relevant to you.
