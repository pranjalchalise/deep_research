      "snippet": "# Pierce vs Maguire\n\nJoin Britain’s longest running political double act, the Mail’s Andrew Pierce and Kevin Maguire from the Mirror for their weekly, no holds barred, take on Westminster, the Royals and usually, The Donald. There’s no fence to sit on so expect fireworks!\n\n## Episodes\n\n6D AGO\n\n### Episode 22. Is Braverman The New 'Bastard'? [...] 2025-12-22\n\n### Episode18. Who's Been Naughty Or Nice?\n\nSorry for the thumbnail, this is what you get when you ask AI to create a Pierce vs Maguire Xmas image! World domination by big tech is a while off. This is our bumper Christmas report card on the heroes and villains, the legends and losers, the prize recipients of another astonishing year at Westminster, Royal Lodge and Mar-a-Lago, all with no punches pulled. And thanks for you support since our launch just four months ago, last week Pierce vs Maguire was hovering just outside the top ten politics podcasts in the UK. We never forget you have a choice but none of the others are as funny, outspoken nor as well informed as these two Santa's little helpers.\n\n2025-12-17\n\n### Episode 17. Should Medics Lose The Right To Strike? [...] ### Episode 15. (Prince) Andrew Ruins It For Royal Rent\n\nHow much should the Royals pay in rent for their stately homes? Wouldn't have been an issue until Mr Mountbatten Windsor cosied up to paedophile Epstein and now a committee of MPs wants to scrutinise all royals paying peppercorns for Palaces. Also in this episode, they think its OBR, it is now - how long can Rachel survive.? The anti semitic rhetoric of Corbyn and Sultanas new left wing Your Party, unless You're Jewish, we presume. And Andrew gets a lesson on Elf on the Shelf, that's Pierce not Windsor!\n\n## About\n\n## Information\n\n## You Might Also Like\n\nExplicit, Where Politics Meets History\n\nUpdated Weekly\n\nElectoral Dysfunction\n\nUpdated Weekly\n\nPolitical Currency\n\nUpdated Weekly\n\nThe News Agents\n\nUpdated Daily\n\nTalking Politics"
