The chief executive of the company behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot has warned companies against aggressive hiring after making AI-driven layoffs. He has advised companies to take a more cautious approach to workforce expansion as AI capabilities continue to advance.In a recently live-streamed town hall event (seen by Business Insider), Altman said, “What I think we shouldn't do, and what I hope other companies won't do either, is hire super aggressively, then realise all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation. So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.” [...] Comments\n\nShare\n\nAA\n\nText Size\n\n Small\n Medium\n Large\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman advises companies against rapid hiring, citing AI's growing capabilities.

      "snippet": "Seven years later, he has matured; his scholarly vibe has grown stronger, and he seems to have become even more introverted. From giving up his well-paying career (in software engineering) to becoming a journalist, he has found his passion after wandering around (I hear he still lives as a digital nomad now). He knows many Silicon Valley celebrities, but maintains independent thinking and a healthy skepticism of fame.\n\nI can sense that we both admire the spirit of Silicon Valley: a pursuit of innovation (“better to be a pirate than join the navy”), a desire to make a difference, direct communication, and a disdain for certain mediocre, lumbering giants. [...] His motivations may still be up for debate, and I personally disagree with technological accelerationism, but it’s worth learning from his efforts to help people and unite them. Understanding that every individual is a complex being, striving to find people’s shining points, and bringing out their best — this is a valuable approach to both life and character. In comparison, my previous approach of “clear love and hate,” judging people in black and white, deserves some reflection. [...] Stay ambitious. Whether taking over Y Combinator (with some even saying “under Sam’s leadership, YC’s ambition increased tenfold”) or founding OpenAI in 2015, when Google and DeepMind were far ahead in AI, or the global vision mentioned earlier, Sam’s actions go far beyond what a typical founder would imagine or accomplish. I remember being surprised the first time I read about his “Moore’s Law of Everything” because it almost seemed like a political utopian manifesto. Whatever the case, he is indeed trying to do what he claims: “One big secret is that you can change the world largely according to your will. Most people haven’t even tried.”"
