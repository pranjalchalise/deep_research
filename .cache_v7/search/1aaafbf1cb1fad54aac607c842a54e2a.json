      "snippet": "#### 7.1.1 Final remarks\n\nBNNs represent a compelling advancement in the development of uncertainty-aware autonomous systems. Their ability to couple predictive accuracy with transparent risk estimation makes them highly promising for deployment in next-generation intelligent mobility solutions. By enabling resilient, interpretable, and cautious behavior, BNNs contribute to safer navigation, trustworthy autonomy, and the broader goal of sustainable, human-centered transportation systems.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\n## Author contributions [...] • Combine real-world datasets (for example, KITTI) with physically-inspired data augmentation;\n\n• Quantify the safety and interpretability benefits of BNNs in end-to-end decision-making.\n\n### 2.5 This Study’s contributions\n\nTo address these gaps, we:\n\n• Apply BNNs beyond classification to trajectory prediction and decision-making;\n\n• Introduce a unified framework evaluated in three case studies spanning urban, obstacle-rich, and weather-degraded scenarios;\n\n• Compare performance against deterministic baselines and analyze results through both statistical metrics and uncertainty visualization.\n\nThe study's contributions are illustrated in Tables 1, 2 and Figures 1–8.\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. SSIM scores across weather conditions.\n\nTable 2\n\nTable 2. BNN prediction accuracy across conditions. [...] • Inference Time: Sampling increases computation.\n\n• Data Dependency: Performance hinges on variability and realism in training data.\n\n• Sim-to-Real Gaps: While synthetic results are encouraging, real-world transferability needs further testing.\n\n#### 4.6.2 Future work\n\nNext steps involve:\n\n• Integrating BNNs into full-stack simulation (for example, CARLA).\n\n• Leveraging multimodal inputs (camera, LIDAR, radar) for richer inference.\n\n• Dynamically adapting risk thresholds via reinforcement learning.\n\n#### 4.6.3 Reproducibility\n\nAll code, simulation setups, and evaluation scripts are available upon request and will be hosted on GitHub.\n\n## 5 Case study 2: obstacle avoidance\n\n### 5.1 Simulation context and synthetic dataset generation"
