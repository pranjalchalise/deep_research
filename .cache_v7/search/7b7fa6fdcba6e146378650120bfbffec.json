      "snippet": "## Python characteristics\n\n  \nPythons are huge snakes that belong to the genus Python. They have unique physical and behavioural traits. Their jaws are narrow, their bodies are muscular, and they feature heat-sensing pits and flexible jaws as natural hunting tools. Moreover, pythons have two lungs—a primitive feature that descended from reptiles that resemble lizards. This enables them to squeeze through tight crevices and swallow larger prey. They can survive for more than 20 years in the wild and more than 20 years in captivity. Certain species, like the ball python, are popular in the pet trade because of their long lifespans and peaceful personalities.  \n\n## Python diet [...] The magnificent serpents of the genus Python, known as pythons, captivate people's attention with their remarkable size and unique characteristics. These snakes are some of the biggest in the world and are well-known for their massive physical presence.   \nTheir muscular bodies are built for effective constriction. They are skilled predators and adept camouflage due to their amazing ability to coil tightly around prey and their unique skin patterns that blend flawlessly into their surroundings. [...] The African rock python, Reticulated python, Burmese python, Ball python, Carpet python, Green tree python, Indian python, and Blood python are among the species of pythons. With some species growing up to 20 feet long, the reticulated python is the longest snake in the world. Large, heavy-bodied Burmese pythons can be found in the Everglades National Park, grasslands, and marshes of Southeast Asia."

      "snippet": "The Pythonidae, commonly known as pythons, are a family \"Family (biology)\") of nonvenomous snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Ten genera and 39 species are currently recognized. Being naturally non-venomous, pythons must constrict their prey to induce cardiac arrest prior to consumption. Pythons will typically strike at and bite their prey of choice to gain hold of it; they then must use physical strength to constrict their prey, by coiling their muscular bodies around the animal, effectively suffocating it before swallowing whole. This is in stark contrast to venomous snakes such as the rattlesnake, for example, which delivers a swift, venomous bite but releases, waiting as the prey succumbs to envenomation before [...] Pythons are indigenous to the Old World Tropics, including sub-Saharan Africa, tropical to subtropical Asia, and Australia, Pythons are ambush predators that primarily kill prey by constriction, causing cardiac arrest. Pythons are oviparous, laying eggs that females incubate until they hatch. They possess premaxillary teeth, with the exception of adults in the Australian genus Aspidites. While many species are available in the exotic pet trade, caution is needed with larger species due to potential danger. The taxonomy of pythons has evolved, and they are now known to be more closely related to sunbeam snakes and the Mexican burrowing python. [citation needed] [...] Most members of this family are ambush predators, in that they typically remain motionless in a camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at passing prey. Attacks on humans, although known to occur, are extremely rare.\n\n## Feeding\n\n[edit]\n\nPythons use their sharp, backward-curving teeth, four rows in the upper jaw, two in the lower, to grasp prey which is then killed by constriction; after an animal has been grasped to restrain it, the python quickly wraps a number of coils around it. Death occurs primarily by cardiac arrest. Even the larger species, such as the reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), do not crush their prey to death."

      "snippet": "Most pythons are terrestrial to semiarboreal, and a few, such as the green tree python (Morelia viridis) of Australia and New Guinea, are strongly arboreal. Terrestrial pythons are regularly found near water and are proficient swimmers, but they hunt and eat almost exclusively on land. Larger pythons prey mainly on mammals and birds; smaller species also eat amphibians and reptiles. Pythons have good senses of smell and sight, and most can also detect heat. Pits lying between the lip scales have receptors that are sensitive to infrared radiation and enable pythons to “see” the heat shadow of mammals and birds even during the darkest night. Prey is captured by striking and biting, usually followed by constriction. When swallowing prey, pythons secrete a mucus that contains harmless trace [...] Pythons are egg layers (oviparous) rather than live-bearers (viviparous). Females of most, if not all, species coil around the eggs, and some actually brood them. Brooders select thermally stable nesting sites, then lay their eggs and coil around them so that the eggs are in contact only with the female’s body. When the air temperature begins to drop, she generates heat by shivering in a series of minuscule muscle contractions and thus maintains an elevated and fairly constant incubation temperature.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAnimal Group Names\n\n## Old world pythons [...] Eight species of genus Python live in sub-Saharan Africa and from India to southern China into Southeast Asia, including the Philippines and the Moluccas islands of Indonesia. Other related genera inhabit New Guinea and Australia. Some Australian pythons (genus Liasis) never grow much longer than one metre, but some pythons of Africa (P. sebae), India (P. molurus), Southeast Asia and Java (P. bivittatus), New Guinea (L. papuanus), and Australia (L. amethistinus) regularly exceed 3 metres (10 feet). Despite their large size, some of these species survive in urban and suburban areas, where their secretive habits and recognized value as rat catchers par excellence serve to protect them. The Burmese python (P. bivittatus) also occurs in large numbers in southern Florida in North America,"

      "snippet": "The first thing to note is that the anaconda is a species of boa, not a separate type of snake. That leaves two groups: the pythons and the boas. These snakes are constrictors, killing their prey by wrapping around it and suffocating it. And they are considered primitive snakes with two lungs (most snakes have only one) and the remnants of hind legs and pelvic bones. But they have differences, too.\n\nPythons have one more bone in their head than boas do and some additional teeth. And pythons are found in the Old World (Africa, Asia, Australia) while boas live in both the Old World and the New World (North, Central, and South America). But the biggest difference is that pythons lay eggs while boas give birth to live young. [...] Like most snakes, pythons don’t chase after their prey. Instead, they are ambush hunters. They use both sight and smell to locate prey. Pythons also have an additional advantage: most have special temperature-sensitive \"pits,” or holes, along their jaws that can sense the heat of a nearby animal. This helps them find warm-blooded prey even in the dark or among dense foliage. [...] Arboreal pythons have unusually longer teeth than their ground-dwelling kin. This may help them penetrate through the feathers of birds. Their tail is also extremely prehensile, allowing these snakes to launch three quarters or more of their body at prey during a strike.\n\n## FAMILY LIFE\n\nUnlike their close relatives the boas, pythons lay eggs. Some lay them in a shallow nest or even cover them with leaves and soil. But what’s really remarkable is that most python mothers stay coiled around their eggs to protect them while the eggs develop; if the temperature gets too cold, the mothers of some species warm their eggs up by \"shivering.” This involves rhythmic contractions of the muscles and is described as looking like the snake has the hiccups. This is known as thermogenesis."

      "snippet": "Pythons are an egg laying species. Females of small species, such as the pygmy python, lay up to ten eggs at a time. Larger females, such as the reticulated python, may lay more than one hundred. The eggs usually stick together in a clump. Females coil their bodies around the eggs, which protects them from other animals and keeps them warm. Some mothers can even heat up their bodies during this time by tightening and loosening the muscles. Occasionally, a female may leave the eggs while she goes out to sunbathe and then return to wrap the eggs in her heated body. Once the eggs hatch, the baby snakes usually look much like the adults, although they are sometimes more brightly colored.\n\n## Additional topics [...] When they feel threatened, many will hiss, ooze a bad-smelling material from the vent area at the beginning of the tail, and possibly strike and/or bite. The ball python gets its name because it curls up in a ball when it feels it is in danger.\n\nPythons are mostly active at night, although they often will sunbathe, or bask, during the daytime in a warm spot. One species, the diamond python of Australia, hibernates, or enters a deep sleep, during the winter to survive the cold months. Scientists know little more about python behavior.
