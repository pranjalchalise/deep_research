      "snippet": "As a leader in open‑source agent development, LangChain’s bread and butter is building, orchestrating, and deploying agents seamlessly for developers and non‑technical users alike. To advance this mission, Brace Sproul, Head of Applied AI, and his team built a cloud‑hosted coding agent that runs autonomously end to end. To open-source it reliably, they needed to nail one thing: their sandbox partner. [...] #### If anybody asked me which runtime platform to use, I'm going to 100% say Daytona every time. With their SDK, we never have to worry about an agent leaking or taking actions that it shouldn't. I haven't seen this anywhere else.\n\nBrace Sproul\n\nHead of Applied AI at LangChain\n\n###### MORE CUSTOMER STORIES\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona\n\n##### How Stanford’s CS Department Accelerates Open-Source Agent Development With Daytona##### How Orchids Powers the World's First AI Full-Stack Engineer With Daytona\n\n##### How Orchids Powers the World's First AI Full-Stack Engineer With Daytona [...] And the team doesn’t stop at attentive support. They continuously evolve the platform based on LangChain’s feedback. By actively seeking input and implementing improvements quickly, Daytona keeps LangChain focused on their core projects and pushes them further ahead in the fast-moving AI space.\n\n#### The fact that Daytona is always so engaged and responsive is one of the main reasons why we chose them.

Sproul, and Michael Horton, have expressed similar views.47 Such thinking has led some theologians to argue in favor of transhumanism. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a 20th century Jesuit priest and paleontologist, argued that creation was not an event in time but rather a constant process of God’s work in the world. 45.

Isaac Asimov popularized the idea of personal robots in his 1950 story I, Robot. More recent films like Her and Ex Machina have portrayed AI in modern settings that make it easy for us to envision ourselves interacting with it. We already experience interaction with limited AI programs like Siri and Google Assistant. The transhumanist vision goes beyond these simple tools. Ben Goertzel distinguishes a class of AI called “AGI:” artificial general intelligence, which he defines as “intelligences capable of coping with unpredictable situations in intelligent and creative ways.”115 Goertzel predicts that we will see the creation of true AGI by the year 2050, if not well before. According to Goertzel, [...] “Synthetic intellects will soon know more about you than your mother does, be able to predict your behavior better than you can, and warn you of dangers you can’t even perceive.”121 These systems will “accomplish physical tasks that people consider routine” and “tirelessly perform an astonishing range of chores in chaotic, dynamic environments.”122 In other words, advancement in AI will free us from menial labor, which means less drudgery and discontent, and take our place in 118.
