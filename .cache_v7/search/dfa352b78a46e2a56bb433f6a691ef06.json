      "title": "Top 10 Renewable Energy Trends & Innovations in 2022",
      "snippet": "The innovations in these renewable sources focus on energy converters and component improvements for harvesting energy more efficiently. Within hydropower, small-scale hydroelectric dams and tidal barrages enable decentralized energy generation. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OETC) harnesses energy through the thermal gradient created between the surface and deep water. Few startups are also converting the salinity gradient formed due to the osmotic pressure difference between seawater and river into usable energy.\n\n5. Wind Energy [...] Due to concerns regarding discharging, safety, and environmental pollution, startups are devising batteryless storage alternatives such as pumped hydro and compressed air technologies. On the other hand, surplus energy is converted to other forms of energy such as heat or methane for storage and reconversion through Power-to-X (P2X) technology.\n\n4. Ocean thermal energy conversion\n\nHydropower is the energy derived from moving water. Unlike solar and wind, hydro energy is predictable and, hence, more reliable. Besides, hydroelectric dams, as well as ocean-based energy harnessed from tides, currents, and waves, offer high energy density while reducing dependency on conventional sources. [...] Although renewable energies such as solar, wind, and hydroelectricity have been around for a long time, recent rapid innovations make these some of the most trending technologies. Moreover, they dominate the industry due to their competitive advantages. Relatively newer areas of research in the renewable sector include energy from green hydrogen and water energy forms such as tidal, wave, and ocean currents.\n\nTake a look at 10 renewable energy innovations that will hit 2022:\n\n1. Advanced Photovoltaics (PV)\n\nSolar companies are integrating PV systems with every aspect of our surroundings while minimizing the need for additional land usage. As a result, integrated PV, photovoltaics, and agrivoltaics are logical shifts in trends."
