The Dominant Evangelical Definition of Inerrancy\n\nTo this day, most evangelical denominations, seminaries, and ministries define inerrancy using language derived directly from Chicago. It became the standard reference point for discussions of biblical authority.\n\n### 2. The Rise of Apologetics and Hermeneutical Precision\n\nThe statement sparked a wave of books, conferences, and scholarly work—especially by Norman Geisler, R. C. Sproul, and later younger theologians—devoted to Scripture’s reliability.\n\n### 3. Guardrails Against Doctrinal Drift\n\nBecause the statement includes both affirmations and denials, it has functioned as a boundary-marker, shaping evangelical identity and theology for decades.\n\n### 4.

Emerging from decades of debate over the nature of Scripture, the Chicago Statement marked a major moment in the late-20th-century effort to define and defend the authority of the Bible. Understanding its development requires appreciating the intellectual, cultural, and ecclesial tensions that gave rise to it. [...] ## Conclusion\n\nThe Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy was more than a document—it was a milestone in the struggle to articulate and preserve the authority of Scripture in a time of significant cultural and theological change. Born out of decades of conflict, crafted by some of evangelicalism’s most influential thinkers, and still widely cited today, the statement continues to shape conversations about the nature of the Bible and the identity of evangelical faith.\n\nBecome a patron at Patreon!\n\n## Post navigation\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

      "snippet": "The following Statement affirms this inerrancy of Scripture afresh, making clear our understanding of it and warning against its denial. We are persuaded that to deny it is to set aside the witness of Jesus Christ and of the Holy Spirit and to refuse that submission to the claims of God's own Word which marks true Christian faith. We see it as our timely.duty to make this affirmation in the face of current lapses from the truth of inerrancy among our fellow Christians and misunderstanding of this doctrine in the world at large.\nThis Statement consists of three parts: a Summary Statement, Articles of Affirmation and Denial, and an accompanying Exposition.\nIt has been prepared in the course of a three-day consultation in Chicago. [...] Such are the agnosticism which denies that -God is knowable, the rationalism which denies that He is in-comprehensible, the idealism which denies that He is transcendent, and the existentialism which denies ra-tionality in His relationships with us. When these un- and anti-biblical principles seep into men's theologies at presuppositional level, as today they frequently do, faithful interpretation of Holy Scripture becomes im-possible.\n~ \"\"\" \"\"\"\"\",,, -The original document is located in the Dallas Theological Seminary Archives.\nII ,.,-------..-...\n-..\n-111 III . [...] We deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science.\nWe further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creatio.n and the flood.\nArticle XIII We affirm the propriety of using inerrancy as a theological term with reference to the complete truthful-ness ofScripture.\n."

      "snippet": "People have been saying that for years. Packer wrote an interesting article on this point where he said that inerrancy really is a shibboleth in a positive sense. This is a doctrine that unbelievers of the authority of the Word of God choke on. They have a hard time signing confessions of faith that include that language. They'll say they believe in the relevance, or the trustworthiness, or the organic inspiration, and so on like that; but when you push it to the point of whether God inspires error, they get really nervous. So it has been a watershed test for a lot of people. We're living in a time now where these younger people have been deluged by a cultural approach to truth that is relativistic and pluralistic, and the strong stand that an inerrantist takes about the objectivity of [...] I'm concerned today that a lot of younger evangelical Christians–pastors and leaders who didn't go through that period–haven't actually read the Chicago Statement. They are rejecting inerrancy because they were raised in fundamentalist churches. For example, a well-known pastor in Dallas says that every word in Scripture, every syllable, is the utterance of God, not man, that there is no human element at all in Scripture. The Chicago Statement, however, addresses all of this and it's clearly different from fundamentalism. How do you respond to younger evangelicals today who say that inerrancy is an unnecessarily divisive issue that ties us down to positions we don't need to be tied down to in the church? [...] As I said earlier, the two doctrines that have been the cement for evangelical unity, crossing denominations for centuries, have been the doctrine of Scripture on the one hand and the doctrine of justification by faith on the other. At that time in the early 1980s, I was witnessing the unraveling of the unity over Scripture. I never dreamed in a million years that I would see a similar unraveling with respect to sola fide, which came shortly thereafter. But people from various denominations and seminaries were very concerned about the advances being made by higher criticism against the classical doctrine of Scripture. It created a crisis in the Southern Baptist Convention, and so the Chicago Statement was very important to the deliberations going on in the Southern Baptist Convention, as"

      "snippet": "THE CHICAGO STATEMENT ON BIBLICAL HERMENEUTICS Summit I of the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy took place in Chicago on October 26-28, 1978 for the purpose of affirming afresh the doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture, making clear the understanding of it and warning against its denial. In the seven years since Summit I, God has blessed that effort in ways surpassing most anticipations. A gratifying show of helpful literature on the doctrine of inerran-cy as well as a growing commitment to its value give cause to pour forth praise to our great God. [...] That is the purpose this exposition seeks to serve.\nWhat it offers is basic perspectives on the hermeneutical task in the light of three convictions. First, Scripture, being God's own instruction to us, is abidingly true and utterly trustworthy. Second, hermeneutics is crucial to the battle for biblical authority in the contemporary church. Third, as knowledge of the inerrancy of Scripture must control interpretation, forbidding us to discount anything that Scripture proves to affirm, so interpretation must clarify the scope and significance of that inerrancy by determining what affirmations Scripture actually makes."

      "snippet": "The twentieth century has seen many attempts to assert the instrumentality of Scripture in bringing to us God’s Word while yet denying that that Word has been set forth for all time in the words of the biblical text. These views regard the text as the fallible human witness by means of which God fashions and prompts those insights which he gives us through preaching and Bible study. But for the most part these views include a denial that the Word of God is cognitive communication, and thus they lapse inescapably into impressionistic mysticism. Also, their denial that Scripture is the objectively given Word of God makes the relation of that Word to the text indefinable and hence permanently problematical. This is true of all current forms of neo-orthodox and existentialist theology, [...] Article XIII.WE AFFIRM the propriety of using inerrancy as a theological term with reference to the complete truthfulness of Scripture. WE DENY that it is proper to evaluate Scripture according to standards of truth and error that are alien to its usage or purpose. We further deny that inerrancy is negated by Biblical phenomena such as a lack of modern technical precision, irregularities of grammar or spelling, observational descriptions of nature, the reporting of falsehoods, the use of hyperbole and round numbers, the topical arrangement of material, variant selections of material in parallel accounts, or the use of free citations.

      "snippet": "an inerrant Bible does us little good till we know how to interpret it, and interpretation involves applying biblical truth to the realities of contemporary life. [...] THE CHICAGO STATEMENT ON BIBLICAL APPLICATION This statement is the third and final in a trilogy of Summits sponsored by the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy.\nSummit I (October 26-28, 1978) produced the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy.\nSummit II (November 10-13, 1982) resulted in the Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics.\nThis last conference, Summit III (December 10-13, 1986),drafted the Chicago Statement on Biblical Application. With this statement the proposed scholarly work of ICBI has been completed, for the doctrine of inerrancy has thus been defined, interpreted, and applied by many of the leading evangelical scholars of our day. [...] The proper way to pose the hermeneutical ques-tion that is central in contemporary debate is to ask what it is in us, and in our culture, that keeps us from hearing God's unchanging Word of judgment, mercy, repentance and righteousness, as it applies to us and to our own situation. When the question is posed in this way, the door is opened to the Word of God making its proper impact on us, which otherwise it could hardly do. The form of this impact will vary from one time and place to another, for it is right that the Word should in-digenize itself in every distinct culture that the human family produces; but the substance of the impact, that is, the demand for repentance and faith in Christ, wor-ship and holiness before God, and love and justice The original document is located in the"
