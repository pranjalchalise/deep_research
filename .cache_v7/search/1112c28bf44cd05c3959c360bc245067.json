      "snippet": "The writing in this play sadly didn't lift off, but had its moments of sparkle on an intermittent basis. More specifically, it holds a mirror up to couples whereby the power-dynamic is evident: Ray is clearly threatened by Sylvia's standing in life, and I found that ought to have been explored more. The conviction of Vasan and Dunster as the couple provides a believable portrayal of straight relationships, despite the reality lived being somewhat lacklustre and beyond the imagination. Vasan stands out as the strongest actor (most recently seen in Wicked Little Letters and opposite Paul Mescal in A Streetcar Named Desire) and Dunster's (Ted Lasso) portrayal of Ray is satisfactory thouugh I note that his accent switches between two resulting in lack of considered consistency. There's a [...] Overall, this is a show that shines a light on a honeymoon gone wrong (how many people do you know have had their plane en route to honeymoon hijacked?), and its lasting impact on the survivors. It could have benefitted from a sharp edit of the plot points and more attention paid to the dialogue. The 'pilot' of this show needed a Sylvia-esque rescue, but sadly it’s too far-fetched a plot failed to bring any sense of momentum for a sustained period.\n\nUntil 9 November 2024 only | \n\nThanks for reading Hamza Jahanzeb! This post is public so feel free to share it.\n\nShare [...] Sylvia (Anjana Vasan) and Ray (Phil Dunster) are two lovers at the heart of the latest drama to grace (brace? SORRY) the upstairs space of the Royal Court. It details the story of lovers as they survive a plane hijacking, and have to decide how they will move on with their lives after one of them really did help to save the entire aircraft of crew and passengers. Ideally, I'd love to have seen a one-woman play with Sylvia as a matter of fact (the heroine in all of this), and her grounded. Instead, Forsyth chooses to splay the dialogue across the couple with a third actor to play several roles, including the Hijacker himself (played terrifyingly by Craige Els)."

      "snippet": "Yet despite the unconvincing plotting, the production, directed by Daniel Raggett and designed by Anna Reid with Paul Arditti’s gripping soundscape, does have an impact. The staging is vividly abstract, with a sinister pit and a runway strip that acts also as the interior of the plane and a metaphor for PTSD taking off. And what a cast! Ted Lasso’s Phil Dunster and Wicked Little Letters’ Anjana Vasan have great onstage chemistry, and the fractured quality of the story’s construction means that you don’t notice the rapidity of the shifts in their characters’ psychology. They are well supported by Craige Els (pictured above), who plays several roles. But in the end Brace Brace is just a work in progress.\n\n@AleksSierz\n\n## Add comment\n\n#### Plain text\n\n### rating\n\n### explore topics [...] Unbidden, the thought jumped into my mind: what do they know that I don’t know? Since then I have been horribly conscious of the fear of flying, and it is this anxiety that accelerates the emotional fuel of the dramatically titled Brace Brace, by Oli Forsyth, this year’s recipient of the Jerwood New Playwright award, and whose new play is being staged at the Royal Court’s suitably claustrophobic studio space. [...] Forsyth tackles this story with a confident theatricality that imbues the staging with a fierce energy. His Ray and Sylvia chat directly to the audience, contest each other’s memories and act out scenes from the trauma in a series of quick switches from one angle to another, likewise also switching from anxiety to anger to comedy to seriousness. While this vigorous writing works well in grabbing our attention, the big questions – mental health, personal choices, false memory, survivor’s guilt, vengeful feelings, conspiracy theories – are introduced, but regrettably remain unexplored. The implausibility of the scenario spreads to the moral themes. Lots of things are mentioned, none are deeply thought through."

      "snippet": "The play, which is based on Forsyth’s personal experience, explores the aftermath of trauma, and how we come to terms with it, with resonant detail. Sylvia’s insistence that the hijacker is lying about his mental health butts up against Ray’s need to believe it was an unfortunate accident (“a plane fell out of the sky, and we happened to be on it”). Both positions feel like a denial of reality, even though both are undeniable. What does seem clear is that neither of them receives adequate support (the airline sends them a few thousand pounds and two free plane tickets).

[...] Sylvia (Anjana Vasan) and Ray (Phil Dunster) are a familiar young couple; she a digital marketer, he a wannabe comedian-turned-teacher, who meet at a house party and marry soon after. But their giddy romance is shattered when, en route to their honeymoon, the plane suddenly plummets towards the sea at the hands of a crazed passenger (Craige Els).\n\nThis incident, which arrives quite early on, is staged with visceral immersiveness, on a large illuminated catwalk cutting through the middle of the stage, with rows of lights flanking the traverse seating like porthole windows. It’s a real coup de theatre and huge plaudits belong to director Daniel Raggett and the creative team, including Anna Reid (designer), Simeon Miller (lighting) and Paul Arditti (sound)."

Both these products are ones I found that looked affordable to see if supports would be helpful.\n\nFor the first time in YEARS I slept without waking up to hip pain - that's because I slept in:  Low priced SI belt. As stated, I slept with this on over my clothes and it really helped keep my hips stable. I took it off to get dressed for work and I could feel a definite difference. It went back on. Though my muscles are a little unsure about all of this - or maybe I just don't know how to sit without pain? - it feels good to have on. [...] EDIT: About a week later and I do go times without the belt as I don't want to weaken what currently somewhat functions, but oh my gosh, what a difference. If you are thinking about it, try it! It might make a huge difference.\n\nToday I am also wearing:  Very affordable ankle wraps that give my feet nice support in my Brooks walking shoes. These are new today, but so far I like them a lot more than my compression sleeves, because they are adjustable.\n\nEDIT: Same for these braces. I am almost springing along in my daily work walk abouts, so I know this is making a difference.\n\nAnyone else have specific items that they use all the time?\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts"
