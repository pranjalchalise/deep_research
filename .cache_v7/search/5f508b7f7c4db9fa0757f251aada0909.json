      "snippet": "Just as in the accounting method, we must enforce an additional condition to ensure that the total amortized cost of a sequence is always an upper bound on the total actual cost. By equation 2, we can derive a relationship between the total amortized and actual costs: ∑ i=1 n  ci=∑ i=1 n ciDi−Di−1 (3) Note that all ( Φ Di) terms except ( Φ D0) and ( Φ Dn) cancel out, leaving: ∑ i=1 n  ci=∑ i=1 n ciDn−D0 (4) To ensure that the total amortized cost is an upper bound on the total actual cost, for a sequence of any length, we merely must ensure that Di≥D0for all i. Typically, ( Φ D0) is defined to be 0, and the potential is defined so that it is always non­negative (Cormen et al. 2001, p.413). [...] It can be shown that the amortized cost of any splay step on node x is O(log n). To provide this bound, we can enumerate all the possible changes to the tree that a single iteration of the SPLAY while­ loop might cause. Then, for each case, we compute the potential for the entire tree before and after the loop iteration, and the actual cost required to perform the iteration. This gives us a bound on the amortized cost of a single loop iteration, which we can then sum over all iterations of the loop to obtain a bound on the amortized cost of the entire SPLAY operation. [...] ● If good amortized cost is a goal, an algorithm may be designed to explicitly perform this “clean­ up” during expensive operations!\n● The key to performing amortized analysis is picking a good “credit” or “potential” function that captures how operations with different actual costs affect a data structure and allows the desired bounds to be shown."

      "title": "The rising costs of training frontier AI models - arXiv",
      "snippet": "It’s important to distinguish the amortized cost of the hardware used for training, which is spread over the useful lifetime of the hardware, and the acquisition cost of purchasing that hardware outright. The choice of which cost to consider depends on the purpose of the analysis. Amortized costs are more relevant for understanding the economics of training and deploying models over an extended period, while acquisition costs give a sense of the capital barriers to entry and financial risks involved in developing such models. [...] To illustrate the difference between amortized hardware cost and acquisition cost, Figure 4 shows the acquisition costs we were able to estimate using hardware purchase prices and training hardware quantities. Since this is the up-front cost of acquiring the hardware, the costs are one to two orders of magnitude larger than amortized hardware costs. For example, we estimate that it cost $800M to acquire the hardware used to train GPT-4, compared to $40M for the amortized hardware CapEx + energy cost. The ratio between the two depends on when and for how long the model is trained. Based on 40 estimates of acquisition cost, we find a growth rate of per year (95% CI: , ), which is similar to the growth in amortized costs. [...] The amortized training costs of frontier models have increased by a factor of 2.4x per year since 2016. This is the result of the preferred amortized hardware CapEex + energy approach, shown in Figure 2. Table 1 compares this to the cloud approach, which yields a similar growth rate of per year. The growth rate is also similar if we vary hardware depreciation or training start date within reasonable limits (see Section B.4). However, the growth rate rises to 2.9x per year if we exclude TPUs, which have more uncertain costs than publicly-sold GPUs."

We’ve prepaid (-n) previously. So, the cost is 1 (n+1–n).\n\n### Example 3: Dynamic Arrays\n\nLastly, let’s consider dynamic arrays, which resize by doubling their capacity when full. The worst-case time complexity for insertion is when you need to resize — increase the size to 2n, then copy n elements over to the new array. What is the cost of such data structure? Note we saw this kind of example in hash tables as well, where we do rehashing. Without amortized cost analysis. The worst case cost of n insert operations is O(n²).

Now, we are going to make this much more formal using a potential function. [...] Amortized Cost of Push and Pop: Each `push` operation takes 1 time and we can pay an extra 1 \"credit\" for future `pop` operations. Therefore, the amortized cost of `push` is 2 units.\n Amortized Cost of Pop: Since the `push` operation has prepaid for the `pop` operation, the amortized cost of `pop` is 0 units.\n Amortized Cost of PopAll: The `popAll` operation removes all elements from the stack, but since each `push` operation has prepaid for its eventual removal, the amortized cost of `popAll` is 0 units.\n\nThus, the amortized cost of each operation (`push`, `pop`, `popAll`) is 2 units. For n operations, it is only 2n in worst case!\n\n### Example 2: Incrementing a Binary Counter"

      "title": "Explaining Amortization in the Balance Sheet - Investopedia",
      "snippet": "Amortization occurs when the value of an intangible asset, such as research and development (R&D) or a trademark, is reduced over a specific time period, usually the asset's estimated useful life.\n\nA good way to think of this is to consider amortization to be the cost of an asset as it is consumed or used up while generating value for a company or government. Along with the useful life, major inputs into the amortization process include residual value and the allocation method, the last of which can be on a straight-line basis. [...] A more specialized case of amortization occurs when a bond purchased at a premium is amortized down to its par value as the bond reaches maturity. When a bond is purchased at a discount, the discount is reduced each period in a process known as accretion. The concept is again referring to adjusting value over time on the balance sheet, with the amortization amount reflected in the income statement.\n\nGenerally speaking, an asset can be amortized if its benefits will be realized over a period of several years or longer. With a shorter duration, such as days or months, it is probably best and most efficient to expense the cost through the income statement and not count the item as an asset at all. [...] ## The Bottom Line\n\nAmortization reflects the fact that intangible assets have a value that must be monitored and adjusted over time. The amortization concept is subject to classifications and estimates that need to be studied closely by a firm’s accountants and auditors, who must sign off on financial statements.\n\nArticle Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work. These include white papers, government data, original reporting, and interviews with industry experts. We also reference original research from other reputable publishers where appropriate.

      "snippet": "Amortization of capitalized costs on a “systematic basis” should take into account the expected timing of transfer of the goods and services related to the asset, which typically corresponds to the period and pattern in which revenue will be recognized in the financial statements. The pattern in which the related revenue is recognized could be significantly front-loaded, back-loaded, or seasonal, and costs should be amortized accordingly. [...] If the pattern in which the contractual goods or services are transferred over the contract term varies significantly each period, it may be appropriate to use an amortization model that more closely aligns with the transfer pattern’s variations. For example, amortization could be allocated to the periods on the basis of the proportion of the total goods or services that are transferred each period. If the cost is related to goods or services that are transferred at a point in time, the amortized cost would be recognized at the same point in time. [...] ASC 340-40 does not provide specific guidance on the method an entity should use to amortize contract costs recognized as assets. Rather, ASC 340-40-35-1 requires an entity to amortize such costs “on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.” Entities will therefore have to determine an appropriate method for amortizing costs capitalized in accordance with ASC 340-40-25-1 or ASC 340-40-25-5."

So while one insertion may be costly due to resizing, subsequent insertions are fast and efficient.\n\nLet’s break down how this works with an example involving a dynamic array: [...] Skip to content\n\nOreate AI Blog\n\nRead the latest guides, tips, and insights on smart Al writing and presentation generation!\n\nHomeContentUnderstanding Amortized Time Complexity: A Deep Dive\n\nContent\n\n# Understanding Amortized Time Complexity: A Deep Dive\n\noreateLeave a comment\n\nAmortized time complexity is a fascinating concept in algorithm analysis that helps us understand the average performance of an operation over a sequence of operations, rather than focusing solely on the worst-case scenario. Imagine you’re using a dynamic array that needs to resize itself when it runs out of space. The resizing operation might take linear time—O(n)—because all existing elements must be copied to the new array. However, this doesn’t mean every insertion will take O(n) time. [...] The key takeaway here is understanding how amortization provides insight into overall efficiency by smoothing out spikes in operational costs across multiple actions. It gives developers confidence in algorithms whose worst-case scenarios seem daunting at first glance but perform well under typical usage conditions.\n\nThis principle applies not just in data structures like arrays or heaps but also extends into other areas such as splay trees—a type of self-adjusting binary search tree where certain access patterns lead to improved performance over sequences despite potentially high single-operation costs.\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nLast Updated on 2026-01-15T08:40:38+00:00 by oreate"

      "snippet": "There are three main techniques used for amortized analysis:\n\n The aggregate method, where the total running time for a sequence of operations is analyzed.\n The accounting (or banker's) method, where we impose an extra charge on inexpensive operations and use it to pay for expensive operations later on.\n The potential (or physicist's) method, in which we derive a potential function characterizing the amount of extra work we can do in each step. This potential either increases or decreases with each successive operation, but cannot be negative. [...] If n < m, then the actual cost is 1, n increases by 1, and m does not change. Then the potential increases by 2, so the amortized time is 1 + 2 = 3.\n If n = m, then the array is doubled, so the actual time is n + 1. But the potential drops from n to 2, so amortized time is n + 1 + (2 − n) = 3.\n\nIn both cases, the amortized time is O(1).\n\nThe key to amortized analysis with the physicist's method is to define the right potential function. The potential function needs to save up enough time to be used later when it is needed. But it cannot save so much time that it causes the amortized time of the current operation to be too high. [...] We emphasize that the extra time charged to an operation does not mean that the operation really takes that much time. It is just a method of accounting that makes the analysis easier.\n\nIf we let c'i be the charge for the i-th operation and ci be the true cost, then we would like\n\nΣ1≤i≤n ci ≤ Σ1≤i≤n c'i\n\nfor all n, which says that the amortized time Σ1≤i≤n c'i for that sequence of n operations is a bound on the true time Σ1≤i≤n ci.\n\nBack to the example of the extensible array. Say it costs 1 unit to insert an element and 1 unit to move it when the table is doubled. Clearly a charge of 1 unit per insertion is not enough, because there is nothing left over to pay for the moving. A charge of 2 units per insertion again is not enough, but a charge of 3 appears to be:"

It’s similar in concept to depreciation, which\nis used for fixed tangible assets like machinery, but amortization is applied to intangible\nassets, such as copyrights, patents, and customer lists.\n\nThe term “loan amortization” is also used to describe how loan repayments are divided between\ninterest charges and the reduction of outstanding principal, although that’s a completely\ndifferent financial process. This article focuses on amortization as it relates to\naccounting and expense management in business. Under US Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (GAAP), this is guided primarily by ASC 350-30.\n\nKey Takeaways [...] Key Takeaways\n\n Amortization is the accounting process used to spread the cost of intangible assets over\n  the periods expected to benefit from their use.\n The customary method for amortization is the straight-line method.\n Determining which intangible assets may be amortized and the correct capitalized value\n  can sometimes be tricky.\n Amortization rules differ significantly for tax versus book purposes.\n Applied correctly, amortization can result in significant tax savings.\n\n## Amortization in Business Explained [...] ## How Is Amortization Calculated?\n\nFor book purposes, companies generally calculate amortization using the straight-line method.\nThis method spreads the cost of the intangible asset evenly over all the accounting periods\nthat will benefit from it.\n\nThe formula for amortization is:\n\nAnnual Amortization =\nCapitalized cost / Estimated useful life\n\nDetermining the capitalized\ncost of an intangible asset (the numerator in this equation) can be the\ntrickiest part of the calculation.

      "snippet": "Amortization expense is essential because it directly impacts how a company reports its profitability and maintains transparency for stakeholders. The expense is necessary because it ensures the total cost of a valuable intangible asset is recognized over the many years the asset generates revenue, rather than hitting the financial statements all at once. This avoids having the company's profits be artificially distorted by a large, upfront asset purchase, thus providing a smoother, more accurate measure of true operational profitability over time. Ultimately, reporting amortization gives investors, creditors, and other stakeholders a realistic, consistent view of how quickly valuable intangible assets (like patents or software) are being consumed, which is vital for making sound [...] ## What is Amortization Expense?\n\nAmortization expense is the systematic allocation of the cost of an intangible asset over its estimated useful life. It specifically applies to assets you cannot physically touch, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, acquired software, and certain types of goodwill. This accounting mechanism ensures that the expense is recognized over the period the asset generates revenue, following the matching principle. Note that this is different from loan amortization, which refers to the scheduled repayment of a debt over time.\n\n## How Amortization Expense Works in Accounting [...] ## How Amortization Expense Works in Accounting\n\nMost companies use the straight-line method to calculate amortization, which is the simplest and most common allocation approach. This method evenly distributes the total cost of the asset across its estimated useful life.​\n\nFor example, if a company purchases a patent for $100,000 with an estimated useful life of 10 years, the annual amortization expense will be $10,000 per year ($100,000/10 years).\n\nAmortization is a non-cash expense, meaning no actual cash changes hands when the entry is recorded. It is captured using an adjusting journal entry at the end of an accounting period:"
