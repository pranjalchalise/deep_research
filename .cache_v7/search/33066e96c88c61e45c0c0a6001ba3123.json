      "snippet": "ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, has named  68 Fellows for transformative contributions to computing science and technology. All the 2023 inductees are longstanding ACM Members who were selected by their peers for groundbreaking innovations that have improved how we live, work, and play. [...] Sir Tim's contributions to the Web go far beyond the creation of the original code. He created and shaped the World Wide Web Consortium, which has developed the standards that are so crucial to Web development and use. He was also a founder of the Web Science Trust, a British charitable trust devoted to the interdisciplinary study of the Web and its effect on society, and the World Wide Web Foundation, which works to establish the open web as a public good and a basic right. Sir Tim continues to extend his original invention and is a passionate advocate for adding semantic annotation to the web."

His work has had an enormous impact on many areas of physical chemistry, especially building up a quantitative bridge between the laws of mechanics and complex macroscopic phenomena.\n\nYuan Tseh Lee perfected the technique of observing chemical reactions.\n\nHe mastered the “crossed molecular beam technique,” along with with Dudley R. Herschbach and John C. Polanyi. The process involves using mass spectroscopy and bringing together beams of molecules at high speeds to identify the results of a chemical reaction."

[...] In the early 1960s, Lee and collaborators initiated the important field of high-energy neutrino physics. In 1964, Lee, with M. Nauenberg, analyzed the divergences connected with particles of zero rest mass, and described a general method known as the KLN theorem for dealing with these divergences, which still plays an important role in contemporary work in QCD, with its massless, self-interacting gluons. In 1974–75, Lee published several papers on \"A New Form of Matter in High Density\", which led to the modern field of RHIC physics, now dominating the entire high-energy nuclear physics field.[citation needed] [...] From 1997 to 2003, Lee was director of the RIKEN-BNL Research Center (now director emeritus), which together with other researchers from Columbia, completed a 1 teraflops supercomputer QCDSP for lattice QCD in 1998 and a 10 teraflops QCDOC machine in 2001.[citation needed] Leading up to 2005, Lee and Richard M. Friedberg developed a new method to solve the Schrödinger equation, leading to convergent iterative solutions for the long-standing quantum degenerate double-wall potential and other instanton problems. They also did work on the neutrino mapping matrix."

      "snippet": "From 1950 to 1953 Lee conducted research at the University of Chicago, the University of California, Berkeley and the Institute for Advanced Study, located in Princeton. During this period, he made significant contributions to particle physics, statistical mechanics, field theory, astrophysics, condensed-matter physics and turbulence theory, demonstrating a wide range of interests and deep insights in several frontiers of physics. In a 1952 paper on turbulence, for example, Lee pointed out the significant difference between fluid dynamics in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces, namely, there is no turbulence in two dimensions. This finding provided essential conditions for John von Neumann’s model, which used supercomputers to simulate weather.\n\n### Profound impact [...] In 2011 Lee retired as a professor emeritus from Columbia at the age of 85. In China, he enjoyed immense respect, not only for being the first Chinese scientist (with Chen-Ning Yang) to win a Nobel Prize, but also for enhancing the level of science and education in China and promoting the Sino-American collaboration in high-energy physics. This led to the establishment and successful construction of China’s first major high-energy physics facility, the Beijing Electron–Positron Collider (BEPC). At the beginning of this century, Lee supported and personally helped the upgrade of BEPC, the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment and others. In addition, he initiated, promoted and executed the China–US Physics Examination and Application plan, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, [...] In the 1970s, Lee published papers exploring the origins of CP violation, suggesting that it might stem from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the vacuum and predicting several significant phenomenological consequences. In 1974, Lee and G C Wick investigated whether spontaneously broken symmetries in the vacuum could be partially restored under certain conditions. They found that heavy-ion collisions could achieve this restoration and produce observable effects. This work pioneered the study of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) vacuum, phase transitions and quark–gluon plasma. It also laid the theoretical and experimental foundation for relativistic heavy-ion collision physics."

      "title": "Francis Fan Lee, former professor and interdisciplinary speech ...",
      "snippet": "Work on the “RLE reading machine,” as it was called, was inherently interdisciplinary, and Lee drew upon the influences of multiple contemporaries, including linguists Morris Halle and Noam Chomsky, and engineer Kenneth Stevens, whose quantal theory of speech production and recognition broke down human speech into discrete, and limited, combinations of sound. One of Lee’s greatest contributions to the machine, which he co-built with Donald Troxel, was a clever and efficient storage system that used root words, prefixes, and suffixes to make the real-time synthesis of half-a-million English words possible, while only requiring about 32,000 words’ worth of storage. The solution was emblematic of Lee’s creative approach to solving complex research problems, an approach which earned him [...] Lee’s research work continued to straddle both novel inquiry and practical, commercial application — in 1969, together with Charles Bagnaschi, he founded American Data Sciences, later changing the company’s name to Lexicon Inc. The company specialized in producing devices that expanded on Lee’s work in digital signal compression and expansion: for example, the first commercially available speech compressor and pitch shifter, which was marketed as an educational tool for blind students and those with speech processing disorders. The device, called Varispeech, allowed students to speed up written material without losing pitch — much as modern audiobook listeners speed up their chapters to absorb books at their preferred rate. Later innovations of Lee’s included the Time Compressor Model [...] innovations of Lee’s included the Time Compressor Model 1200, which added a film and video component to the speeding-up process, allowing television producers to subtly speed up a movie, sitcom, or advertisement to precisely fill a limited time slot without having to resort to making cuts. For this work, he received an Emmy Award for technical contributions to editing."

      "snippet": "As a Chinese-American scientist who achieved great success in the United States, Lee also served as an important bridge between the scientific communities of China and the West. Lee directed considerable efforts to nurturing Chinese scientists through the establishment of programs such as CUSPEA.3 In an interview with Adam Smith, Editor-in-Chief of NobelPrize.org, conducted in 2007, Lee described how, in the late 1970s and into the 1980s, “there was no way for a Chinese college graduate to go to [the] United States or Canada or any place to study” because the cost was prohibitive. His program, organized primarily to support students working in physics, was extended through his friends and colleagues to also assist biology students, as well as those in other fields. Lee’s efforts have been [...] Although best known for his contributions to the field of particle physics, Lee’s early work focused on stellar astrophysics. In 1950, he completed his doctoral studies with a thesis on the hydrogen composition of white dwarf stars. His research demonstrated that these stellar remnants contain minimal hydrogen, specifically less than 1% of their mass. This provided strong evidence that white dwarfs represent the final evolutionary stage for most stars. [...] as well as those in other fields. Lee’s efforts have been described as having placed Chinese physics on a “more and more robust footing.”"
