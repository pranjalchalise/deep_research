He won\nhis second consulship in 104 B.C., and shortly afterward achieved great renown\nfor defeating the Teutone and Cimbri invaders in northern Italy.\nThese victories brought him great\npopularity with both the people of Rome, and the army, and he was elected consul five years in\nsuccession, from 104 to 100 B.C., an unprecedented run. During this period he\nreorganized the army, an achievement that laid the ground work for the Roman legions of imperial\ndays.

      "snippet": "## Key Figures\n\n Gaius Marius (157-86 b.c.e.), commoner who gained high civilian status through military achievements\n\n## Summary of Event\n\nMarius’s reforms of the Roman army were the culmination of developments arising out of Rome’s emergence as an imperial power. These reforms marked the beginning of developments that led to the civil wars of the late first century and the end of the Roman Republic. [...] Research Starters Home\n\nEBSCO Knowledge Advantage TM\n\n# Gaius Marius Creates a Private Army\n\nGaius Marius, a significant figure in Roman military history, transformed the Roman army from a citizen militia into a professional force during the late second century BCE. This transformation was necessitated by the demands of Rome's expanding empire, which required larger, longer-serving armies. Traditional recruitment methods, reliant on property ownership, became increasingly strained as small landholders struggled to balance farming and military service, particularly with the influx of cheap grain from conquered territories that undermined their livelihoods. [...] The reforms of Tiberius and Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, designed to reestablish the small farmer class, failed to achieve their purpose while creating a climate of mutual suspicion and hostility between the ruling senatorial order and the rest of the Roman population. When Gaius Marius, an experienced soldier unconnected with the senatorial order, offered to remove the conduct of the Jugurthine War (111-105 b.c.e.) from the hands of the senate-appointed generals, he was elected to office by a large popular majority. Furthermore, over the objections of the senate, Marius was entrusted with the African campaign. Seeing the difficulties of raising an army in the traditional way, and less bound by tradition than generals of higher birth, Marius refused to order a conscription. Instead, he"

      "snippet": "Plutarch relates several opinions on the end of Marius: one, from Posidonius, holds that Marius contracted pleurisy; Gaius Piso has it that Marius walked with his friends and discussed all of his accomplishments with them, adding that no intelligent man ought leave himself to fortune. Plutarch then anonymously relates that Marius, having gone into a fit of passion in which he announced in a delusionary manner that he was in command of the Mithridatic War, began to act as he would have on the field of battle; finally, Plutarch relates that, ever an ambitious man, Marius lamented on his deathbed that he had not achieved all of which he was capable, despite his having acquired great wealth and having been chosen consul more times than any man before him. [...] The Cimbri, after their decisive victory at Arausio, marched west into Hispania. Marius was tasked with rebuilding, effectively from scratch, the Gallic legions. Building his army around a core of trained legionaries from the last year, Marius again secured exemption from the property requirements and with his newly minted reputation for victory, raised an army of some thirty thousand Romans and forty thousand Italian allies and auxiliaries. He established a base around the town of Aquae Sextiae (modern Aix-en-Provence) and trained his men. [...] Gaius Marius (Latin: (/wiki/Help:IPA/Latin \"Help:IPA/Latin\"); c. 157 BC – 13 January 86 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times. Rising from a family of smallholders in a village called Ceraetae in the district of Arpinum, Marius acquired his initial military experience serving with Scipio Aemilianus at the Siege of Numantia in 134 BC. He won election as tribune of the plebs in 119 BC and passed a law limiting aristocratic interference in elections. Barely elected praetor in 115 BC, he next became the governor of Further Spain where he campaigned against bandits."

      "snippet": "​Marius was not only a great general, but also a great military\nreformer. From his time a citizen militia was replaced by a\nprofessional soldiery, which had hitherto been little liked by the\nRoman people. He further made the cohort the military unit\ninstead of the maniple, and his cavalry and light-armed troops\nwere drawn from foreign countries, so that it may be said that\nMarius was the originator of the mercenary army. The Roman\nsoldier was henceforth a man who had no trade but war. A great\ngeneral could hardly fail to become the foremost man in the\nstate. Marius, however, unlike Caesar, did not attempt to\noverturn the oligarchy by means of the army; he used rather\nsuch expedients as the constitution seemed to allow, though\nthey had to be backed up by riot and violence. He failed as [...] By this time Marius was generally recognized as the ablest\ngeneral of the day, and was appointed to the chief command\nagainst the Cimbri and Teutones. Two Roman armies had\nbeen destroyed near the Lake of Geneva, and it seemed as if a\nrepetition of the disaster of the Allia and the capture of Rome\nitself might not be impossible. Marius, out of unpromising\nmaterials and a demoralized soldiery, organized a well-disciplined\narmy, with which he inflicted on the invaders two decisive\ndefeats, the first in 102 at Aquae Sextiae (Aix), 18 m. north of\nMarseilles, and the second in the following year on the Raudian\nplain near Vercellae (Vercelli), about midway between Turin\nand Milan. For some centuries afterwards Rome remained\nunmolested by northern barbarians. In 101 Marius was elected [...] ​MARIUS, GAIUS (155–86 B.C.), Roman general, of plebeian\ndescent, the son of a small farmer of Cereatae (mod. Casamare,\n“home of Marius”) near Arpinum. He served first in Spain\nunder the great Scipio Africanus, and rose from the ranks to\nbe an officer. In 119 as tribune he proposed a law intended\nto limit the influence of the nobles at elections. This brought\nhim into conflict with the aristocratic party, who prevented\nhim from obtaining the aedileship. When about forty years\nof age he married a lady of patrician rank, Julia, the aunt of\nJulius Caesar. This gave him a new social status, and being\nat the same time a popular favourite and a brave, energetic\nsoldier, he was in 115 elected praetor, in which capacity he\neffected the subjugation of the troublesome province of Further"

      "snippet": "Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship [...] Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the distinguished and inordinately conceited Caecilii Metelli, then at the height of their political power. They backed his candidacy for tribune (defender) of the plebs (common people) in 119. As tribune, Marius proposed a bill affecting procedure in elections and legislative assemblies by narrowing the bridges—the gangway across which each voter passed to fill in and deposit his ballot tablet—as a result of which there was no longer room on the gangway for observers, normally aristocrats, who abused their position to influence an individual’s vote. When the two consuls tried to persuade the Senate to block the bill, Marius threatened them with imprisonment, and the bill was carried."
