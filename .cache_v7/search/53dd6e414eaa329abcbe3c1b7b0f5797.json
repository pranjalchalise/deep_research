Altman received the Axel Springer Award 2025 for his role in bringing artificial intelligence from research labs into everyday life—while consistently emphasizing the societal responsibility tied to this technology. Highlights of the event are available in the video here: [...] The centerpiece of the evening was a conversation between Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner and Sam Altman, focusing on freedom of expression, transatlantic relations, and the risks of artificial intelligence. They also discussed the cooperation between SAP and OpenAI announced earlier the same day. Addressing Altman, Döpfner said: “One of the main purposes of this award is to encourage entrepreneurship. To encourage a risk-taker culture. You are famous for taking the biggest risks.” [...] Mercedes-Benz Group CEO Ola Källenius sent his congratulations in a video message: “Sam, the work you have done is nothing short of spectacular. It is a good thing that you are in the driver’s seat at OpenAI. The job of a pioneer is never done. There is always a next frontier.” As a surprise for motorsport enthusiast Altman, 2016 Formula 1 World Champion Nico Rosberg appeared in person, joking: “I heard you own my dream car, the McLaren F1.

[...] Despite Musk's early involvement in founding OpenAI, he has expressed growing concerns about the organization in recent years. As Tesla's focus on AI increased, Musk resigned from OpenAI to eliminate potential future conflicts, though he has continued to donate to the nonprofit.
