      "snippet": "Michael Jordan (born February 17, 1963, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) is an American former collegiate and professional basketball player widely considered to be one of the greatest all-around players in the history of the game. Jordan’s unmatched athleticism and competitive drive revolutionized the sport. He won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls (1991–93, 1996–98), and he was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998).\n\n(Read James Naismith’s 1929 Britannica essay on his invention of basketball.)\n\n## Education and Olympics [...] ## NBA career\n\n## Chicago Bulls\n\nIn 1984 Jordan, a guard standing 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 meters), was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. He quickly became known as an exceptionally talented shooter and passer and a tenacious defender. In his first season (1984–85), he led the league in scoring and was named Rookie of the Year. After missing most of the following season with a broken foot, he returned to lead the NBA in scoring for seven consecutive seasons, averaging about 33 points per game. He was only the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain) to score 3,000 points in a single season (1986–87). Jordan was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988. [...] In October 1993, after leading the Bulls to their third consecutive championship, Jordan retired briefly and pursued a career in professional baseball. He returned to basketball in March 1995. In the 1995–96 season Jordan led the Bulls to a 72–10 regular season record, the best in the history of the NBA (broken in 2015–16 by the Golden State Warriors). From 1996 to 1998 the Jordan-led Bulls again won three championships in a row, and each time Jordan was named MVP of the NBA Finals. After the 1997–98 season Jordan retired again.\n\nCareer Stats\n\n Points per game: 30.1\n Total points: 32,292\n Steals per game: 2.3\n Total steals: 2,514\n Total games: 1,072"

      "snippet": "Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players. Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan as their role model while they were growing up. Commentators have also dubbed a number of players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade. Jordan's jersey number, 23, also became iconic; numerous subsequent NBA players have worn it to pay tribute to him, including James, Metta Sandiford-Artest, and Anthony Davis. [...] Despite his 18-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995. Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic. At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson \"Nick Anderson (basketball)\") stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\", and said, \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to\".
