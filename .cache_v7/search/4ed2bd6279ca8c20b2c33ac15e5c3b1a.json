Wouldn't have been an issue until Mr Mountbatten Windsor cosied up to paedophile Epstein and now a committee of MPs wants to scrutinise all royals paying peppercorns for Palaces. Also in this episode, they think its OBR, it is now - how long can Rachel survive.? The anti semitic rhetoric of Corbyn and Sultanas new left wing Your Party, unless You're Jewish, we presume.

Trump’s War - Everywhere\n\nThe President’s hardline on immigration and crime has blown up into civil unrest in Minneapolis after an ICE agent shot dead a woman driver he claimed was trying to run him over. It’s been a news packed week for Trump, much played out on the international stage so we ask has Donald gone too far or is this just the New World order?. Greenland, which is rarely green and mainly ice white, is the latest tick on the US shopping list and what a dilemma this poses for Sir Keir and his dance card with the White House.

This is our bumper Christmas report card on the heroes and villains, the legends and losers, the prize recipients of another astonishing year at Westminster, Royal Lodge and Mar-a-Lago, all with no punches pulled.

Rather than doing, like, my 20th rewatch of the series I wondered if you could recommend (in your opinions) your favourite Pierce-centric episodes for me to re-watch?\n\nFor me the D&D episode is a clear stand-out. Ironically, so is the episode where they read out his will (even though he's not even in that episode!).\n\nWhich episodes would you suggest?\n\nThank you all.\n\n# Related Answers Section\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community"
