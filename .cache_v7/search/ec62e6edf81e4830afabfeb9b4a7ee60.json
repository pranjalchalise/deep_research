Furthermore, ridesharing apps like Uber and Lyft use machine learning to match riders to the drivers (Source: Medium).\n Healthcare: Machine learning can augment and accelerate human capabilities. It is already helping doctors with pattern recognition; models are trained to classify tumors that are hard to see with the human eye. [...] Customer Service: Chatbots that act as virtual agents can easily handle text-based queries. Several businesses have implemented chatbots on their websites, allowing them to resolve queries faster.\n Financial Transactions: In the U.S., 60 percent of credit card holders are victims of fraud (Source: Security.org). To mitigate this issue, machine learning and deep learning are widely used in fraud detection where financial institutions train machine learning models and classification algorithms to identify suspicious online transactions and flag them for further investigation.\n Cybersecurity: Reinforcement learning uses machine learning to train models to analyze and respond to cyberattacks and detect intrusions. [...] Representation: Just as humans can interpret knowledge in various ways, machines can do the same. Representation refers to how certain knowledge is described for the machine to learn and understand. This makes it easier for machine learning to learn, reason, and make effective decisions based on a specific goal.\n Data Storage: It helps users store and retrieve large amounts of data. Both humans and computers can utilize data storage. They can store, retrieve, and use data for advanced learning.\n Abstraction: Abstraction helps us extract knowledge about the stored data and create foundational concepts around it. This involves applying the knowledge to both known and new models."

[...] ### 1. Recommendation systems\n\nRecommendation engines are one of the most popular uses of machine learning, as product recommendations are featured on most e-commerce websites. Using machine learning models, websites track your behavior to recognize patterns in your browsing history, previous purchases, and shopping cart activity. This data collection is used for pattern recognition to predict user preferences.\n\nCompanies like Spotify and Netflix use similar machine learning algorithms to recommend music or TV shows based on your previous listening and viewing history. Over time and with training, these algorithms aim to understand your preferences to accurately predict which artists or films you may enjoy.\n\n### 2. Social media connections [...] ### 7. Credit card fraud detection\n\nPredictive analytics can help determine whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. Fraud examiners use AI and machine learning to monitor variables involved in past fraud events. They use these training examples to measure the likelihood that a specific event was fraudulent activity.\n\n### 8. Traffic predictions\n\nWhen you use Google Maps to map your commute to work or a new restaurant in town, it provides an estimated arrival time. Google uses machine learning to build models of how long trips will take based on historical traffic data (gleaned from satellites). It then takes that data based on your current trip and traffic levels to predict the best route according to these factors.\n\n### 9. Self-driving car technology"

      "snippet": "Outside of email spam detection, some commonly known machine learning applications include customer segmentation based on demographic data (sales and marketing), stock price prediction (finance), claims approval automation (insurance), content recommendations based on viewing history (media & entertainment), and much more. Machine learning has become ubiquitous and finds varied applications in our day-to-day lives.\n\nAt the end of this article, we will share many resources to get you started with machine learning.\n\n## The Different Types of Machine Learning [...] There are broadly two types of supervised learning use cases:\n\n Regression: Regression use cases are when we try to predict a continuous outcome that falls within a range. A good example would be house price prediction based on the square footage of the house, where it’s located, the number of bedrooms, and other relevant dimensions.\n Classification: Classification use cases are when we try to classify whether an outcome falls within two or more categories. Spam detectors are classification models (either spam or not spam) — but other classification use cases include customer churn prediction (will churn or not churn), identifying cars in pictures (multiple categories), and more. [...] ### Supervised Machine Learning\n\nMost machine learning use cases revolve around algorithms learning patterns from historical data and applying them to new data in the form of predictions. This is often referred to as supervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms are shown both historical inputs and outputs on a particular problem we’re trying to solve, where inputs are essentially features or dimensions of the observation we’re trying to predict, and where outputs are the outcomes we want to predict. Let’s illustrate this with our spam detection example."

      "snippet": "## 1. Facial recognition\n\nFacial recognition is one of the more obvious applications of machine learning. People previously received name suggestions for their mobile photos and Facebook tagging, but now someone is immediately tagged and verified by comparing and analyzing patterns through facial contours. And facial recognition paired with deep learning has become highly useful in healthcare to help detect genetic diseases or track a patient’s use of medication more accurately. It’s also used to combat important social issues such as child sex trafficking or sexual exploitation of children. The list of applications and industries influenced by it is steadily on the rise.\n\n## 2. Product recommendations [...] family practitioners or internists when treating patients bedside because data trends will predict health risks like heart disease. As an example, wearables generate mass amounts of data on the wearer’s health and many use AI and machine learning to alert them or their doctors of issues to support preventative measures and respond to emergencies. [...] Every day, we’re getting closer to a full transition to electronic medical records. That means healthcare information for clinicians can be enhanced with analytics and machine learning to gain insights that support better planning and patient care, improved diagnoses, and lower treatment costs. Healthcare brands such as Pfizer and Providence have begun to benefit from analytics enhanced by human and artificial intelligence. There are some processes that are better suited to leverage machine learning; machine learning integration with radiology, cardiology, and pathology, for example, is leading to earlier detection of abnormalities or heightened attention on concerning areas. In the long run, machine learning will also benefit family practitioners or internists when treating patients"
