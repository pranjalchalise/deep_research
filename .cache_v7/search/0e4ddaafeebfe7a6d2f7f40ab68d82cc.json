      "snippet": "Gather\n\n## The future of artificial intelligence\n\nTuring's predictions about thinking machines in the 1950s laid the philosophical groundwork for later developments in artificial intelligence (AI). Neural network pioneers such as Hinton and LeCun in the 80s and 2000s paved the way for generative models. In turn, the deep learning boom of the 2010s fueled major advances in natural language processing (NLP), image and text generation and medical diagnostics through image segmentation, expanding AI capabilities. These advancements are culminating in multimodal AI, which can seemingly do it all—but just as previous advancements have led to multimodal, what might multimodal AI lead to? [...] AI supercharges predictive and big data analytics by processing and interpreting vast amounts of data to forecast trends and inform decisions. In robotics, the development of more autonomous and adaptable machines simplifies tasks such as assembly, exploration and service delivery. Also, AI-driven innovations on the Internet of Things (IoT) enhance the connectivity and intelligence of devices, leading to smarter homes, cities and industrial systems.\n\n### Become an AI expert\n\nGain the knowledge to prioritize AI investments that drive business growth. Get started with our free AI Academy today and lead the future of AI in your organization.\n\n## AI in 2034\n\nHere are some of the advancements in AI that we should see in ten years:\n\n### Multimodal status quo [...] Another significant moonshot is the development of a distributed Internet of AI4, or federated AI, which envisions a distributed and decentralized AI infrastructure. Unlike traditional centralized AI models that rely on vast data centers, federated AI operates across multiple devices and locations, processing data locally to enhance privacy and reduce latency.\n\nBy enabling smartphones, IoT gadgets and edge computing nodes to collaborate and share insights without transmitting raw data, federated AI fosters a more secure and scalable AI ecosystem. Current research focuses on developing efficient algorithms and protocols for seamless collaboration among distributed models, facilitating real-time learning while maintaining high data integrity and privacy standards."

If recent years were about AI answering questions and reasoning through problems, the next wave will be about true collaboration, Chennapragada says.\n\n“The future isn’t about replacing humans,” she says. “It’s about amplifying them.” [...] What’s different now is the rise of hybrid computing, where quantum works alongside AI and supercomputers. AI finds patterns in data. Supercomputers run massive simulations. And quantum adds a new layer that will drive far greater accuracy for modeling molecules and materials, he says. This progress coincides with advances in logical qubits, which are physical quantum bits grouped together so they can detect and correct errors and compute — a critical step toward reliability. [...] King points to achievements demonstrated in 2025 by Microsoft AI’s Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), which solved complex medical cases with 85.5% accuracy, far above the 20% average for experienced physicians. With Copilot and Bing already answering more than 50 million health questions daily, he sees advances in AI as a way to give people more influence and control over their own health and wellbeing.\n\n## AI will become central to the research process"

The advance, funded in part by the Gates Foundation, could fast-track the development of urgently needed TB therapies.\n\n#### AI Peers Into the Heart\n\nBy recording signals from outside of heart muscle cells and using AI to reconstruct what’s happening inside these cells, engineers were able to monitor heart activity with remarkable accuracy — without invasive methods or physically penetrating the cells. The breakthrough offers safer, faster insights into how heart cells function, communicate and respond to new drugs.\n\n#### AI Sharpens Breast Cancer Treatment Plans [...] #### AI in Motion\n\nUC San Diego engineers have created a flexible patch — a wireless, skin-mounted ultrasound device — that monitors muscle activity in real time to control a robotic arm, among other uses.  To extract additional insights from these muscle signals, the researchers developed an AI algorithm that maps the signals to their corresponding muscle distributions. Compact, battery-powered and designed for long-term wear, the technology could open new possibilities in health care monitoring and human-machine interaction.\n\n#### Using AI to Enable Better Vision [...] With a growing network of more than 1,200 natural-hazard monitoring cameras spanning remote mountaintops to wildland-urban interfaces, ALERTCalifornia collects real-time data and utilizes AI that helps emergency managers spot smoke, monitor fires and plan evacuations. UC San Diego’s WIFIRE team at the San Diego Supercomputer Center utilizes those camera and sensor feeds to pinpoint wildfire ignition locations and create predictive models that map how a fire will spread. That valuable information is shared with emergency managers and first responders within minutes via the statewide program known as FIRIS, or the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System. These models are further refined by AI-powered aerial sensing — including infrared imaging — to track fire perimeters through thick"
