Nevertheless, Lee's films remained popular, gained a large cult following, and became widely imitated and exploited. He became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of Cantonese culture in his films,[page needed] and among Asian Americans for defying Asian stereotypes in the United States. Even after his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern combat sports, including judo, karate, mixed martial arts, and boxing, as well as modern popular culture, including film, television, comics, animation, and video games. Time \"Time (magazine)\") magazine named him one of the 100 most [...] After a year of his training with Ip Man, most of the other students refused to train with Lee. They had learned of his mixed ancestry, and the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians. Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, \"Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Ip Man\". However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Ip Man, William Cheung, and Wong Shun-leung.\n\nIn 1958, Lee won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion, Gary Elms, in the final. That year, Lee who was also a good cha-cha \"Cha-cha-cha (dance)\") dancer, won Hong Kong's Crown Colony Cha-Cha Championship.

He became an iconic figure known throughout the world when he starred in a series of martial arts films that showcased his incredible physical talents. [...] Lee was born in San Francisco; his parents were in the city because his father was on tour with the Chinese Opera. Raised in Hong Kong, he began appearing in Chinese films as a child and by the time he was 18 had appeared in 20 films. At 13, he began studying martial arts with Wing Chun Master Yip Man.\n\nLee moved back to the U.S. in 1959, where he attended college. He supported himself by teaching martial arts at schools he established in Seattle, Oakland and Los Angeles, while he and his wife, Linda, raised their son, Brandon, and daughter, Shannon. Lee quickly began to develop new ideas about martial arts and training based on his experiences, leading him to create his own art called Jeet Kune Do, or “The Way of the Intercepting Fist.” [...] Lee rekindled his acting career in Hollywood with a series of small parts in film and on television, most notably as Kato in the series “The Green Hornet.” In 1971, he starred in the first of five legendary martial arts films that were huge financial successes and made him an international star. Lee’s life was cut short when he died at age 32 of a cerebral edema caused by an allergic reaction to pain medication, just days before the release of his blockbuster hit “Enter the Dragon” (1973).\n\n## Awards/Recognition\n\nView more inductees from the 9th class, inducted in 2015.\n\n##### The California Museum thanks its sponsors for supporting its mission through the California Hall of Fame.\n\nCalifornia Museum Bear\nCalifornia Museum Bear\nCalifornia Museum\nCalifornia Museum"

      "snippet": "Bruce Lee (born November 27, 1940, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died July 20, 1973, Hong Kong) was an American-born film actor who was renowned for his martial arts prowess and who helped popularize martial arts movies in the 1970s.\n\nLee was born in San Francisco, but he grew up in Hong Kong. He was introduced to the entertainment industry at an early age, as his father was an opera singer and part-time actor. The younger Lee began appearing in films as a child and was frequently cast as a juvenile delinquent or street urchin. As a teenager, he took up with local gangs and began learning kung fu to better defend himself. At that time he also started dance lessons, which further refined his footwork and balance; in 1958 Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship. [...] American Sports Nicknames\n\nLee had difficulty finding acting jobs after the cancellation of The Green Hornet, and he began supplementing his income by giving private jeet kune do lessons to Hollywood stars, including Steve McQueen. In the 1969 film Marlowe, Lee received notice for a scene in which he destroyed an entire office through kickboxing and karate moves. Troubled by his inability to find other suitable roles, however, he moved back to Hong Kong in 1971. There Lee starred in two films that broke box-office records throughout Asia, and he later found success in the United States with Tang shan da xiong (1971; Fists of Fury [U.S.], or The Big Boss [Hong Kong English title]) and Jing wu men (1972; The Chinese Connection [U.S.], or Fist of Fury [Hong Kong English title]). [...] Lee’s parents were increasingly disturbed by his street fighting and run-ins with the police, and they sent him to live in the United States shortly after he turned 18. He lived with family friends in Seattle, where he finished high school and studied philosophy and drama at the University of Washington. While in Seattle he opened his first martial arts school, and in 1964 he relocated to Oakland, California, to found a second school. It was about that time that he developed his own technique—jeet kune do, a blend of ancient kung fu, fencing, boxing, and philosophy—which he began teaching instead of traditional martial arts. He drew the attention of a television producer after giving a kung fu demonstration at a Los Angeles-area karate tournament, and he was cast as the sidekick Kato in"

This was a significant feather in Bruce's cap as a Wing Chun student, because he could only use his punches. These early experiences in both fencing and boxing fueled Bruce's curiosity and helped shaped his abilities to evaluate and adapt the most effective methods from other arts, to his own. Bruce is not in this photo, taken at that same tournament, but one can only imagine.\n\nBruce with JFGFI Seattle students.
