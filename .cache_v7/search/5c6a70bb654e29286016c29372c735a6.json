Also, table 5 doesn't show the numbers for \"knowledge of SI\" and \"correct practice\" which are mentioned in the text. [...] On the discussion, given that the account of qualitative interviews emphasizes nurse overload, I would suggest for this study to recommend that future studies include some quantitative account of the level of overload that goes beyond the simple number of injections, as nurses can be overloaded by other issues. I would mention, for one, the literature on burnout syndrome. [...] A number of recommendations can be made based on the results of the study: (1) Enhancing the sterilization performance, reducing the risk of infection due to injury; (2) Promoting training courses to improve knowledge and skills, educational communication to increase knowledge and awareness of risk of injections; (3) Establishing a regular injection safety monitoring and assessment program - the results and related information must be reported to management and disseminated to hospital staff; (4) Enhancing the inspection and supervision of regimes of reward and sanction, of emulation and commendation, and conducting research of SI assessment; (5) Focusing on the principles of sterilization, hand hygiene before injection, sterilization routine when taking drugs, and sterilization of"

      "snippet": "Still, our researchers caution that it’s early days for AI adoption, and that the impact on jobs will largely depend on how employers ultimately put the technology to best use.\n\n“Until the AI adoption cycle has fully played out, the potential labor market disruption—including which jobs are likely to be displaced by generative AI—will remain an open question,” Briggs and Dong write. [...] Temporary unemployment caused by the adoption of labor-saving technologies typically increases the US jobless rate by 0.3 percentage point with every 1 percentage point gain in technology-driven productivity growth. However the impact is usually fleeting—such job displacement tends to disappear after two years, Briggs and Dong write.\n\nHow will AI impact labor productivity?\n\nOur economists estimate that generative AI will raise the level of labor productivity in the US and other developed markets by around 15% when fully adopted and incorporated into regular production. That would translate into a half-percentage-point rise in the unemployment rate above its trend during the AI transition period, though that impact could be higher if AI adoption is more frontloaded than they assume. [...] Innovation related to artificial intelligence (AI) could displace 6-7% of the US workforce if AI is widely adopted. But the impact is likely to be transitory as new job opportunities created by the technology ultimately put people to work in other capacities, according to Goldman Sachs Research.\n\n“A recent pickup in AI adoption and reports of AI-related layoffs have raised concerns that AI will lead to widespread labor displacement,” Joseph Briggs, who co-leads the Global Economics team in Goldman Sachs Research, and economist Sarah Dong, write in a report. “While these trends could broaden as adoption increases, we remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade.”"

      "snippet": "data (e.g., the world food trade) may facilitate us to indirectly analyze the embodied biodiversity loss. Future research may use environmentally extended input–output database and network analysis methods to measure these indirect effects. Second, due to limited technologies, the lack of some data makes it impossible to address some other potentially important questions. For instance, due to a lack of available future long-term and high-resolution global land cover change and land-systems simulation data, we could not accurately estimate the dynamic changes in habitat and biodiversity losses due to urban land conversion. Future research can address this issue by simulating future global land cover and land-systems change maps under the SSP framework. Meanwhile, because habitat [...] land demand and the specific locations of future urban land expansion. These uncertainties may affect the accuracy of our estimated impacts of future urban land expansion on biodiversity at the country and ecoregional levels. Nevertheless, we believe that future research can provide more accurate answers to these questions with the help of a more refined SSP database. Fourth, because urban expansion has occurred within protected areas in the past few decades19.\"), we assumed that this trend of urban expansion within protected areas will continue without restrictions in the future. If we assume no urban development in protected areas, then by 2100, urban expansion within protected areas is expected to decrease by 16,111–59,306 km2 across SSP scenarios, which accounts for 4.59–8.02% of [...] in most coastal urban areas48 (Cambridge University Press, 2021).\")—can also affect urban development, urban environment, and urban expansion process49.\"),50.\"). In addition, climate change affects all aspects of life on Earth, perhaps with the most pervasive impact on species redistribution51.\"), such as poleward and elevational range shifts51.\"),52.\"). Climate-driven changes in species redistribution, which may be more profound in the future when climate change intensifies, will affect global biodiversity patterns and shape new hotspots. Thus, future research on the effect of urban expansion on biodiversity needs to take into account the effect of climate change in this process."
