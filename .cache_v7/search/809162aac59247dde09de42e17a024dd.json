      "snippet": "Ancient sources suggest that Marius was pre-destined, through the visions of a seer, to be Consul of Rome seven times. Not only would this prove true, but he would eventually be hailed as the third founder of Rome, and its savior.\n\nMilitary glory and personal ambition drove Marius straight to the top of the Roman system, but perhaps even more importantly, the man and his legacy would have a profound impact on the life of his nephew, Gaius Julius Caesar.\n\nAs a youth, Marius may have used his modest family influence to join the Republican legions as a junior officer, or may have risen from the ranks. It is difficult to determine exactly, but it is known that he spent his early career in Hispania under Scipio Aemilianus, grandson of Scipio Africanus. [...] Marius was both a great general and a sometimes adequate, if not good, politician. He was credited with saving Rome by defeating the Germanics, and created an atmosphere of enfranchisement with the Italians that was a necessity for Roman growth.\n\nThe reform of the legions was of the greatest benefit to the army and Roman power, but perhaps above all else, he was a deep influence on the life of his nephew, Gaius Julius Caesar. [...] Perhaps even more significant than the victory was the political and personal impact. While Marius, without an enemy to fight, would soon prove his inability as a peacetime politician, the personal rivalry between Marius and Sulla grew ever more fractured.\n\n  \n\n## Political Turmoil\n\nMarius returned from his Germanic campaign in triumph once again. First hailed as the third founder of Rome (Romulus was first of course, followed by Marcus Furius Camillus of the 'conquest of Veii' fame), and savior of the city, his success would be short lived."

He won\nhis second consulship in 104 B.C., and shortly afterward achieved great renown\nfor defeating the Teutone and Cimbri invaders in northern Italy.\nThese victories brought him great\npopularity with both the people of Rome, and the army, and he was elected consul five years in\nsuccession, from 104 to 100 B.C., an unprecedented run. During this period he\nreorganized the army, an achievement that laid the ground work for the Roman legions of imperial\ndays. Under Marius, Rome established for the first time a standing army, manned by professional\nsoldiers.

      "snippet": "## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarius was an extremely successful Roman general and politician. In ancient sources, he has been repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism. Plutarch says of him:\n\n> if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age. [...] After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate [...] It would seem that even at this early stage of his military career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He was elected on the basis of his accomplishments, even though he was not known by sight to the electors, as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes. After election, he likely served Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus on the Balearic Islands, helping him win a triumph. Next, Marius possibly ran for the quaestorship after losing an election for local office in Arpinum. He may have stood for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to a local competitor. It is possible, however, that Marius never ran for the quaestorship at all, jumping directly to plebeian tribune. He likely participated in the major Roman victory at the Battle of the"

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer.

Marius led a final, decisive engagement against the Germans at the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC. It was yet another victory, and the Germans were again routed. Having defeated the Germans, Marius was hailed as Rome’s savior. Upon returning to Rome, he was again elected as consul for the sixth time. [...] Marius further distinguished himself by serving as a junior military officer in the Jugurthine War in 109 BC. Exploiting his military prestige, the unorthodox Marius broke from tradition by running for the consulship in 107 BC. To bolster his electoral prospects, Marius presented himself as a true man of the people. He styled himself as a populist, whose personal competence and merit outshone the arbitrary privileges of Rome’s archaic aristocracy. “They may look down on my humble origins,” the gruff general remarked of Rome’s aristocrats, “but I have nothing but disdain for their idleness.”\n\nShare [...] Today’s article looks at both the beginning and end of things: Marius’ (comparatively) humble origins, his unconventional strategies, soaring political career, and ultimately his devastating conflicts with Sulla.\n\nSo, I suppose the question now is… whose side would you have been on?\n\nAll the best,\n\nSean Kelly\n\nManaging Editor\n\nClassical Wisdom\n\nBecome A Member!

      "snippet": "## Monarchs and Rulers\n\n# Who was Gaius Marius and What Did He Do?\n\nIt's said that General Marius reformed the Roman army from a rag-tag militia into one of the most effective and feared fighting forces in the world. From humble beginnings, he was elected consul a record seven times and he was hailed as ‘the third founder of Rome.’ Here is the story of Gaius Marius.\n\nGaius Marius was an accomplished military commander whose innovations in recruitment, training and organisation of the army allowed Rome to become one of the most powerful empires the world had ever seen. Indeed some historians believe that his transformations laid the foundation stone for Rome’s armed forces for centuries. [...] It was in this context that Gaius Marius emerged as a pivotal figure. As consul, Marius undertook a series of sweeping reforms that transformed the Roman military, creating a professional, disciplined, and well-equipped army.\n\n### Consul Marius: The Reformer\n\nPortrait of Gaius Marius, Roman general and statesman (Photo: mikroman6 via Getty Images)\n\nPrior to the intervention of Caius Marius, the armies of Rome were predominantly made up of wealthy landowners, who paid for their own armour and weapons – and therefore had the most to lose in the event of Roman defeats. However there simply weren’t enough of them, and it was said to be nothing more than a largely untrained militia fighting for their own personal interests. [...] Crucially, Marius dropped the requirement for land ownership. This opened the door to tens of thousands of jobless, aimless men to fight for Rome. They were promised adventure and, most importantly, a wage.\n\nHe took his time and trained his legions in his own vision. Some of the Gaius Marius facts we do know is that he devised new tactics for warfare and legion structure and even redesigned weapons. He now had under his command a professional, disciplined army. His reforms have been described as some of the most significant changes the Roman army would ever experience. He even offered his troops retirement benefits."
