      "snippet": "Marius\n\nMarius spent two years in Africa tending to local administration before returning to Rome. He won\nhis second consulship in 104 B.C., and shortly afterward achieved great renown\nfor defeating the Teutone and Cimbri invaders in northern Italy.\nThese victories brought him great\npopularity with both the people of Rome, and the army, and he was elected consul five years in\nsuccession, from 104 to 100 B.C., an unprecedented run. During this period he\nreorganized the army, an achievement that laid the ground work for the Roman legions of imperial\ndays. Under Marius, Rome established for the first time a standing army, manned by professional\nsoldiers. During this period Marius achieved great things for Rome, enjoyed immense popularity, and\nwas called the \"Third Founder of Rome.\" [...] # Marius\n\n## (Caius Marius)\n\n|  |\n\n| Marius |\n| MARIUS SITTING IN EXILE AMOUNG THE RUINS OF CARTHAGE |\n\nMarius was from a family of humble origin, but he distinguished himself as a great soldier and rose\nto the highest ranks of government. He fought first with Scipio Aemilianus\nin Spain, and later with\nMetellus in Africa. In the Jugurthine War he served with such\ndistinction that in 107 B.C. he was elected consul, and took over command.\nWithin a year he had captured many towns\nand nearly brought the war to a close but still hadn't captured Jugurtha. Eventually, his lieutenant\nSulla set up an ambush, and received credit for capturing Jugurtha. Unfortunately for Rome, this\nminor rivalry led to much more cataclysmic disputes in years to come.\n\n|  |"

      "snippet": "Marius worked with Saturninus and Saturninus's ally Glaucia to pass the land bill and banish Metellus Numidicus, but then distanced himself from them and their more radical policies. Around the start of the annual campaign season for the consulship, Marius attempted to disqualify Glaucia from standing for consul. Because other candidates would lower the chances of Glaucia's victory, Saturninus and Glaucia had an opponent – Gaius Memmius \"Gaius Memmius (proconsul of Macedonia)\") – killed during the consular elections for 99 BC. The elections then were delayed. The Senate responded to Saturninus's attempt, to by violence force through Glaucia's candidacy over Marius's disqualification, by issuing a senatus consultum ultimum, and – for the first time – ordered the magistrates to take [...] estimates vary from 100,000 to 200,000 being slain or captured. Marius sent Manius Aquillius \"Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)\") with a report to Rome that said 37,000 superbly trained Romans had succeeded in defeating over 100,000 Germans in two engagements. [...] It would seem that even at this early stage of his military career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He was elected on the basis of his accomplishments, even though he was not known by sight to the electors, as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes. After election, he likely served Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus on the Balearic Islands, helping him win a triumph. Next, Marius possibly ran for the quaestorship after losing an election for local office in Arpinum. He may have stood for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to a local competitor. It is possible, however, that Marius never ran for the quaestorship at all, jumping directly to plebeian tribune. He likely participated in the major Roman victory at the Battle of the"

      "snippet": "Although Marius was a successful general, he failed as politician. His successive consulships are attributable not to political adroitness but to his skill as a general at a time when Rome was severely threatened. The year 100 marked a turning point in Marius’s career. Elected consul for the sixth time and immensely popular after his recent victories, Marius devised no program for social reform beyond that of acquiring land for his veterans. Inept as a public speaker and vacillating in his political decisions, Marius allowed himself to be led by the demagogues Saturninus and Glaucia, whose radicalism and violence precipitated his fall. Driven by ambition, Marius spent the remaining years of his life trying to recover his former power and prestige. At his death, Rome had entered a new era [...] After returning to Rome, Marius began his political career. With the help of the powerful Metelli clan, he won the election for tribune of the people in 119 b.c.e. During his tribuneship, he showed his independence by carrying a bill for election reform despite opposition from the Metelli and the Senatorial Party. In the next year Marius stood for the office of aedile but was defeated. In 115 b.c.e. he was elected praetor but only with difficulty. In the following year he was appointed propraetor for Further Spain. About the year 111 b.c.e. Marius contracted a highly favorable marriage alliance with the ancient Julian clan. His marriage to Julia, a future aunt of Julius Caesar, gave him an important link to the aristocracy.\n\n## Life’s Work [...] Marius is particularly known for his military reforms, including the recruitment of volunteers from the lower classes, which transformed the Roman army into a professional fighting force. This shift not only enhanced military effectiveness but also changed soldiers' loyalties from the state to their generals, laying the groundwork for future political upheaval. Despite his military successes, Marius struggled politically, especially during his later years, where his ambition led him into tumultuous alliances that ultimately resulted in his political downfall. He died in 86 BCE, leaving behind a legacy marked by military innovation but marred by his failures in political leadership amidst Rome's growing civil discord.\n\n## Gaius Marius\n\nRoman general"

      "snippet": "Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship [...] the Vercellae, near modern Rovigo in the Po River valley, and the danger was over. This was the apex of Marius’ success. He had been consul every year since 104, and he was elected again the year 100. With Catulus he celebrated a joint triumph, but already there was bad feeling between them. Marius claimed the whole credit for the victory; Catulus and Sulla gave very different accounts of the event in their memoirs. [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career"

      "snippet": "Although details of his early career in the legions are uncertain, it’s generally agreed that he served under General Scipio Aemilianus in Numantia – the modern-day province of Soria in central Spain. Serving under Aemilanus, one of Rome’s most distinguished generals, provided Marius with valuable insights into military strategy and leadership. According to Greek philosopher Plutarch, Marius was highly regarded during this period, and spoken of as a potential future successor to Aemilanus.\n\n### Gaius Marius: The Politician\n\nGaius Marius: The Politician (Photo: Michael Nicholson via Getty Images) [...] However, his political career soon took a turn for the worse as he got embroiled in the escalating conflict between the populares and optimates factions. In 88 BC, Marius found himself opposing his former ally, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, in a power struggle that ultimately led to Sulla marching on Rome and seizing control.\n\nForced to flee the city, Marius spent a period in exile in North Africa. He returned to Rome in 87 BC, leading an army alongside the populist general Lucius Cornelius Cinna. The two were successful in capturing Rome and ousting Sulla’s supporters, paving the way for Marius’ unprecedented seventh consulship. However, his final term as consul was marred by a brutal purge of his political enemies, tarnishing his once-illustrious reputation. [...] Crucially, Marius dropped the requirement for land ownership. This opened the door to tens of thousands of jobless, aimless men to fight for Rome. They were promised adventure and, most importantly, a wage.\n\nHe took his time and trained his legions in his own vision. Some of the Gaius Marius facts we do know is that he devised new tactics for warfare and legion structure and even redesigned weapons. He now had under his command a professional, disciplined army. His reforms have been described as some of the most significant changes the Roman army would ever experience. He even offered his troops retirement benefits."
