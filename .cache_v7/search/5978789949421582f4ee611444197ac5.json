      "snippet": "In addition to hosting Thoughts on Tech & Things, Jason Michael Perry is the founder of PerryLabs, an AI consultancy helping businesses and institutions navigate the complexities of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and quantum computing. His experience includes more than two decades in the technology space working with Fortune 50 companies, government agencies, and startups. [...] Perry is a keynote speaker who has presented at events across the country, including AI Summit NYC, DC Startup & Tech Week, Black Is Tech, and Philly Tech Week. In 2023, he led the award-winning AI in A Minor, a first-of-its-kind collaboration with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, AWS, the Greater Baltimore Committee, and Mindgrub that blended classical music with machine learning. He also serves as a Senior Advisor to the World Trade Center Institute, leading its AGILE Global Innovation Series, a quarterly program convening executives and policymakers to explore how emerging technologies are reshaping industries. [...] \"The response has been overwhelming,\" said Perry. \"Technology is moving faster than most people can keep up with, and that gap creates confusion and fear. This show is about slowing down, asking better questions, and helping people see what's really changing and what's not in the tech shaping our world. Clearly, that message is resonating.\""
