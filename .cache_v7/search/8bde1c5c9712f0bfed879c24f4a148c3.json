      "snippet": "6 FUTURE WORK In addition to the improvement idea that has been already laid out, there remain also numerous op-portunities for further refinement and optimization of the showcased text-to-text game RAG-driven sys-tem. Future iterations could benefit from advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation technology, such as the Advanced and Modular RAG approaches (Gao et al., 2023), to enhance the quality and depth of the gaming experience. In this context, the findings of Lin et al (Lin et al., 2023) suggest a promising di-rection by integrating RAG with fine-tuning, which could help identify the optimal combination of these methods to improve the prototype. [...] The results demonstrated RAG’s superior perfor-mance over Non-RAG across multiple metrics. Auto-matic evaluation showed RAG outperforming GPT on all three metrics (NDCG, BertScore, Rouge-1), while manual evaluation revealed higher ATGE scores (3.85 versus 3.22). The RAG approach produced more ac-curate responses with stronger ethnographic ground-ing and fewer hallucinations. These findings validate RAG’s effectiveness for text-based LLM games in an-thropology and suggest its potential for educational game development. [...] The naive RAG (Gao et al., 2023) process be-gins with the cleansing and extraction of data from the original anthropological text, followed by ’chunk-ing’ it into smaller, manageable pieces. These chunks are transformed into vector representations and stored in a database for efficient retrieval. When a user in-teracts with the anthropological game, their input is converted into a vector representation, and the sys-tem retrieves the most relevant text chunks based on similarity scores. While the naive RAG approach has known limitations in retrieval and generation quality (Gao et al., 2023), its application to anthropological games represents a novel contribution to the emerging corpus of literature on Retrieval Augmented Genera-tion."

Rags are often considered insignificant and can be discarded unless they complete a specific strategy or hand.\n\n## When You Might Hear Or Use The Term Rag\n\nYou’ll hear ‘rag’ in conversations when players describe their hand strength, such as “I folded because I was holding a rag.” It’s also used to describe the board during community card games like Texas Hold’em, e.g., “The flop came down with all rags.”\n\n## In-Game Example [...] ## In-Game Example\n\nImagine you’re playing Texas Hold’em, and the flop shows 2, 5, and 9. These cards might be referred to as “rags” if they don’t improve your hand or create a potential draw.\n\n## Strategy / Tips\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nNo widely recognized alternative names exist for ‘rag’ in poker.\n\n## FAQs\n\nQ: Can rags ever be valuable?  \nA: Yes, if they complete a straight or flush, or when used in bluffing scenarios.\n\n## Related Terms\n\n## FOLLOW US\n\n## SECURE BANKING\n\n \n\n## SAFER GAMBLING\n\nOur Responsible Gambling program ensures all players are of legal age and provides options for self-exclusion from our tables, sportsbook, or casino.\n\n## Copyright © 2026 | AmericasCardroom.eu | T&Cs | All Rights Reserved\n\nCasino & Sportsbook\nCasino & Sportsbook\n\nCasino & Sportsbook"

The creation of a voice AI agent that uses RAG. OK, so I'm going to be using these step by step instructions and these are linked here in the video. So you can definitely take this and follow along at your own pace. And essentially what we're going to do is we're going to use the Ultravox Web application to build a corpus. Corpus is just what we call a service that allows you to bring in content. Or retrieval, augmented generation or RAG. And all the instructions are here and essentially what we're going to do is. I should just start with a with a bit of a background here. So I grew up in a family that plays tons of games, board games, card games. DICE games, I swear my dad and his siblings have"
