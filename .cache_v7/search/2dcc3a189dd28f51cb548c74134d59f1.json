      "snippet": "Dr. Dong has been actively conducting basic and applied research in the field of aquatic animal health since 2007. His research has centered on the discovery and characterization of aquatic pathogens, particularly infectious and emerging infectious diseases of economically important aquaculture species in Asia. His research group has investigated and developed detection methods for a number of emerging pathogens in tilapia, Asian sea bass, and whiteleg shrimp. He's also working on fish vaccine development and other disease-control strategies, such as nanobubble technology, and immunostimulants. He has authored over 75 international peer-reviewed articles related to this field.\n\nSelected news links: [...] ### Selected publications\n\n \n \n \n Linh N.V., Dien L.T., St-Hilaire S., Dong H.T. et al.

      "snippet": "This research showed that on average each patient received 3.1 injections. Compared to the results study in other countries, this rate is lower than result study of HAURI Global 2000 study16. However, this result is higher than Tu’s study17,18 and research by the Vietnam Nurses Association in 201014,19,20. About 37.6% nurses had been injured by sharp objects. The sharp injury rate at Ha Dong Hospital is higher than the results of Muc’s study14, Nguyen Tu’s 2005 study17, and lower than that of the Vong et al’s study in Cambodia21. Most of the injuries occurred in the morning. Unintended activities is the cause of most injuries. Meanwhile, sharp instruments injuries accounted for most of the fingers wounds. [...] 16.

[...] ## Conclusion\n\nDespite the high level of knowledge about safety injection, a low proportion of nurses performed correct safety injection practice. Moreover, the results demonstrated that experience might not always guarantee better practice. The findings raise the need for further training about this issue, especially among older nurses.\n\n## Data availability\n\nDataset 1: Raw data obtained from the questionnaire assessing knowledge for safe injection practice among nurses. doi, 10.5256/f1000research.11399.d16539023\n\nDataset 2: Raw data obtained from the observation assessing practice for safe injection practice among nurses. doi, 10.5256/f1000research.11399.d16539124"
