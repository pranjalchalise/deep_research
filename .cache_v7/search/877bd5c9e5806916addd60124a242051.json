Have an account? .\n\n Sam Altman said that AI would \"dramatically slow down\" how quickly OpenAI hires.\n Altman said the company will \"hire more slowly but keep hiring.\"\n Altman's comments came after a year when job growth stalled and hit young job seekers hard.\n\nSam Altman is addressing AI's impact on the workforce, including on OpenAI's hiring practices.\n\nDuring a live-streamed town hall event on Monday, catered mainly toward developers, the OpenAI CEO said that AI has changed how quickly the company expands its head count, but the company is not in a hiring freeze and is nowhere close to doing away with human employees entirely. [...] \"We are planning to dramatically slow down how quickly we grow because we think we'll be able to do so much more with fewer people,\" said Altman in response to a participant who asked if AI has changed OpenAI's interview process of potential candidates.\n\n\"What I think we shouldn't do, and what I hope other companies won't do either, is hire super aggressively, then realize all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation,\" Altman added. \"So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.\" [...] Business Insider previously reported that, while in 2022 there were roughly two job openings for every unemployed worker, by September 2025 that ratio had fallen to one. Workers who have been jobless for at least 27 weeks also now make up about a quarter of all unemployed Americans.\n\nBased on data from the US Census Bureau, young workers have been hit especially hard by the hiring slowdown. The unemployment rate for Americans ages 20 to 24 reached 9.2% in August and September, the highest level since the recovery from the pandemic recession.\n\n Artificial Intelligence\n Employment\n Hiring\n More\n Unemployment\n Business\n Technology\n Economy\n Careers\n Work\n Layoffs\n\n## Read next\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know"

      "snippet": "Altman also praised Trump's leadership in his message and expressed hope that the president could cool tensions — the latest example of a CEO attempting to balance being critical of actions tied to the Trump administration's policies while also staying on the president's good side.\n\n\"President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country,\" Altman wrote. \"I am encouraged by the last few hours of response and hope to see trust rebuilt with transparent investigations.\"\n\nAs a general principle, Altman wrote that OpenAI tries to \"stick to our convictions and not get blown around by changing fashions too much.\" [...] \"I love the US and its values of democracy and freedom and will be supportive of the country however I can; OpenAI will too,\" the OpenAI CEO wrote in an internal Slack message. \"But part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach. What's happening with ICE is going too far.\"\n\nOpenAI employees responded positively to Altman's message on Slack, including heart and thank-you emojis.\n\nAltman's message, which was first reported by The New York Times' Dealbook newsletter, comes as CEO and tech leaders face internal and external pressures in the wake of ICE's deadly shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday. Pretti is the second person to be fatally shot by federal law enforcement amid a surge in immigration enforcement in and around Minneapolis.

      "snippet": "Andrew here. On Monday, I wrote here about the need for C.E.O.s to speak up after this weekend’s tragic shooting in Minneapolis. Credit to Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, who wrote in an internal Slack message to the company: “What’s happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.”\n\nWe’ve got the full note. That, and much more, below.\n\n## “Going too far”\n\nDealBook has raised the question of whether business leaders would begin to speak out against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after federal agents killed two Americans in Minnesota. [...] More have started doing so — including Sam Altman of OpenAI — as corporate America is forced to confront the matter.\n\n“What’s happening with ICE is going too far,” Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to OpenAI employees, DealBook has learned. Here’s the full text of his message: [...] > I love the US and its values of democracy and freedom and will be supportive of the country however I can; OpenAI will too. But part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach. What’s happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.\n>\n> President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country. I am encouraged by the last few hours of response and hope to see trust rebuilt with transparent investigations.\n>"

      "title": "Anthropic and OpenAI CEOs condemn ICE violence, praise Trump - TechCrunch",
      "snippet": "Amodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an independent investigation into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Alex Pretti’s death  circulated online. (It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a growing number of Republicans have begun to call for an investigation, as well.)\n\nIn Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.” [...] Amodei focused on the importance of preserving democracy at home, both on NBC and in a post on X that specifically called out “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” On NBC, he said he’s a believer in arming democracies to defend against autocratic countries, and that “we need to defend our own democratic values at home.” He added that Anthropic has no contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nMeanwhile, in an internal Slack message to OpenAI employees that got leaked to the New York Times, Sam Altman said, “What’s happening with ICE is going too far.” [...] Altman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities.\n\nJ.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”"

      "title": "A Reckoning for the Tech Right - The Atlantic",
      "snippet": "Altman reportedly rebuked the administration in an internal post to OpenAI employees, writing that “what’s happening with ICE is going too far.” He added that the president is “a very strong leader,” who he hopes “will rise to this moment and unite the country.” [...] Silicon Valley’s top executives have seemingly taken every opportunity to cozy up to Trump. During his inauguration a year ago, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, and Cook sat smiling behind the president in the Capitol Rotunda. The obsequiousness has not stopped since: In August, Cook presented Trump with a custom plaque atop a 24-karat-gold base in the Oval Office. At a White House dinner the next month, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin praised Trump’s “civil rights” work, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman described Trump’s leadership as a “refreshing change.” Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are among the companies that have made donations to fund the new White House ballroom. [...] This all risks being a short-term, transactional game. In the long run, tech executives’ alignment with the president could easily backfire. “The Trump supporters in Silicon Valley are making the same mistake as all powerful people who back authoritarians,” the venture capitalist Michael Moritz warned in 2024. “They are, I suspect, seduced by the notion that because of their means, they will be able to control Trump.” But Trump is mercurial: He will do as he pleases. As tech executives continue schmoozing with the president, there are no guarantees they will get anything in return.\n\n### About the Author\n\nLila Shroff\n\nLila Shroff is an assistant editor at The Atlantic.\n\nExplore More Topics\n\nAmazon, Apple, Donald Trump, Google, Minneapolis, OpenAI, Sam Altman, Silicon Valley, White House"
