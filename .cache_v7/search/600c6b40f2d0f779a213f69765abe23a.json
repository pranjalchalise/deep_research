I just got accepted into Rice and Amherst College as an international student (junior year, linguistics major (hoping to focus more on psycholinguistics in the future). I’m super torn between the two because both are wonderful schools in different ways. My interest in linguistics (the linguistic topics that originally drove me into the field) requires combining psychology, cog sci, psychoanalysis, philosophy, and more (at least that’s how I hope to approach the subject). I also love visual arts, Chinese traditional art, classical music, and just art in general. I’m looking for a place that: 1. offers courses on most of the above-mentioned fields. 2. has enough research opportunities for undergrads 3. provides more support and guidance on future career planning 4. has a great and tight [...] Fewer discussions and resources on job opportunities/ future career paths. I get that, and correct me if I’m wrong, Amherst College has a great Alumni network but it works mostly for people in the pre-med/ pre-law/ consulting track, which is not the case for me.\n\nMost people in my country do not know anything about Amherst College, which I personally do not care, but it’s a concern for my parents so it’s a concern for me since they are the ones that pay my tuition fees.\n\nNo summer semesters so I won’t be able to graduate on time (gonna have to spend one more semester)"

How prestigious is Amherst college really? (international student here who doesn't really know alot about LAC's) I was really lucky to receive acceptances from Amherst College and a couple more well known universities (more well known from this part of the world at-least). At Amherst I plan on majoring in Economics and Physics and pipeline to finance. I didn't know anything about Amherst or any other LAC before this admission cycle but i grew to truly love Amherst's vibe and smaller community. On top of all of that, Amherst has also given me a massive amount of aid. I’m an international student and from where I’m from no one really knows Amherst college. My question is how prestigious is Amherst college in the States and would it provide me with the same opportunities and academic experience as a more well known university. Prestige is something that I wish I could say I didn't care about whatsoever, but I sadly do. It's not enough for me to turn down thousands of dollars of aid but still.

It's bougie as all hell don't get me wrong but there's a lot of neat shops and good places to eat.
