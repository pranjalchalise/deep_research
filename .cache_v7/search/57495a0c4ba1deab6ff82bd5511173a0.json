For Clodius’ profile picture, creativity was needed, as there are no (extant) depictions of him. In the end, I thought just as some modern social media users have an image of a character from a favourite TV show as their profile picture, an Ancient Roman equivalent could be an image of a Greek theatre mask. I thought this would also match the ‘relatable’ image Clodius aimed to cultivate. The mask I selected bears a mischievous smile, which further suits Clodius’ character. His username, ‘@therealclOdius’, parallels those of some real celebrities (including Trump) in its assertion that this is the ‘real’ him, and not an imposter; the [...] For my characterisation of Clodius, I drew on the image of him as a demagogue. He seemed to have attracted something of a personality cult, similar to today’s supporters of the likes of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Though Clodius ‘belonged to one of the most illustrious houses in Rome’, he used the ‘non-elite’ pronunciation of his name, and enjoyed considerable popular support as a result of such ‘symbolic gestures of solidarity’. As with Cicero, I explain specific choices in each case, but generally I depict Clodius as more willing to use internet slang, emojis, memes etc., in order to make himself appear more ‘relatable’ to his supporters (as the likes of Trump and Musk do on their social media accounts). I also do not use capitals when typing his messages, as some on the internet tend [...] I depict Clodius sharing a meme based on the popular ‘Disaster Girl’ template, part of his attempts to appear relatable to his followers. Aware of the power of social media to attract popularity, he has given his supporters a nickname, and uses hashtags. Clodius encourages his followers to engage with him to make them feel on a level with him, despite the vast discrepancies in status and power which in reality exist between them. To Clodius’ personality cult, he can do no wrong. They are an online equivalent to the mobs that rallied around him."

[...] In the 1981 Franco-Italian film Caligula and Messalina, he was portrayed by Gino Turini (as John Turner).\n The 1985 made-for-television miniseries A.D. features actor Richard Kiley as Claudius.

      "snippet": "History\n Politics, Institutions, and Public Opinion\n\nThe Roman Emperor Claudius, who reigned from 41 to 54 AD, was never supposed to be emperor. He came to office at age 50, an old man in Roman times. Claudius succeeded the charismatic, youthful heartthrob Caligula—son of the beloved Germanicus and the “little boot” who turned out to be a narcissist monster before being assassinated in office. [...] The stereotyped impression of Claudius was that of a simpleton not to be taken seriously—and so no one did. Claudius himself claimed that he feigned acting differently in part so that he would not be targeted by enemies before he assumed power, and to unnerve them afterwards.\n\nContemporary critics laughed at his apparent lack of eloquence and rhetorical mastery, leading some scholars to conjecture that he may have suffered from Tourette syndrome or a form of autism. The court biographer Suetonius wrote that Claudius “was now careful and shrewd, sometimes hasty and inconsiderate, occasionally silly and like a crazy man.”\n\nSound familiar? [...] Later Roman historians, drawing on now lost contemporary accounts of Claudius, reflect the same prejudices. In the biography of Suetonius and throughout the Annals of the historian Tacitus, the accidental emperor Claudius comes off as little more than an impulsive bumbler, an accidental emperor who came to power on a fluke and whose lack of Julian elegance made him more a buffoon than the head of the global Roman Empire of some 60 million citizens.\n\nClaudius’s 50 years of private life before becoming emperor were also the stuff of court gossip and ridicule. He would marry four times and was often flattered and manipulated by younger women.\n\nModern historians, however, have corrected that largely negative view and ancient bias."

His Family Was Cruel\n\nClaudius’ perceived weakness was a source of great shame for his family, and they completely ostracized him as a child. His mother was especially cruel, repeatedly referring to the young boy as a monster and holding him up as the standard for stupidity. The emperor-to-be was probably relieved when she finally figured out how to get rid of him.\n\nClaudiusI, Claudius trailer, AcornMediaUS\n\nClaudius\n\n## 6. He Got Sent Away [...] Roman King with common people\n\n## 39. He Had A Short Fuse\n\nClaudius had a reputation for his temper just as much as his relatability. He was incredibly quick to angerand would often have fuming outbursts in public. To his credit, Claudius acknowledged this about himself and publicly apologized for his temper on at least one occasion. He would often channel this passionate anger into his favorite non-academic pastime.\n\nGettyimages - 629450197, Claudius Emperor Roman Man Universal Images Group, Getty Images\n\nGettyimages - 629450197, Claudius Emperor Roman Man \n\n## 40.

Upon Augustus’ demise, a delegation of equites (the propertied class ranked below the senatorial class) elected Claudius to lead them.\n\nWhen Claudius’ house burned down, the Senate requested it rebuilt with public money and further requested Claudius cleared to debate in the Senate, showing the positive sentiment that existed toward the young historian. While Tiberius denied both these proposals, his successor perhaps saw Claudius’ political value."

      "snippet": "Because of his perceived uselessness, he spent much of his life overlooked. But being overlooked gave Claudius time for other pursuits, pursuits that in many ways were just as dangerous: history. One of Claudius’ many faults was his honesty, and Rome was not the place to write honestly about those in power. His family quickly put a stop to his writings, but the damage had been done; now, he was viewed as entirely unsuitable for public office. He was snubbed several times for any sort of position until the reign of Emperor Caligula, when he was appointed co-consul (more because of his deceased father than for his own skills). [...] might be more indicative of an isolated and fearful childhood than a mental deficit. For centuries, the accounts of these historians were believed, but with the rediscovery of some of Claudius’ writings such as his “Letter to the Alexandrians,” which demonstrates his reversal of Caligula’s incendiary policies and belief in the rights of Jews, this perception is changing. but the lack of records from Claudius' reign makes it difficult to obtain an accurate picture; for all we know, perhaps those that survive show his only few good decisions. [...] Contrasting answers to the veracity of Claudius’ claims have emerged; many ancient historians describe Claudius as crude, with a propensity towards gluttony and the pleasures of the flesh, as well as a great lover of games and gladiatorial events, the bloodier the better. He was also a voracious gambler, to the point of addiction, and he \"[ate] himself to sleep\" often. Even within these depictions, however, there are contradictions; Claudius is painted as trusting, oft-confused, and easily manipulated by women, but also paranoid and cruel. Yet these stand in stark contrast to Claudius’ own writings, which show a dedicated public servant, intelligent and well-read. Now, it seems possible that Claudius' rather stunted social development might be more indicative of an isolated and fearful"

In particular, I explore what effect mass (re)production had on the imperial image in the Roman world. Although representations of the emperor on large media and in important locations were often tightly controlled, on small media that were mass-produced, the image of the emperor escaped the control of the imperial authorities. Paradoxically, this meant that the imperial image increased in power, gathering innumerable associations and meanings as a ‘shared’ image. Allowing the inhabitants of the Roman Empire to be co-creators of imperial ideology meant that ultimately a more personalised, and thus more powerful, connection to the emperor was generated.
