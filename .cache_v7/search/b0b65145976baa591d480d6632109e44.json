      "snippet": "In the world of fashion, we might talk about 'braces' (usually in the plural) as those elastic straps that hold up trousers, a synonym for suspenders. And if you've ever had dental work done, you'll be familiar with 'braces' – the appliances that help correct misaligned teeth. Even in the maritime world, a brace is a rope used to control the position of a yard on a square-rigged ship. It’s quite a versatile term, isn't it?\n\nSo, the next time you hear or use the word 'brace,' take a moment to consider the context. Are we talking about structural integrity, personal fortitude, a pair of items, punctuation, fashion, or even dental alignment? It’s a word that, in its many forms, reflects a fundamental human need for support, preparation, and organization.\n\n## You Might Also Like [...] But 'brace' isn't just about physical support. It can also be about preparing yourself for something tough. When you brace yourself for bad news, you're mentally steeling yourself, getting ready to face something unpleasant or difficult. It's that internal tightening, that readiness for impact. It's a verb that speaks to our resilience, our ability to face challenges head-on.

'Brace' is definitely one of those words. We often hear it in contexts where something needs to be held steady or strengthened, right? Think about a carpenter adding a triangular piece of wood to a corner to make it more rigid – that's a brace, a structural member designed to stiffen a framework. Or perhaps you've seen someone wearing a knee brace after an injury; that's another kind of brace, a support that steadies and strengthens a specific body part. It's all about providing stability."

      "snippet": "## Conclusion\n\nThe current qualitative research found that the long treatment period with a brace creates extremely tiring conditions for adolescents, which will ultimately cause non-compliance with the brace. Accepting brace therapy is a big challenge, given the significant change it causes in an adolescent’s appearance. Adolescents are involved in disease and treatment for a long time without any preparation, which affects their whole individual and social lives. The psychological burden after the diagnosis and the start of treatment may be higher than the usual capacity of the adolescent at this age. Also, staying away from a series of recreations and physical activities that adolescents like makes excuses and unwillingness to wear braces regularly. [...] Brace compliance may be quite laborious due to the significant changes in adolescents’ appearance with a brace. Moreover, adolescents are in a formative growth stage, exhibit greater mood sensitivity to the environment, and resist change [6, 7]. Due to these difficulties and some unknown reasons impacting brace compliance, researchers discovered that nearly half of adolescents with spinal deformities do not follow treatment instructions and stop wearing the braces [8, 9]. [...] The adolescent’s transition from the difficult initial conditions of brace therapy and the formation of the compliance process requires deep understanding, special attention, and support in all aspects from family, treatment team, and friends.\n\n## Supporting information\n\n### S1 Table.

Longer monitoring periods are needed, to better understand the efficacy of brace treatment and to point out all factors involved in the adolescent idiopathic scoliosis treatment. The opportunity to measure real compliance by monitoring all patients until the end of therapy, will allow a deeper analysis about the real efficacy of brace treatment.\n\n## Competing interests\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n## Authors' contributions [...] Other limits of this study are the heterogeneous sample of patients analized and the little average period of monitoring (5.5 months). This study would be significantly strengthened by removing the subjects that were selectively enrolled after treatment had already begun: nevertheless, this was done in all main analysis.\n\nSomeone should advocate that also the quality of brace wearing is important: in fact, wearing a spinal orthosis only does not mean giving an effective treatment to the patients with AIS, until the orthosis prescribed tightness is maintained. Future research should question not only quantity but also real quality of treatment, by using also biomechanical monitor measuring forces produced within the brace. [...] At brace prescription, if the physicians deemed it to be appropriate during the consultation, the patients’ families have been asked whether they wanted to check the compliance of their children to treatment through TB for clinical purposes: If this was the case, they had to buy TB, thus confirming their adherence to the project. TB was then applied by the orthotist during brace construction and the data was read by the treating physician at the next clinical evaluation. All parents of participating patients signed a consent form for clinical research. Because it was our institute’s first experience with the clinical introduction of the TB, some caution was applied at the beginning by the prescribing physicians, primarily for the purpose of avoiding any interference with a good"

Similar to the suggestion of Joarder et al. of qualitative research yielding more meaningful results with limited quantity, especially in individuals with AIS (37). Similarly, our qualitative research yielded more data, with individuals expressing their problems more effectively.

[...] force sensors (24). Despite this, participants in our study reported wearing the brace for an average of 20 h per day over a period of 18 months, indicating high compliance. This was associated with observed improvements in Cobb angles. Our findings further suggest that long-term brace use did not negatively impact quality of life (18), supporting the view that consistent compliance, especially when combined with effective in-brace correction, may help reduce potential negative effects on QoL. Moreover, although our study did not directly investigate psychological coping predictors, recent evidence suggests that variables such as age, gender, and prescribed brace duration may influence individual adaptation to bracing (25). Future research may benefit from exploring these characteristics [...] Brace treatment has been shown in the literature to be directly correlated with treatment effectiveness when the brace is worn consistently for the recommended duration (21). Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted that in-brace correction is a key predictor of treatment success, as greater initial correction may enable reduced wear time while still achieving comparable clinical outcomes and improved quality of life (22, 23). In our study, daily brace wear time was reported by participants and their parents through self-report. It is important to note that previous research has demonstrated that self-reported wear time often overestimates actual brace usage when compared to objective monitoring tools such as temperature or force sensors (24). Despite this, participants in our study"

      "snippet": "When it comes to lifting heavy, proper bracing is non-negotiable. Without a solid brace, you leak power, increase injury risk, and limit your strength potential. Despite its importance, many lifters—beginners and experienced alike—struggle with bracing effectively. Creating intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) through proper breathing and core engagement is key to a strong brace. Research has confirmed that the Valsalva maneuver, a breathing technique where you take a deep breath and hold it while exerting force, significantly increases trunk stability, reducing spinal compression while allowing lifters to generate more force safely. However, many lifters make critical mistakes when attempting to brace, often misunderstanding how to breathe and engage their core effectively. This article will [...] Bracing vs. Hollowing: Core Engagement Differences\n\nMany lifters mistakenly believe that drawing in their stomach (abdominal hollowing) is an effective way to brace. However, research has demonstrated that abdominal bracing—contracting the core in a 360-degree pattern—engages more musculature and provides superior spinal stability (Tsartsapakis, 2023).\n\nEMG studies confirm that bracing activates the rectus abdominis, obliques, and spinal erectors more effectively than hollowing, which primarily activates only the transverse abdominis (Tsartsapakis, 2023). Strength athletes should focus on expanding and contracting their core outward rather than pulling the belly inward to maintain rigidity under heavy loads.\n\nLifting Belts: A Tool, Not a Crutch [...] Verro\nVerro\n\n# The Science of Bracing When Lifting: How to Generate More Power and Reduce Injury Risk\n\n#### Key Points:\n\nProper bracing increases spinal stability, reduces injury risk, and maximizes strength output.\n\nScientific research supports intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), diaphragmatic breathing, and the Valsalva maneuver as essential for heavy lifting.\n\nCommon mistakes include chest breathing, weak core engagement, over-reliance on a belt, and improper timing of breath control.\n\nStudies confirm that bracing (not hollowing) activates more core musculature and provides greater spinal support.\n\nPractical drills like belly breathing, Valsalva maneuver practice, and core stability exercises help refine bracing technique.\n\n#### Introduction"
