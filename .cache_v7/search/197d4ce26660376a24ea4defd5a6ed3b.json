All arenas, lots of pve content. I don't want to rebuild him constantly. He is 5\\ blessed in cruelty right now. Will move to CR at 6\\, and has a cats gaze at level 5. gear is six piece merciless, 2 piece cruel\n\nBuild 1:\n\nDef: 7802\n\nSpd: 219\n\nCD: 358\n\nACC: 250\n\nBuild 2:\n\nDef: 7408 \\\n\nSpd: 203 \\\n\nCD: 358\n\nACC: 375 \\\n\nThe difference is in an ACC/ACC banner (banner with acc ascension) that trades for a faster DEF/DEF banner. I think in principle I can make up some of the defense by rerolling his glove and chest piece, which have bad ascension rolls (both flat def) to something like cd/def or def acc. [...] Use Promo Codes: Utilize new player promo codes to get additional strong champions. \"Did you use the code monkeyking to start? Free top 20 Legendary .. if you didnt its worth restarting\"\n\nGear and Masteries: Focus on gearing your champions well and unlocking masteries to maximize their potential. \"Getting him geared well is next. Since you have skeletor I'm guessing you got perception gear rather than lifesteal which is too bad since lifesteal is great for an early campaign farmer.\"\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can build a strong foundation in RAID: Shadow Legends and progress through the game more efficiently.\n\n### Related Media\n\n<<rtjson>>{\"c\":[{\"e\":\"ra:imagecard\",\"entity\\_id\":\"t3\\_1jqdl6z\",\"entity\\_type\":\"post\",\"height\":472,\"src\":\"<</rtjson>>\n\n### RAID Game Communities"

      "snippet": "Josif Grabocka, graphic\n\nWe as a community are also to blame, because most of our papers claim to be the state-of-the-art in performance, i.e., empirically more accurate than all the existing methods. Part of the problem might be mitigated if authors were more humble and focused on specific, narrow-scope hypotheses.\n\nAnirbit Mukherjee, graphic\n\nFor a recent theory submission at a conference we got a complaint from the reviewer that our review of literature was too extensive and occupying too many pages :) Sometimes it goes the other way too :) I really thought we needed to do a more than usual literature review because our work was trying to glue two separate areas of ML which generally don't occur together.\n\nAyan Banerjee, graphic [...] 1. The authors showed results on benchmark XYZ. However, it is already shown in paper [...] that in real-world applications, benchmarks have some other traits [name them!] that should also be studied to show the impact of the proposed approach.\n2. Baseline XYZ is missing in the experiments, but we know from paper [...] that XYZ outperforms \\all\\ the baselines studied in the paper at hand. Therefore, the authors have not compared against the state of the art but should do so. [Note: I don't believe that it is worthwhile to compare against further baselines that perform only well on niche tasks if these niche tasks are not the focus of the paper.] [...] Why is this a Problem? A priori, it is unclear how many comparisons against other baselines and on other benchmarks are actually needed to show the benefit of your approach. And it will always be unknown. However, unjustifiably asking for yet another baseline or benchmark is not scientific in my opinion. A good experiment section does try to empirically answer research questions. Therefore, I believe that if reviewers ask for yet another baseline or benchmark, they should also give some valid reason why this would be beneficial/insightful to answer an important research question of the paper at hand.
