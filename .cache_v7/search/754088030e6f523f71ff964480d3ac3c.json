      "title": "R. C. Sproul's Legacy: Theology Is for Everyday Believers",
      "snippet": "In 1994, Ligonier launched a daily radio show (and later podcast), Renewing Your Mind. Sproul carved out a niche in a crowded field by focusing on theological teaching rather than traditional sermon series. He wrote a raft of books, booklets, articles, and chapters of various types. While some of this material was geared for a more academic audience, most were written to equip thoughtful laypeople and fortify ministers to be battlefield pastoral theologians.\n\nHis other noteworthy books included Knowing Scripture (1978), Classical Apologetics (1984), Pleasing God (1988), Faith Alone (1995), Everyone’s a Theologian (2014), several anthologies of Tabletalk articles, the 28-volume Crucial Question series, and the six-volume Saint Andrew’s Expositional Commentary Series. [...] Sproul has placed an indelible mark on the evangelical movement. He made philosophy accessible and demonstrated the value of apologetics. He spread Reformed theology widely and reinforced the value of systematic theology and church history. He championed biblical inerrancy and defended the reformational view of justification in an era when both were hotly debated.\n\nHe was captivated by a vision of God’s holiness, which permeated his teaching and writing ministry. But what stands out most about Sproul is that the driving force behind all these efforts was a vision of theological education for everyday believers. Sproul believed that theology enables all Christians to think rightly about God and his world for the sake of living rightly before God in his world. [...] He was also a staunch Calvinist who affirmed Reformed theology long before there was a Young, Restless, and Reformed movement. His books such as The Holiness of God (1984), Chosen by God (1986), Grace Unknown (1997), and the New Geneva Study Bible (1995; later the Reformation Study Bible) contributed to the revival of Calvinism among evangelicals in the final two decades of the 20th century."

      "title": "A Second Critique of R. C. Sproul on the Love of God",
      "snippet": "Me now: In the chart and in my analysis, I am associating God's \"special love of benevolence\" as simply His love of election, which means His purpose to grace the elect the gift of faith in order to put them in Christ, so that they may attain to the eschatological adoption as sons or full glorification. Special love of benevolence, simply considered as electing love, is unconditional in that sense. God will give the elect faith in Christ apart from any qualifications in them. But once they walk in the obedience of that God-wrought faith, they please Him, since they are now participating in His holiness, as renewed creatures being conformed unto the moral image of His son. They are not loved with what I have called God's \"moral love of complacency\" until they are walking obediently as [...] R. C. Sproul himself, in his book “Loved by God,” acknowledges that God has a love for all people in this sense. He, like all of the Reformed theologians in the past, associates God’s “common grace” with God’s universal, benevolent love. [...] It is this latter teaching about God’s holy hatred for sin and sinners that is regularly omitted in evangelistic encounters. That’s the problem. No one is actually saying that “God loves all people unconditionally is the gospel.” The reason that theological balance is lacking today is because so few actually know about the complexity involved in the biblical teaching regarding the love of God (hence the need for D. A Carson’s book on “The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God”), and so they therefore don’t have a good understanding about the complex teaching of the hatred of God either. The two doctrines (i.e. God’s holy love and holy hatred) are interrelated. Faithful expositions on the meaning of the cross of Christ in evangelistic encounters must therefore present both doctrines,"

      "snippet": "The 1970s saw the beginning of R.C.’s writing career. The first several titles show the range of his teaching and interests: The Symbol: An Exposition of the Apostles’ Creed (P&R, 1973); The Psychology of Atheism(Bethany, 1974), Discovering the Intimate Marriage(Bethan, 1975), and The Inerrant Word,general editor (Bethany, 1975). He would go on to write or edit over 60 books, including a novel, a biography, and several children’s books. [...] You can grieve for me the week before I die, if I’m scared and hurting, but when I gasp that last fleeting breath and my immortal soul flees to heaven, I’m going to be jumping over fire hydrants down the golden streets, and my biggest concern, if I have any, will be my wife back here grieving.\n\nWhen I die, I will be identified with Christ’s exaltation. But right now, I’m identified with His affliction.\n\nAnd in an article entitled “Death Does Not Have the Last Word,” he wrote:\n\nWhen we close our eyes in death, we do not cease to be alive; rather, we experience a continuation of personal consciousness.\n\nNo person is more conscious, more aware, and more alert than when he passes through the veil from this world into the next. [...] I am not afraid of death. I believe that death for the Christian is a glorious transition to heaven. I am not afraid of going to heaven. It’s the process that frightens me. I don’t know by what means I will die. It may be via a process of suffering, and that frightens me.\n\nI know that even this shouldn’t frighten me. There are lots of things that frighten me that I shouldn’t let frighten me. The Scripture declares that perfect love casts out fear. But love is still imperfect, and fear hangs around.\n\nHe wrote about what it would be like to be in heaven and identified with Christ:"

      "title": "The Five R.C. Sproul Books That Had the Biggest Impact on Me",
      "snippet": "What We Believe\n\nDr. Sproul’s book What We Believe is a commentary on the Apostles’ Creed. This book was instrumental in sparking my interest in the theology of the early church. Because the Apostles’ Creed is included or explained in so many Reformed catechisms and confessions, it also helped me begin to see some of the continuity between the early church and the Reformation. This book is also characteristic of Dr. Sproul in that he did not get sidetracked by some of the louder debates over secondary and tertiary issues. He was focused on the essentials—the doctrine of God and the gospel. By the way, this book was Dr. Sproul’s first book, originally published in 1973 as The Symbol.\n\nDr. Keith Mathison is Professor of Systematic Theology at Reformation Bible College in Sanford, Fla. [...] Chosen by God\n\nChosen by God is Dr. Sproul’s classic introduction to the doctrines of predestination and election. For many of those introduced to Reformed theology by Dr. Sproul, these doctrines are enormous stumbling blocks. They certainly were for me. This book was an eye-opener because it forced me to come to grips with the fact that these doctrines are not man-made doctrines. They are found repeatedly in the Bible itself. I was forced to realize that if I rejected these doctrines I was rejecting the teaching of Scripture.\n\nWhat is Reformed Theology? [...] One of Dr. Sproul’s greatest legacies is his involvement with the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy that produced the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy. When the doctrine of inerrancy was under attack, he helped organize the Council that would do much to reestablish the foundations of this important biblical teaching. Not only did they publish the Chicago Statement, the various theologians involved published multiple academic works defending inerrancy from nearly every conceivable objection. Dr. Sproul himself was asked to write the official commentary on the Chicago Statement. His commentary is a very helpful explanation of what the Council intended with each affirmation and denial. The book Scripture Alone contains several of Dr. Sproul’s more academic works on the"
