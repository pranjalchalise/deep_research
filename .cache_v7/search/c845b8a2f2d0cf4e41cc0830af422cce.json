      "snippet": "Lee’s research in cryobiology extends from the South Pole to Miami’s backyard, where he collaborates with Jon Costanzo, adjunct professor of biology, and student researchers to study the wood frog, which can freeze solid in winter.\n\nLee has published more than 300 refereed journal articles, reviews and book chapters and he has edited or authored four books. He holds a patent for the use of ice nucleating microorganisms for biological control.\n\nLee is also active in providing professional development opportunities for teachers, receiving more than $2.7 million in grants to support these activities. For 15 years, he co-directed an environmental science program for Ohio elementary teachers taught at a field station in Wyoming. [...] Since 2004, University Distinguished Professor of Biology Richard Lee has studied this extremeophile, the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica. This wingless midge is the only true insect found on Antarctica, and it is considered the continent’s largest terrestrial animal (it’s only 2-6 mm, less than a quarter of an inch long).\n\nIts unusual survival mechanisms include the ability to tolerate freezing and dehydration, surviving the loss of 70 percent of their body water, Lee said. Most animals won't survive losing more than 20 percent.\n\nLee is internationally recognized for his research on physiological and ecological mechanisms of cold tolerance, dormancy and the winter ecology of temperate and polar insects and other ectotherms. [...] His field research includes work on Ellesmere Island in the High Arctic and 10 field seasons on the Antarctic Peninsula — his most recent research expedition was just last year.\n\nLee was also part of a team that sequenced the genome of B. antarctica — the first for an Antarctic animal.\n\nAs the first polar insect and first freeze-tolerant insect to be sequenced, B. antarctica offers a new opportunity for studying extremophile biology and insect genome evolution.\n\nLee’s research in Antarctica has been funded continuously by the National Science Foundation with more than $3 million since 2004."

      "snippet": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nBritish physicist\n\nEdward Lee (2 March 1914 – 31 December 2001) was a British scientist, inventor, and civil servant. He was the builder of Britain's first infrared spectrometer, and later served as Director of the Admiralty Research Laboratory.\n\n## Education\n\n[edit&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Education\")]\n\nLee was educated at Consett Grammar School. He earned an MSc from Manchester University, where he was a protégé of scientists Lawrence Bragg and Patrick Blackett. He was headhunted by Sir Gordon Sutherland to build an infrared spectrometer at Pembroke College, University of Cambridge, where he received his PhD.\n\n## Second World War career\n\n[edit&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Second World War career\")] [...] At the outbreak of the Second World War, Lee had won a Commonwealth scholarship to continue his research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but chose instead to remain in Britain to help with the war effort. In 1939, Lee joined the Scientific and Technical Staff at the Royal Navy's Admiralty Research Laboratory in Teddington, Middlesex. He served in the Scientific Research and Experiment Department working on radar & Type F infrared rays recognition system.\n\n## Post-war career\n\n[edit&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Post-war career\")] [...] From 1946 to 1948, Lee served on the staff of the UK Ministry of Defence. In 1948, he joined the Admiralty's Department of Physical Research. In 1951, he returned to the Admiralty Research Laboratory, and in 1955 he was appointed Director of Operational Research, Royal Naval Scientific Service."

      "snippet": "From 1997 to 2003, Lee was director of the RIKEN-BNL Research Center (now director emeritus), which together with other researchers from Columbia, completed a 1 teraflops supercomputer QCDSP for lattice QCD in 1998 and a 10 teraflops QCDOC machine in 2001.[citation needed] Leading up to 2005, Lee and Richard M. Friedberg developed a new method to solve the Schrödinger equation, leading to convergent iterative solutions for the long-standing quantum degenerate double-wall potential and other instanton problems. They also did work on the neutrino mapping matrix. [...] However, again disrupted by a further Japanese invasion, Lee continued at the National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming the next year in 1945, where he studied with Professor Wu Ta-You.\n\n### Life and research in the U.S.\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Wu Experiment and Weak Interaction\n\nProfessor Wu nominated Lee for a Chinese government fellowship for graduate study in the United States. In 1946, Lee went to the University of Chicago and was selected by Professor Enrico Fermi to become his PhD student. Lee received his PhD under Fermi in 1950 for his research work Hydrogen Content of White Dwarf Stars. Lee served as research associate and lecturer in physics at the University of California at Berkeley from 1950 to 1951. [...] Lee was one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to \"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n## Educational activities\n\n[edit]\n\n|  |\n\n| This section does not cite any sources.

He developed a model for studying various quantum phenomena known as the \"Lee model.\" [...] In 1957, Lee was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics together with Chen-Ning Yang for work exploring the symmetry of subatomic particles as they interact with the force that holds atoms together. At 31, Lee was the second-youngest scientist to receive the distinction.\n\nHe won many other accolades including the Albert Einstein Award in Science, the Galileo Galilei Medal and the G.
