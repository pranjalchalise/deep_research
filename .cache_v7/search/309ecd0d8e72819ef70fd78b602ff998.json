      "snippet": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines a retrieval model with a generative model. It retrieves related information from a database or document set and uses it to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This approach enhances the quality of AI-generated text by grounding it in real-world data, making it particularly useful for tasks like answering questions, summarizing, and creating content.\n RAG improves AI-generated content by incorporating external data. It retrieves relevant information from a database and then uses that data to generate more accurate and context-aware responses. This process ensures that the AI system’s output is better informed and more reliable. [...] RAG architecture enables AI systems to produce more informed and reliable content by grounding pre-trained generation in retrieved external knowledge.\n The benefits of RAG make it a powerful technique for creating AI systems that are more accurate, reliable, and versatile, with broad applications across domains, industries and tasks.\n Developers use RAG to build AI systems that can generate content grounded in accurate information, leading to more reliable, context-aware, and user-centric applications.\n RAG systems combine retrieval and generation, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, industries, and use cases. [...] Interactive and adaptive learning: Through user-centric adaptation, RAG systems can learn from user interactions, retrieving more relevant information over time and adapting their responses to better meet user needs, improving user experience and engagement.\n Versatility and multi-modal integration: RAG can be extended to work with multi-modal data (text, images, structured data), enhancing the richness and diversity of the information used in generation and broadening the applications of the model.\n Informed writing for efficient content creation: RAG provides a powerful tool by retrieving relevant facts and references, ensuring that generated content is not only creative but also accurate and well-informed."

LLMs are debuting on Windows PCs, thanks to NVIDIA software that enables all sorts of applications users can access even on their laptops.\n\nChart shows running RAG on a PC\n\nPCs equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs can now run some AI models locally. By using RAG on a PC, users can link to a private knowledge source – whether that be emails, notes or articles – to improve responses. The user can then feel confident that their data source, prompts and response all remain private and secure. [...] This blog provides an example of RAG accelerated by TensorRT-LLM for Windows to get better results fast.\n\n## The History of RAG\n\nThe roots of the technique go back at least to the early 1970s. That’s when researchers in information retrieval prototyped what they called question-answering systems, apps that use natural language processing (NLP) to access text, initially in narrow topics such as baseball.\n\nThe concepts behind this kind of text mining have remained fairly constant over the years. But the machine learning engines driving them have grown significantly, increasing their usefulness and popularity."

It takes the best of both worlds combining advanced language models with real-time external data and creates something that actually works in business.\n\nTraditional AI is stuck with its training data. RAG flips this by creating a hybrid system that actively searches for and retrieves relevant information from your company's documents, databases, and external sources. The result? Answers grounded in reality, fewer AI \"hallucinations,\" and systems that handle real scenarios."

Off-the-shelf LLMs, known as foundational LLMs, are trained to respond to a broad range of topics. However, they often need to be customized to an organization’s data before they can produce business-specific results. RAG allows organizations to inject their own data into LLMs without retraining or fine-tuning, lowering the barrier of entry to domain-specific, tangible use cases. [...] RAG, an increasingly popular AI framework, helps LLMs deliver more-accurate and -relevant AI responses. RAG supplements an LLM with data from an external knowledge base, ensuring LLMs can access the most-reliable and -current information. This additional data helps LLMs deliver up-to-date and contextually meaningful responses."
