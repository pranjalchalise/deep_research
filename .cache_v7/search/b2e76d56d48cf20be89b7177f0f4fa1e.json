Her story is one of continuous learning and service, and of finding profound meaning in small, human acts of compassion. Along the way, she shares lessons she’s passed on to her two grown sons, both out in the world now, and the two bits of terrific life advice they're most likely to say they hear from their mom. Episode Highlights: How Deb’s winding path from finance to French literature to nursing reflects a life lived with intention. The subtle art of listening, and how she uses it to discern both what people say and what they can’t quite express. What she’s learned about compassion from her students, her patients, and her own aging parents. The role Amherst played in teaching her to read closely, not only books, but people.

      "snippet": "Its power to coordinate specific, vivid images provides index with the means to suggest novel propositions, assertions, and arguments. Peirce memorializes this relational role by charac­ terizing index as Pheme, and as Dicisign (1904: 8.334-9; 1906: MS295: 26; 1908: EP2:489-90). Ultimately, index integrates the logical with the phenomenological and the empirical with the semiotic – when it deploys relational operators to trace event templates and to predict partici­ pant’s perspectives. As such, interpreters restructure thought and action and recommend sound courses of action for diverse event participants. 1.

West State University of New York at Cortland, USA westsimon@twcny.rr.com Abstract This inquiry capitalizes on the relational character of Peirce’s index. Its evolution from object finder in the physical world, to enhancer of communication between minds, to modal/perspecti­ val coordinator is examined. Its relational character organizes events into episodes, and obviates perspectival alterations in dialogic reasoning. This shift demonstrates Peirce’s last word regard­ ing Index: a sign intrinsically dialogic, whose interpretants increase levels of consciousness, and advance communicational interaction by commanding self/others to believe/act in novel ways. Its power to coordinate specific, vivid images provides"
