[...] Abstract: In this paper, we present two systolic array algorithms for efﬁcient Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) implementations of the 1-D Modiﬁed Discrete Sine Transform (MDST) using the systolic array architectural paradigm. The new algorithms decompose the computation of the MDST into modular and regular computational structures called pseudo-circular correlation and pseudo-cycle convolution. The two computational structures for pseudo-circular correlation and pseudo-cycle convolution both have the same form. This feature can be exploited to signiﬁcantly reduce the hardware complexity since the two computational structures can be computed on the same linear systolic array. Moreover, the second algorithm can be used to further reduce the hardware complexity by replacing the general"
