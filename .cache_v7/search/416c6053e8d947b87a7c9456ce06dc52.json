Over the years, many possible solutions have been tried, including pushes on the cervical transverse processes, elevation of one shoulder, and finally something called \"Cheneauisation\", that is an inclination of the entire brace above the apical vertebra of the thoracic curve opposite to the proximal slope, together with an advancement of the shoulder on the same side (Figure 12). The term Cheneauisation was used to underline the fact that it derives from the contamination of our own brace with one of the other most well-known braces at the international level, the Cheneau brace.

CAD-CAM technologies usually allow us to obtain the best results, without using pre-built forms stored in databases, as is often done by others. Orthotists must directly shape the scanned trunk according to the patient's requirements. Once done, a final test must be made on the patient so as to change the first theoretical project and adapt it in the best possible way, depending on the real interaction between the body and the brace."

      "snippet": "directional and never from the human nature to the divine nature. [...] Further reflection:\n\nChristians embrace the incarnation of the divine Son as a union of two distinct natures in one hypostasis. Yet given a doctrine of peccability, is it further supposed that the human nature could possibly have sinned apart from the Person having sinned? In other words, by sinning would the Second Person (God) have committed sin only in his humanity but not personally? It’s hard to tell whether people like Sproul think that the whole person of Christ could possibly sin in his humanity. After all, Sproul’s position entails an unorthodox abstraction that entails things like “Satan was not trying to get God to sin. He was trying to get the human nature of Christ to sin, so that he would not be qualified to be the Savior.”\n\nWrapping up: [...] we may then further deduce that a phase that is both solid and gaseous is more broadly logically (or metaphysically) impossible. Furthermore, a solid-gas is just as relevantly impossible as a solid that is not a solid!"

      "snippet": "But back to Sproul. I’ll make a bold claim: Sproul is preaching heresy when He says God can't even stand to look at humans because they're sinful. Sproul is clearly misrepresenting the character of God.\n\nAfter all, God Himself came to earth as a man to live with, be with, minister to, and save humans. He certainly looked at humans.\n\n> \"Jesus looked at him, loved him...\".\n>\n> \"... when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.”\n\nJesus is God. Hence, Sproul is in error when He claims that God cannot even stand to look at us. Jesus looked at us. He spent time with us. He cared for us. He loved us. Even when we were the worst of sinners. [...] > “For God shows no partiality.”\n\nIs God’s love for the humans He created marked by injustice? Sproul’s website shows us that Sproul advocates for the “Penal Substitution” model of atonement:\n\n> “In penal substitution, the penalty that is due to us for our transgression is paid by a substitute, namely, Jesus Christ… In other words, Christ endured the punishment His people deserve in their place. If we trust in Him alone for salvation, we need not fear eternal death, for Jesus bore our sin on the cross so that we will not receive everlasting judgment (v. 10; John 3:16).”\n\nPenal Substitution\n\nAlso on Sproul’s website, famous pastor and author John MacArthur notes the connection to “justice” in the Penal Substitution model of atonement: [...] Third, Sproul claims on the one hand that:\n\n> “… essential properties are those that are part of the essence of a thing…”.\n\nAnd on the other hand that:\n\n> “… sin is not an external blemish, but something that goes to the very core of our being.”\n\nCome on. If something goes to the very core of a thing, then it is an essential property and/or essence of the thing.\n\n“Core” and “Essence” are, in fact, synonyms.\n\n> “Core is a synonym for essence in heart topic. You can use \"Core\" instead [of]\"Essence\", if it concerns topics such as principle, position, quintessence, basic nature.”\n\nSproul is spouting nonsense. If sin goes to the very core of our being, then sin is, in fact, part of the essence of our being. I don’t believe that is taught in scripture."

These revelations of God all take place at various crisis points in the lives of God’s people. Both Isaiah and Moses were about to be sent on a great mission to proclaim the greatness of the Lord to hardened people. What did they need most at a time like that? Not a promise of success—indeed, Isaiah was told that his message would harden hearts (Isa. 6:8-13). No, what they needed was an understanding of the Lord’s character. When God wanted to give them assurance, He gave them Himself. The same was true of Abraham and Hosea. Humanly speaking, Abraham had little evidence to believe that God would give him many descendants. So, the Lord assured the patriarch of His faithfulness by committing Himself to His own [...] R.C. Sproul\nThe Reformed Doctrine of God by R.C. Sproul\n\nOver the years, I’ve had opportunities to teach systematic theology in a variety of settings, from seminary classrooms to university courses to Sunday school classes in the local church. But no matter where I’ve taught systematics, the first place I typically start is the doctrine of God. Theology, of course, studies God and His character and ways, so it’s appropriate to begin with a look at His nature and attributes before examining what the Bible has to say about redemption, the church, the last things, and the other categories of systematic theology."

Some in the Spiritual Warfare Network now also emphasize the im-portance of dealing with the corporate sin of a geographic territory, see-ing sin as having provided the opening for a territorial spirit to establish a stronghold. In this way dimensions of the truth-encounter approach are incorporated into SLSW. John Dawson, a member of the SWN and author of Taking Our Cities for God (1989) coined the phrase identificational repentance to describe this process of identifying and dealing with territorial sin. Once preparations such as these are in place, a power-encounter takes place by attacking territorial spirits, commanding that their power [...] to inner healing, which maintains how we need to recognize the spiritual roots of our emotional wounds in order to receive deep and lasting healing. Brad Long defines inner healing as “part of the process of undoing the hurtful effects of sin. This includes the results of our own sin and being sinned against. It is a process of restoring to wholeness the shattered image of God within us. As the wounding of sin is overcome, we increasingly reflect the character of Jesus Christ. This is the process of sanctification, which comes from the work of the Holy Spirit within us (2 Corinthians 3:17-18)” (Long, In the Spirit’s Power, p. 110). Michael Evans, like Long, especially emphasizes inner healing in teaching materials. Evans, in his course Learning to Do What Jesus Did, defines inner healing [...] out with discipleship on a renewed path and way of living in freedom. The process of inner heal-ing is marked by such common biblical practices as prayer, repentance, and forgiveness. It also engages in what may be seen as the more extraor-dinary gifts of “words of knowledge” received as thoughts and mental visual images."
