      "snippet": "Claudiu T. Supuran is professor of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of Florence, Italy, since 1995. He did his Ph D at University of Bucharest, Romania, and was a visiting scholar at University of Florida, Gainesville, USA, and at Grifitth University, Brisbane, Australia. He was visiting professor at University of La Plata, Argentina and at University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. His main research interest is the medicinal chemistry/biochemistry of carbonic anhydrases, field in which he has made contributions to the design of many novel classes of enzyme inhibitors and activators, deciphering their mechanism of action at molecular level, discovery of new isoforms and their role in disease (cancer, obesity, epilepsy, neuropathic pain and cognition), [...] obesity, epilepsy, neuropathic pain and cognition), discovery and characterization of carbonic anhydrases from various organisms (bacteria, fungi, corals, vertebrates other than humans and rodents, etc). Other research interests include X-ray crystallography of metallo-enzymes, heterocyclic chemistry, chemistry of sulfonamides, metal-based drugs, cyclooxygenases, serine proteases, matrix metalloproteinases, bacterial proteases, and amino acid derivatives among others. He has published more than 1500 papers in these fields and his Hirsch index is 134. One of the compounds discovered in his laboratory (SLC-0111) is in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of advanced metastatic solid tumors.

      "snippet": "One of the earliest official interactions between Jesuits and astronomy came in 1582, when mathematician Christopher Clavius, S.J., used calculations by scientists — including Copernicus and Erasmus Reinhold — in his creation of the Gregorian calendar, which accounted more closely for the length of the Earth’s trip around the sun and changed the timing of leap days to correct the 365-day calendar. Fr. Clavius, who taught at the Roman College, was in frequent correspondence with the astronomer Galileo Galilei, who often consulted with the Jesuit priest on mathematical issues of the day.\n\n11\n\nAsteroids have been named after Jesuits [...] 11\n\nAsteroids have been named after Jesuits\n\nRobert Bellarmine, S.J. — after whom the University’s Bellarmine Hall is named — would challenge Galileo to prove some of his findings, sparking a struggle between Galileo and Pope Urban VIII (a non-Jesuit) that brought the scientist before the Roman Inquisition more than once. Meanwhile, the Jesuits continued to make important contributions to astronomy. Giovanni Battista Riccioli, S.J., conducted some of the most thorough research of the late 17th century to demonstrate the Earth’s rotation around its axis — research that wasn’t fully realized for another 200 years. Roger Boscovich, S.J., who studied the travel of comets and the transit of Venus across the sun, helped prove the heliocentric model that Galileo had promoted. [...] ## Did You Know?\n\nSaint Joseph’s may have dipped its toes into the medicinal trade early in its history. A company called “The College Remedy Company” had the same address as the University’s one-time location on North 12th Street. The company sold elixirs and tonics claiming medical benefits, including “Father Villiger’s Remedy,” trading on the well-known name and image of Burchard Villiger, Saint Joseph’s fifth president.\n\nThe Jesuit, Scientist Pope"
