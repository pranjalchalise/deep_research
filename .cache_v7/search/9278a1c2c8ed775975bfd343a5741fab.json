      "snippet": "In accounting, amortization is a method of obtaining the expenses incurred by an intangible asset arising from a decline in value as a result of use or the passage of time. Amortization is the acquisition cost minus the residual value of an asset, calculated in a systematic manner over an asset's useful economic life. Depreciation is a corresponding concept for tangible assets.\n\nMethodologies for allocating amortization to each accounting period are generally the same as those for depreciation. However, many intangible assets such as goodwill \"Goodwill (accounting)\") or certain brands may be deemed to have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not subject to amortization (although goodwill is subjected to an impairment test every year). [...] While theoretically amortization is used to account for the decreasing value of an intangible asset over its useful life, in practice many companies will amortize what would otherwise be one-time expenses through listing them as a capital expense on the cash flow statement and paying off the cost through amortization, having the effect of improving the company's net income in the fiscal year or quarter of the expense.\n\nAmortization is recorded in the financial statements of an entity as a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset in the balance sheet and as an expense in the income statement.

      "snippet": "What is amortization in simple terms?\n\nAmortization is the gradual expense of an intangible asset’s cost over its useful life. It\nspreads the asset’s value over periods that benefit from it in accordance with the matching\nprinciple, which requires expenses to be recognized in the same period as the revenue they\nhelped to generate instead of when they’re paid.\n\nIs amortization a liability or an expense?\n\nAmortization is a non-cash expense. It reduces the book value of an intangible asset over\ntime in line with the matching principle, but it doesn’t create a liability.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of amortization? [...] ## What Is Amortization?\n\nAmortization is the accounting process of systematically allocating the cost of an intangible\nasset over the duration of its useful life. It’s similar in concept to depreciation, which\nis used for fixed tangible assets like machinery, but amortization is applied to intangible\nassets, such as copyrights, patents, and customer lists.\n\nThe term “loan amortization” is also used to describe how loan repayments are divided between\ninterest charges and the reduction of outstanding principal, although that’s a completely\ndifferent financial process. This article focuses on amortization as it relates to\naccounting and expense management in business. Under US Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (GAAP), this is guided primarily by ASC 350-30.\n\nKey Takeaways [...] ## How Is Amortization Calculated?\n\nFor book purposes, companies generally calculate amortization using the straight-line method.\nThis method spreads the cost of the intangible asset evenly over all the accounting periods\nthat will benefit from it.\n\nThe formula for amortization is:\n\nAnnual Amortization =\nCapitalized cost / Estimated useful life\n\nDetermining the capitalized\ncost of an intangible asset (the numerator in this equation) can be the\ntrickiest part of the calculation. Say a company purchases an intangible asset, such as a\npatent for a new type of solar panel. The capitalized cost is the fair market value, based\non what the company paid in cash, stock, or other consideration, plus other incidental costs\nincurred to acquire the intangible asset, such as legal fees."

      "snippet": "Amortizing Startup Costs\n\nIn the U.S., business startup costs, defined as costs incurred to investigate the potential of creating or acquiring an active business and costs to create an active business, can only be amortized under certain conditions. They must be expenses that are deducted as business expenses if incurred by an existing active business and must be incurred before the active business begins. Examples of these costs include consulting fees, financial analysis of potential acquisitions, advertising expenditures, and payments to employees, all of which must be incurred before the business is deemed active. According to IRS guidelines, initial startup costs must be amortized.\n\nFinancial Calculators [...] Amortization as a way of spreading business costs in accounting generally refers to intangible assets like a patent or copyright. Under Section 197 of U.S. law, the value of these assets can be deducted month-to-month or year-to-year. Just like with any other amortization, payment schedules can be forecasted by a calculated amortization schedule. The following are intangible assets that are often amortized: [...] ### Spreading Costs\n\nCertain businesses sometimes purchase expensive items that are used for long periods of time that are classified as investments. Items that are commonly amortized for the purpose of spreading costs include machinery, buildings, and equipment. From an accounting perspective, a sudden purchase of an expensive factory during a quarterly period can skew the financials, so its value is amortized over the expected life of the factory instead. Although it can technically be considered amortizing, this is usually referred to as the depreciation expense of an asset amortized over its expected lifetime.

      "snippet": "Example A: A business has a $10,000 software license, which it expects will come to an end in five years. Using the straight-line method, the amortization expense would be $2,000 per year for the next five years. At the end of five years, the carrying amount of the asset will be zero. The amortization period is the amount of time in which the company expects to generate revenue from the license.\n\n### Is amortization a liability or expense?\n\nAmortization is a non-cash expense. It is the concept of incrementally charging the cost (i.e., the expenditure required to acquire the asset) of an asset to expense over the asset’s useful life.\n\nSo how does this look? It reflects as a debit to the amortization expense account and a credit to the accumulated amortization account. [...] Depending on the type of asset — tangible versus intangible — there are differences in the calculation method allowed and how they are presented on financial statements. Understanding these differences is critical when serving business clients.\n\nJump to ↓\n\n|  |\n\n| What is amortization in accounting? |\n\n|  |\n\n| What are the different amortization methods? |\n\n|  |\n\n| How to calculate amortization |\n\n|  |\n\n| Amortization vs. depreciation |\n\n|  |\n\n| Managing amortization of assets |\n\n## What is amortization in accounting?\n\nAmortization in accounting is a technique that is used to gradually write-down the cost of an intangible asset over its expected period of use or, in other words, useful life. This shifts the asset to the income statement from the balance sheet. [...] 1. Determine the initial cost of the asset.\n2. Determine the number of periods. For instance, for trademarks and patents the number of years until they expire is typically used to calculate amortization.\n3. Determine the salvage value.\n4. Calculate the straight-line amortization rate.\n\nConsider the following example of a company looking to sell rights to its intellectual property.\n\nCompany A purchases intellectual property for $20,000. It plans to sell the rights to Company B after five years for $4,000. Company A then uses the straight-line amortization formula to determine its amortization expense: \n\nAmortization per year = ($20,000 – $4,000) / 5 \n\nAmortization per year = $3,200\n\n### #2.

      "snippet": "We can easily work out the amortization of the television along its 10-year useful life. One of the most common calculations is annual amortization, where we divide the initial cost of the asset by its estimated useful life (EUR 1,000/10 years). The outcome is EUR 100 per year. In the first year, it’ll have amortized EUR 100; in the second, EUR 200; and in the third, EUR 300, and so on until we reach the amount we paid. If the television continues to work after the end of its useful life, it will take on a residual value.\n\nWhat is amortization of a loan? [...] What is amortization of a loan?\n\nLoans can include consumer credit, a bank loan and a mortgage. Amortization in this case is the gradual reduction of the debt through the repayments we agree with the lender. Broadly speaking, loan amortization only considers the principal and doesn’t include interest.\n\nThese are the most common ways to calculate loan amortization: [...] When we buy and sell items on collaborative economy apps, we can find out the real value of those items thanks to annual amortization, which considers the original cost and the time they’ve been in use. It’s also handy to calculate the amortization of technology devices so we know when they’ll need replacing. That way, we can set aside a sum in our budget to avoid a sudden blow to our wallet.\n\nWhen we need a loan to buy an asset, it helps to know the amortization schedule to avoid taking on debt for something that could lose its value before we fully settle the borrowed amount.\n\nFinancing: A good or bad move?\n\nFinancial Education\n\nFinancial Inclusion\n\nYou might like\n\nFIND OUT MORE"
