      "snippet": "This study aims to genomically elucidate six isolates of rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria (RGM) derived from Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens). These isolates had previously undergone phenotypic and biochemical characterization, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and in vivo virulence assessment. Initial DNA barcoding using the 16S rRNA sequence assigned these six isolates to five different species, namely Mycobacterium chelonae (BN1983), M. cosmeticum (BN1984 and N041), M. farcinogenes (SNSK5), M. mucogenicum (BN1956), and M. senegalense (BN1985). However, the identification relied solely on the highest percent identity of the 16S rRNA gene, raising concerns about the taxonomic ambiguity of these species. Comprehensive whole genome sequencing (WGS) and extended genomic [...] GroEL (groel), and capsule (rmlb) from distantly related environmental bacteria such as Klebsiella sp., Neisseria sp., Clostridium sp., and Streptococcus sp. This study provides the first draft genome sequence of RGM isolates currently circulating in B. splendens and underscores the necessity of WGS for the identification and classification of mycobacterial species.
