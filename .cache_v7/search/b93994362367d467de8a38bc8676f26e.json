He won\nhis second consulship in 104 B.C., and shortly afterward achieved great renown\nfor defeating the Teutone and Cimbri invaders in northern Italy.\nThese victories brought him great\npopularity with both the people of Rome, and the army, and he was elected consul five years in\nsuccession, from 104 to 100 B.C., an unprecedented run. During this period he\nreorganized the army, an achievement that laid the ground work for the Roman legions of imperial\ndays. Under Marius, Rome established for the first time a standing army, manned by professional\nsoldiers. During this period Marius achieved great things for Rome, enjoyed immense popularity, and\nwas called the \"Third Founder of Rome.\" [...] # Marius\n\n## (Caius Marius)\n\n|  |\n\n| Marius |\n| MARIUS SITTING IN EXILE AMOUNG THE RUINS OF CARTHAGE |\n\nMarius was from a family of humble origin, but he distinguished himself as a great soldier and rose\nto the highest ranks of government.

      "snippet": "After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate [...] ## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarius was an extremely successful Roman general and politician. In ancient sources, he has been repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism. Plutarch says of him:\n\n> if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age. [...] Gaius Marius (Latin: (/wiki/Help:IPA/Latin \"Help:IPA/Latin\"); c. 157 BC – 13 January 86 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times. Rising from a family of smallholders in a village called Ceraetae in the district of Arpinum, Marius acquired his initial military experience serving with Scipio Aemilianus at the Siege of Numantia in 134 BC. He won election as tribune of the plebs in 119 BC and passed a law limiting aristocratic interference in elections. Barely elected praetor in 115 BC, he next became the governor of Further Spain where he campaigned against bandits."

      "snippet": "gaius marius bust glyptothek\n\nMarius’s military reputation, along with actions such as eating meals alongside the troops and sharing in their labors, won him significant support among the soldiers. He also won support among Italian traders in the area by suggesting he could end the war in a few days with half of Metellus’s troops. Both groups wrote home recommending Marius.\n\nWith his growing support, Marius wanted to run for consul in 108 BCE, but Metellus did not support him or give him leave to return to Rome to contest the election. Nevertheless, Marius was determined, according to Sallust, partly due to a positive prediction from a fortune-teller; the Romans placed great stock in the predictions of soothsayers and astrologers. [...] Gaius Marius is one of the most compelling personalities of the Roman Republic. Entering politics as a “novus homo” from Italy with few political connections, he proved both his military skill and unbridled ambition during the Jugurthine War. He was subsequently elected consul an incredible seven times as he was seen as the only general capable of dealing with the Cimbrian threat.\n\nServing into his late 50s, Marius initially looked like he would retire as a respected statesman, but fate and ambition involved him in a civil war that left the general dead and Sulla as dictator in Rome. This is the story of Rome’s first strongman, who broke precedents and created a personal army, paving the way for future strongmen, like his nephew Julius Caesar.\n\n## Gaius Marius: Novus Homo [...] Marius understood that he would need fresh troops to end the war in Numidia quickly. Rome’s traditional recruits, landowning citizens, were overextended, so Marius obtained permission to recruit discharged veterans and men without property to fight in exchange for loot. Some modern scholars suggest that this led to a change in Roman military recruitment, but the evidence suggests this happened a few decades later. Nevertheless, Marius’s innovation set a precedent. He left for Africa with new cavalry, and his new infantry sailed behind him with his quaestor Lucius Cornelius Sulla.\n\njugurtha bound cimbrian war"

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] Role In:\n:   Social War\n\nSee all related content\n\nMarius had always had equestrian support, not only because his origins lay in that class but also because wars were bad for trade, and Marius had brought serious wars to an end. The Roman populace liked him because he was not an aristocrat. He had the further support of his veterans, for it was in their interest to stick closely to their general. Marius perhaps did not realize the potency of their force, one that Sulla, Caesar, and Octavian employed with overpowering effect later.\n\nAccess for the whole family!\n\nBundle Britannica Premium and Kids for the ultimate resource destination."

Having defeated the Germans, Marius was hailed as Rome’s savior. Upon returning to Rome, he was again elected as consul for the sixth time.

Shehadi\n\nHe was one of the most important figures in all of ancient Roman history, rivaling even Julius Caesar or Cicero. [...] Share\n\nMarius’ electioneering was successful. Earning the acclaim of Rome’s populace, he was awarded military command by the tribunes. This marked a turning point in Roman politics because, for the first time, the popular assembly was getting directly involved in foreign policy. The populism of Marius was an outrage to Rome’s aristocrats, who tried to blunt his meteoric rise to power. The Senate even refused to supply him with troops. To circumvent the elites, General Marius began to recruit ordinary Roman citizens as his soldiers. Now, anyone could serve in Rome’s armed forces, regardless of their personal wealth or nobility. Under Marius, Roman troops were no longer dependent on the aristocratic Senate. Instead, soldiers relied on the personal patronage of their military commanders."
