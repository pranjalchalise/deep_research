      "snippet": "Robert Charles Sproul (/sproʊl/ SPROHL; February 13, 1939 – December 14, 2017) was an American Reformed theologian, Christian apologist, and ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America. He was the founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, and could be heard daily on the Renewing Your Mind radio broadcast internationally. [...] Sproul was a critic of postmodern philosophy. He considered postmodern thinking as a seduction to the church. This seduction originated towards the end of the cultural revolution of the 1960s and produced \"the most narcissistic generation in the history of the human race.\" Sproul saw churches responding to that cultural change by \"adopting the use of sound bites, entertainment, and that sort of thing\" in replacement of using biblical teaching directly. Further, he found that this infiltration of postmodernity led to a \"revival of ancient Gnosticism\" with a \"wide spread rejection of rationality\" within the Christian church. He believed that many churches, as a result of this rejection, now teach that \"biblical revelation is only intelligible by intuition or by a particularly sensitive [...] Sproul was an advocate of Reformed theology in his many print, audio, and video publications, and advocated the Thomistic (classical) approaches to Christian apologetics, less common among Reformed apologists, most of whom prefer presuppositionalism.[citation needed] A dominant theme in his Renewing Your Mind lessons is the holiness and sovereignty of God. Sproul taught that headcovering should be practiced in churches as the ordinance is \"rooted and grounded in creation\"."

Today we're releasing our first ambient agent of the week - an executive AI email assistant. This agent is built on top of a pattern we believe will be widely adopted throughout the agents released this year, and in years to come. Ambient agents are AI applications which can suggest actions to the user, then await your approval, feedback, or edits before executing the action. This pattern enables whole hosts of agent applications which would not have been fully trusted by users before, like an email assistant.

I don’t know by what means I will die. It may be via a process of suffering, and that frightens me.\n\nI know that even this shouldn’t frighten me. There are lots of things that frighten me that I shouldn’t let frighten me. The Scripture declares that perfect love casts out fear. But love is still imperfect, and fear hangs around.\n\nHe wrote about what it would be like to be in heaven and identified with Christ: [...] Those two books, I think, first of all point out the transcendent majesty of God, and second, the sovereignty of God.\n\nThose two ideas so inform our whole understanding of God, of Christ, of ourselves, and of the whole gamut of Christian thought that it is the foundational material that I use to introduce people to these things. [...] You can grieve for me the week before I die, if I’m scared and hurting, but when I gasp that last fleeting breath and my immortal soul flees to heaven, I’m going to be jumping over fire hydrants down the golden streets, and my biggest concern, if I have any, will be my wife back here grieving.\n\nWhen I die, I will be identified with Christ’s exaltation. But right now, I’m identified with His affliction.\n\nAnd in an article entitled “Death Does Not Have the Last Word,” he wrote:\n\nWhen we close our eyes in death, we do not cease to be alive; rather, we experience a continuation of personal consciousness.\n\nNo person is more conscious, more aware, and more alert than when he passes through the veil from this world into the next."
