      "snippet": "When discussing takeaways to Sam’s you have to talk about the osmosis he created by putting himself in the right rooms and at the right times. If you have the ambition to change the world, you sure as hell better be grabbing coffee and walking your dog with those who are doing the same.   \n  \nThe playbook Sam runs by getting in front of the right people is something we can all take inspiration from. [...] Altman is a doomsday prepper: “I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.”\n Sam was also the CEO of Reddit for eight days (yes, 1 day more than a week) in 2014 after CEO Yishan Wong resigned.\n He is also gay. In prep school, Sam addressed the whole community, announcing that he was gay and asking whether the school wanted to be a repressive place or one open to different ideas.   \n  “What Sam did changed the school. It felt like someone had opened up a great big box full of all kinds of kids and let them out into the world.”\n In his personal life, Sam is married and has two children. He is an avid tennis player and enjoys spending time with his family. [...] There’s absolutely no reason to believe that in about thirteen years we won’t have hardware capable of replicating my brain. Yes, certain things still feel particularly human—creativity, flashes of inspiration from nowhere, the ability to feel happy and sad at the same time—but computers will have their own desires and goal systems.\n\nWhen I realised that intelligence can be simulated, I let the idea of our uniqueness go, and it wasn’t as traumatic as I thought.\n\n- Sam Altman\n\n# Playbook\n\nHere, I’d like to detail what I think makes Sama great, why he outperforms and why most would bet on him to play a massive part in the future of technology and humanity as a whole."

The chief executive of the company behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot has warned companies against aggressive hiring after making AI-driven layoffs. He has advised companies to take a more cautious approach to workforce expansion as AI capabilities continue to advance.In a recently live-streamed town hall event (seen by Business Insider), Altman said, “What I think we shouldn't do, and what I hope other companies won't do either, is hire super aggressively, then realise all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation. So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.”"
