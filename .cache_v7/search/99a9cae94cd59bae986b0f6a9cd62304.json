      "snippet": "## Related Work and the Bigger Picture\n\nThere’s growing work around using agents to analyze peer review itself, generate collaborative reviewer discussions, and measure overlap between AI and human feedback. Liang et al. showed GPT-4 feedback overlaps significantly with humans but misses novelty critique more often. Other evaluations also found LLMs over-index on technical validity while neglecting true originality.\n\nMore recent ICLR studies even explored using LLM feedback to improve human review quality itself, acting almost as a critique-of-critique layer.\n\nAnd beyond review tools, this connects to a much wider push:\n\n> AI agents generating hypotheses.  \n>  Running entire experimental loops.  \n>  Automated end-to-end discovery systems. [...] Now the review isn’t generic “LLM vibes” anymore. It is grounded in what’s actually been published recently rather than what the base model half-remembers from training data.\n\n### Step 3: Structured Review Generation\n\nFinally, the agent synthesizes:\n\n> The Markdown of your paper\n>\n> The summaries of related work\n\nAnd generates a full review using a consistent template. This is where feedback becomes useful rather than decorative.\n\nInstead of shallow praise and nitpicks, the output aims for things like:\n\n Are claims supported by experiments?\n Which baselines are missing or outdated based on very recent arXiv work?\n Where novelty seems weak relative to adjacent papers?\n Where clarity breaks down technically?

We waited. And waited. And waited some more. Six months later, three anonymous paragraphs landed in the inbox. One reviewer was annoyed about missing baselines we did include, another wanted more experiments but didn’t say which ones mattered, and the third basically summarized our own abstract back at us. Not feedback. Judgment vibes. We fixed whatever we could guess and re-submitted into the same black hole.\n\n## Generative AI books"

      "snippet": "analysis. The findings also suggest an opportunity to explore emerging methodologies such as topic modeling and meta-analysis. We dissect the state of the art presented in these reviews, finding themes throughout the broad scholarly discourse through thematic clustering and BERTopic modeling. Categorization of study articles across fields of research indicates dominance in Information and Computing Sciences, followed by Biomedical and Clinical Sciences. Subject categories reveal interconnected clusters across various sectors, notably in healthcare, engineering, business intelligence, and computational technologies. Semantic analysis via BERTopic revealed nineteen clusters mapped to themes such as AI in health innovations, AI for sustainable development, AI and deep learning, AI in [...] In a world that has rapidly transformed through the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), our systematic review, guided by the PRISMA protocol, investigates a decade of AI research, revealing insights into its evolution and impact. Our study, examining 3,767 articles, has drawn considerable attention, as evidenced by an impressive 63,577 citations, underscoring the scholarly community's profound engagement. Our study reveals a collaborative landscape with 18,189 contributing authors, reflecting a robust network of researchers advancing AI and machine learning applications. Review categories focus on systematic reviews and bibliometric analyses, indicating an increasing emphasis on comprehensive literature synthesis and quantitative analysis. The findings also suggest an opportunity to [...] AI for sustainable development, AI and deep learning, AI in education, and ethical considerations.

      "snippet": "school and university levels. Findings reveal a range of preconceptions, misconceptions, and myths about AI, such as: Learners often have limited understanding of AI on a technical level. They tend to attribute human-like characteristics or attributes to AI systems and may have narrow views of AI's scope, capabilities, and limitations. The review also shows that learners often have binary and unspecific views about the threats, dangers, and benefits of AI. Effective educational programs are key to empower learners' understanding of AI, thus helping them make informed decisions about the integration of AI in our society, rather than being swayed by misinformation and unnecessary fear. This review may help inform the development of more effective teaching and outreach strategies in AI [...] Artificial Intelligence (AI) is prevalent in nearly every aspect of our lives. However, recent studies have found a significant amount of confusion and misunderstanding surrounding AI. To develop effective educational programs in the field of AI, it is vital to examine and understand learners' pre- and misconceptions as well as myths about AI. This study examined a corpus of 591 studies. 25 relevant studies were identified by applying the following eligibility criteria: English-written original empirical research on education and AI and reporting AI conceptions in a formal learning context. The review found studies from six continents, with the majority conducted in Europe and North America. The studies predominantly focus on the school and university levels. Findings reveal a range of [...] of more effective teaching and outreach strategies in AI education."

Even with a general generative AI platform like Copilot, you can use AI to help you brainstorm or discover new perspectives on research topics. An example prompt for this purpose can be found in David Maslach's article, \"Generative AI Can Supercharge Your Academic Research,\" “I am thinking about [insert topic], but this is not a very novel idea. Can you help me find innovative papers and research from the last 10 years that has discussed [insert topic]?” [...] Be sure to keep track of what tools you use, your purpose for using them, and the output from your interactions. Be prepared to disclose the AI tools, databases, and criteria used to select and analyze sources. Remember you are the one ultimately responsible for anything you create, generative AI is only your assistant.\n\nTry these five AI platforms to assist you in your literature reviews and academic research: [...] The University of Iowa\n\n# Office of Teaching, Learning, and Technology\n\n## Breadcrumb\n\n1. Home\n2. News\n\n# AI-Assisted Literature Reviews\n\nTuesday, March 5, 2024\n\nChatGPT has a reputation for generating hallucinations, or false information. So can an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform be trusted to assist in a literature review? Yes, if the tool you are using is the right one for the job. ChatGPT and Copilot are not designed to provide accurate citations. Instead, use them to brainstorm research questions. Keep alert for misinformation, hallucinations, and bias that could be part of the generative AI’s responses."

      "snippet": "•   Mandatory governance regimes for AI, even those to stave off catastrophic risks, will face stiff opposition from AI researchers and companies, but voluntary regimes calling for self-governance are more likely to gain support.\n\n#### Overview\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of computers to perform functions associated with the human brain, including perceiving, reasoning, learning, interacting, problem solving, and exercising creativity. AI promises to be a fundamental enabler of technological advancement and progress in many fields, arguably as important as electricity or the internet. In 2024, the Nobel Prizes for Physics and Chemistry were awarded for work intimately related to AI. [...] #### Key Developments\n\nDominating the AI conversation in 2024 were foundation models, which are large-scale systems trained on very large volumes of diverse data. Such training endows them with broad capabilities, and they can apply knowledge learned in one context to a different context, making them more flexible and efficient than traditional task-specific models. [...] Explainability Today’s AI is for the most part incapable of explaining how it arrives at a specific conclusion. Explanations are not always necessary, but in cases such as medical decision-making, they may be critical.\n Bias and fairness Machine learning models are trained on existing datasets, which means that any bias in the data can skew results.\n Vulnerability to spoofing For many AI models, data inputs can be tweaked to fool them into drawing false conclusions.\n Deepfakes AI provides the capability for generating highly realistic but entirely inauthentic audio and video, with concerning implications for courtroom evidence and political deception.\n Overtrust As trust in AI grows, the risk of overlooking errors, mishaps, and unforeseen incidents also increases."
