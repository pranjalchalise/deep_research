See the role here: \n\nDiana Smith\n\nVP of Marketing [...] This is probably the coolest role I have hired for on my team (with maybe the exception of hiring Hana Hassan to lead brand at Twilioorg). We are looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join the marketing team at LangChain! This person will get to build the future of marketing, on top of LangChain frameworks and products. You'll be a top internal customer and influence the product roadmap. Together, we will figure out what needs to be different if we embrace AI in marketing from the early innings of building a team. We're hiring for this role because we know we can't just repeat the SaaS marketing playbook and be successful today. We could buy a bunch of AI-native GTM tools. And maybe we will at some point.

      "snippet": "Gerstner convinced Sproul to study under G. C. Berkouwer at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Free University of Amsterdam) in Holland, where he initiated study in 1964. Sproul was granted leave in 1965 due to his wife's second pregnancy and mother's illness (during which he was appointed to teach philosophy at Westminster College \"Westminster College (Pennsylvania)\")), and later resumed study at distance. He returned to Holland in 1969 to receive a doctorandus degree.\n\nHe married Vesta Voorhis in 1960 and had two children, Sherrie Dorotiak and Robert Craig Sproul.\n\nSproul was a passenger on the Amtrak train that derailed in the 1993 Big Bayou Canot train wreck, and sometimes gave firsthand accounts of the story.\n\n## Career\n\n[edit] [...] ## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Sproul's direction, Ligonier Ministries produced the Ligonier Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, which would eventually grow into the 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy. Along with Norman Geisler, Sproul was one of the chief architects of the statement. [...] Robert Charles Sproul (/sproʊl/ SPROHL; February 13, 1939 – December 14, 2017) was an American Reformed theologian, Christian apologist, and ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America. He was the founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries, and could be heard daily on the Renewing Your Mind radio broadcast internationally."
