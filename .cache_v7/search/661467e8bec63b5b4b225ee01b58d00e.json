      "title": "LangChain 1.0 — A second look - Medium",
      "snippet": "LangChain 1.0 is a vast improvement over the 0.3 LangChain frameworks — it is a comprehensive rewrite with many new, meaningful features. LangGraph 1.0 is a modest yet meaningful improvement, deliberately re-designed to fit better with LangChain 1.0.\n\nTo keep this article digestible, I’ll cover only the meaningful improvements (there are many) of the LangChain 1.0 framework. I’ll probably cover the LangGraph 1.0 framework in a separate article.\n\nAs always, all codes can be found in my GitHub repository.\n\n## TLDR: The core changes at a high level\n\nI’ve identified two main core changes:\n\n### Context engineering [...] Before LangChain 1.0, it was common practice to create a single agent with LangGraph’s prebuilt `create_react_agent` and then orchestrate it further with LangGraph — even if you had only one agent.\n\nWhy? Because you’d often need to insert pre-processing or post-validation steps before and after the agent call.\n\nNow you can do all of that within LangChain itself — no LangGraph required. You can even inject custom logic during LLM or tool interactions, giving you fine-grained control without additional orchestration complexity.\n\nIn other words: fewer moving parts, more flexibility.\n\n## ⚙️ Middleware — the New Heart of LangChain\n\nThis is my favorite part of LangChain 1.0. [...] ### Context engineering\n\nLangChain 1.0 has put context engineering front and center of its consideration with the `middleware` abstractions. These abstractions are honestly very fun to use and make it easier for developers to better ensure context quarantine and prevent context pollution — extracting the best performance out of your agents.\n\n### The developer experience:\n\nGoodbye LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) runnables with pipes — I won’t miss you. Apps that have many “|” operators (`prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()`)are no longer a thing — thank goodness. LangChain 1.0 is no longer a low-level framework but a low-mid level framework. This means the learning curve and developer speeds are much better.\n\nOh, and the docs improved as well.\n\n## The LLM"

Minor releases contain new features and improvements but do not include breaking changes.Patch versions are released frequently, up to a few times per week, as they contain bug fixes and minor improvements.\n\n## ​ API stability\n\nThe development of LLM applications is a rapidly evolving field, and we are constantly learning from our users and the community. As such, we expect that the APIs in `langchain` and `langchain-core` will continue to evolve to better serve the needs of our users.With LangChain 1.0’s adoption of semantic versioning:"
