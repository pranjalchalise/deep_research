The Constitution accepts and respects the principle of legality as a part of the overall basic outline of a law-based state. Positive law does not, however, bind it merely to formal legality, rather the interpretation and application of legal norms are subordinated to their content and substantive purpose, law is qualified by respect for the basic values of a democratic society and also measures the application of legal norms by these values. This means that even while there is continuity of “old laws” there is a discontinuity in values from the “old regime”. This conception of the constitutional state rejects the formal-rational legitimacy of a regime and the formal law-based state. Whatever the laws of a state may be, in a state which is [...] contrast to totalitarian systems, which were founded on the basis of the goals of the moment and were never bound by legal principles, particularly principles of constitutional law, a democratic state proceeds on the basis of entirely different values and criteria. Every state, particularly one which was compelled for a period of more than 40 years to suffer the violation of fundamental rights and basic freedoms by a totalitarian regime, has the right to enthrone a democratic order and to apply such legal measures as are calculated to avert the risk of subversion or of a possible relapse into totalitarianism, or at least to limit those risks. As one of the basic concepts and requirements of a law-based state, legal certainty must, therefore, consist in certainty with regard to its"
