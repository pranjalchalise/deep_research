[...] ## 'Dead honest'\n\nMost of the 2,000-odd residents of Kheda have actually never met Mr Kejriwal: he has no friends here and the relatives have few memories of his growing up years. He occasionally visited the village during festivals and weddings.\n\nYet, they are full of praise for the 44-year-old man who has become the most talked about leader in the country.\n\nA former civil servant, Mr Kejriwal was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay award for Emergent Leadership, widely described as Asia's Nobel prize, for social work and initiatives to fight corruption in 2006.\n\nTwo years ago, he set up a group called India Against Corruption aimed at putting pressure on the government to bring about tough anti-corruption laws.\n\nThe rest, as the villagers say, is history.
