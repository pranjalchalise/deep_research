      "snippet": "The collaboration combines the world-renowned fragment-based and structure-based drug design expertise of Stephen W. Fesik, Ph.D., professor of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Chemistry, and Orrin H. Ingram II Chair in Cancer Research, and his laboratory at Vanderbilt University with IACS’ fully-integrated drug development and translational medicine capabilities. [...] MD Anderson News Release 10/24/13\n\nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center’s Institute for Applied Cancer Science (IACS) and Vanderbilt University will combine drug discovery and clinical translation efforts to accelerate the development of novel pharmacological inhibitors, initially focusing on bromodomain family of epigenetic regulators. [...] Fesik takes an unbiased approach to identifying and optimizing novel chemical matter by screening libraries of small molecules called fragments and subsequently combining these fragments with weak affinities that bind to different sites to generate new chemical matter with higher affinity for the protein target. This approach of fragment-based drug design relies on a technique pioneered by Fesik, known as SAR by NMR (structure-activity relationship by nuclear magnetic resonance), which led to the discovery of inhibitors against the previously undruggable Bcl-2 family of proteins."
