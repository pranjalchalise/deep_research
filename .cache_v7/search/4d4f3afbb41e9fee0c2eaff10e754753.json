[...] of negative mental health impacts due to loss of place, community, and livelihoods. The loss of personal identity, autonomy, control, and culture can lead to mental distress, insecurity, diminished self-worth, sadness, anxiety, depression, anger, and weakened social and community cohesion. A warming climate can also lead to aggravated interpersonal aggression (such as domestic violence, assault, and rape) and interpersonal violence (murder). Heightened anxiety and uncertainty likewise negatively impact social relationships and attitudes toward other people. Migration and competition for scarce resources can lead to intergroup hostility, aggression, violence (political conflict, war), and even terrorism. [...] The impacts of a changing climate on mental health stem from both acute events and longer-term change. Climate change-fueled disaster events impact individual mental health and include trauma and shock, PTSD, anxiety and depression that can lead to suicidal ideation and risky behavior, feelings of abandonment, and physical health impacts (such as digestive conditions and weakened immune system). Community-wide impacts include strains on social relationships, reduced social cohesion, interpersonal violence including domestic and child abuse, and increases in stress and PTSD amongst vulnerable populations."

Audiences in Cuba described the event as a “miracle,” and the Argen­ tine author Julio Cortázar later declared that the broadcast marked “the birth of radio,” “the most important moment I experienced in twentieth-­ century history.”2 Cortázar was not alone in his belief. The New York Times worried “that if Firpo were to win, Americans would have to rethink the Mon­ roe Doctrine and its meaning.”3 Late"

Peirce memorializes this relational role by charac­ terizing index as Pheme, and as Dicisign (1904: 8.334-9; 1906: MS295: 26; 1908: EP2:489-90). Ultimately, index integrates the logical with the phenomenological and the empirical with the semiotic – when it deploys relational operators to trace event templates and to predict partici­ pant’s perspectives. As such, interpreters restructure thought and action and recommend sound courses of action for diverse event participants. 1.

West State University of New York at Cortland, USA westsimon@twcny.rr.com Abstract This inquiry capitalizes on the relational character of Peirce’s index. Its evolution from object finder in the physical world, to enhancer of communication between minds, to modal/perspecti­ val coordinator is examined. Its relational character organizes events into episodes, and obviates perspectival alterations in dialogic reasoning. This shift demonstrates Peirce’s last word regard­ ing Index: a sign intrinsically dialogic, whose interpretants increase levels of consciousness, and advance communicational interaction by commanding self/others to believe/act in novel ways.
