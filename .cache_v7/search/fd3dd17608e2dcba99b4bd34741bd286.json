      "snippet": "Besides his history of Augustus' reign that caused him so much grief, his major works included Tyrrhenika, a twenty-book Etruscan history, and Carchedonica, an eight-volume history of Carthage, as well as an Etruscan dictionary. He also wrote a book on dice-playing. Despite the general avoidance of the topic of the Republican era, he penned a defense of Cicero against the charges of Asinius Gallus. Modern historians have used this to determine the nature of his politics and of the aborted chapters of his civil war history. [...] The best known fictional representation of the Emperor Claudius was contained in the books I, Claudius and Claudius the God (published in 1934 and 1935, respectively) by Robert Graves, both written in the first-person to give the reader the impression that they are Claudius's autobiography. Graves employed a fictive artifice to suggest that they were recently discovered, genuine translations of Claudius's writings. Claudius's extant letters, speeches, and sayings were incorporated into the text (mostly in the second book, Claudius the God), to add authenticity. [...] He proposed a reform of the Latin alphabet by the addition of three new letters; he officially instituted the change during his censorship but they did not survive his reign. Claudius also tried to revive the old custom of putting dots between successive words (Classical Latin was written with no spacing). Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography that Suetonius describes as lacking in taste. Claudius (like most of the members of his dynasty) harshly criticized his predecessors and relatives in surviving speeches."

Written in the form of an autobiography of the Roman Emperor Claudius, it tells the history of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the early years of the Roman Empire, from Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC to Caligula's assassination in AD 41. Though the narrative is largely fictionalised, most of the events depicted are drawn from historical accounts of the same time period by the Roman historians Suetonius and Tacitus. [...] as a first-person narrative of Roman history from Claudius' perspective, covering the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula; Claudius the God is written as a later addition documenting Claudius' own reign. The real Claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography (now lost) in eight books that covered the same period."

He composed 20 books of Etruscan and 8 books of Carthaginian history, all in Greek; an autobiography; and a historical treatise on the Roman alphabet with suggestions for orthographical reform—which as emperor he later tried not very successfully to implement. He also wrote on dice playing, of which he was fond. All his works are lost, and their importance cannot be measured. The Etruscan history may have had original material: his first wife, Plautia Urgulanilla, had Etruscan blood, and her family was probably able to put Claudius in touch with authentic Etruscan traditions.

Ill health, unattractive appearance, clumsiness of manner, and coarseness of taste did not recommend him for a public life.

      "snippet": "\\_\n\nRobert Graves began researching Claudius in 1929, but put aside the project shortly thereafter. He began writing I, Claudius in 1932 and the book was published in May 1934. Claudius the God followed just six months later. The narrative device is that the books are Claudius’s secret history of his life, written entirely by himself in Greek (not Latin). At the beginning, Claudius/Graves writes ‘in the present work, I swear by all the Gods, I am my own mere secretary, and my own official annalist’. In contrast, Graves himself did not work alone. [...] The Claudius books were immediately successful. They helped Graves deal with his dire financial problems and they saved his home, Canellun. The novels are remarkable works of historical fiction, which, in addition to describing the machinations of the Imperial court, include detailed accounts of adventures throughout the far-reaching Roman empire. Graves, not surprisingly, showed himself very familiar with military history with a clear anti-German bias. He has Claudius’s brother, the general Germanicus, write in a letter that ‘The Germans … are the most insolent and boastful nation in the world when things go well with them, but once they are defeated they are the most cowardly and abject’. In addition, the books cover Roman education, the different approaches of the Roman historians Livy [...] Mary Beard, Confronting the Classics: Traditions, Adventures, and Innovations (Liveright Publishing Company, New York, 2013) pp. 131-32(review ofImperial Projections: Ancient Rome in Modern Popular Culture’,eds.
