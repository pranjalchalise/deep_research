      "snippet": "## What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. By incorporating new and context-aware data, AI can generate more accurate, current and domain-specific responses.\n\nRAG is quickly becoming the go-to architecture for building enterprise-grade AI applications. According to recent surveys, over 60% of organizations are developing AI-powered retrieval tools to improve reliability, reduce hallucinations and personalize outputs using internal data. [...] 1. Prepare data: Document data is gathered alongside metadata and subjected to initial preprocessing — for example, PII handling (detection, filtering, redaction, substitution). To be used in RAG applications, documents need to be chunked into appropriate lengths based on the choice of embedding model and the downstream LLM application that uses these documents as context.\n2. Index relevant data: Produce document embeddings and hydrate a Vector Search index with this data.\n3. Retrieve relevant data: Retrieving parts of your data that are relevant to a user's query. That text data is then provided as part of the prompt that is used for the LLM. [...] ## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?  \nRAG is an AI architecture that strengthens LLMs by retrieving relevant documents and injecting them into the prompt. This enables more accurate, current and domain-specific responses without taking time to retrain the model.\n\nWhen should I use RAG instead of fine-tuning?  \nUse RAG when you want to incorporate dynamic data without the cost or complexity of fine-tuning. It is ideal for use cases where accurate and timely information is required."

Instead of relying solely on the model’s pre-trained knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant information from connected data sources and uses it to generate a more accurate and context-aware response.\n\nIn GPTs, RAG is performed automatically when knowledge retrieval is enabled and files have been uploaded. The model dynamically retrieves relevant information from those files to supplement the user’s prompt."

      "snippet": "Share\n\nSubscribe to RSS\n\n Back to all posts\n\nOne of the latest advancements in natural language processing (NLP) is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a technique that combines the strengths of information retrieval and natural language generation (NLG). RAG can reshape how software is conceptualized, designed and implemented, ushering in a new era of efficiency and creativity powered by generative models.\n\n## What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a natural language processing (NLP) model that combines two key components: a generator and a retriever.\n\nGenerator: This part creates new content, such as sentences or paragraphs, usually based on large language models (LLMs). [...] Retriever: This part retrieves relevant information from a predetermined set of documents or data.\n\nIn simple terms, RAG uses the retriever to find useful information from a vast collection of texts, and then the generator uses that information to augment its LLM-based training to create new, coherent text. This approach helps improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated content by leveraging new and often more domain-specific knowledge outside of the vast dataset used to train the original LLM. It's commonly used in tasks like answering questions or summarizing text.\n\nRAG integrates these two processes, allowing developers to use a wealth of existing knowledge to augment LLMs to enhance the generation of new, contextually relevant content.\n\n### What does the data look like? [...] ### Data and documentation\n\nRAG can be used to retrieve relevant data from both on-prem and cloud-based data sources. This is particularly useful in a hybrid cloud environment where data may be distributed across multiple locations. By more effectively retrieving and augmenting data, MLOps helps machine learning models access diverse and comprehensive datasets for training and validation.\n\nRAG can also aid in automating documentation and knowledge-sharing processes within MLOps workflows. RAG systems can automatically generate documentation, reports and summaries of machine learning experiments, model evaluations and deployment procedures using NLG capabilities. This helps maintain comprehensive activity records and simplifies knowledge transfer between team members."
