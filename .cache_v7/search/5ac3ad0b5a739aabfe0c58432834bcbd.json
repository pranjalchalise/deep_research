Amherst has family housing which I can’t find anywhere else in nearly the whole state. And to be honest I’m just sick of living in Salem."

After going through the recruiting process myself, here's my advice for what you should be dong each year to give yourself the best chance at getting recruited to play for a college team.\n\nFreshman year:\n\nTake a challenging courseload and get good grades in all of your classes. This year provides the foundation for your GPA and class rank, so make sure you get off to a good start.\n\nWork as hard as you can to improve your ranking/rating in your sport, because you will have the most time this year to focus on your sport. [...] Keep communicating with the coaches you are interested in and express your interest in being a part of their sports program. You can reach out to coaches through email or text if you would like.\n\nSenior year:\n\nMost coaches will ask for your academic stats in the fall to send to admissions for an \"academic pre-read,\" where an admissions officer will look at your stats and determine if you will be admitted.\n\nContinue comparing your options and coaches will invite you for a visit if they would like in the summer or fall. If a coach invites you for a visit, then it means they are interested in you.\n\nKeep doing well in your classes and retake the SAT/ACT for a higher score if needed"

      "snippet": "First, the universities. The fiction that Marxist theory is not taught in economics departments is belied by the fact that many universities around the world, and several in the US, have well-known heterodox programs. I’ve mentioned elsewhere that, in the US, there is the UMASS system (most notably Amherst with Basu, Wolff, Bowles, Gintis, Kotz, and Yoshihara), The New School for Social Research (with Foley, Shaikh, dos Santos), The University of Utah Salt Lake City (Kliman), and a smattering of other schools that have at least some Marxist faculty such as Holyoke and CUNY. Outside the US, there is Queen Mary, Goldsmiths, SOAS, Bielefeld, University of Macedonia, and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki where Veniziani, Lapavitsas, Flaschel, Tsoulfidies, Tsaliki, and others teach and [...] Lastly, I’ll mention some of my own work (although I’m NOT a published economist…yet) because it sheds light on recent directions in Marxist political economy and touches on some modern applications. My research interest is in using input-output tables to measure value transfers in international trade within a Marxian value theoretic framework. The literature on this niche issue alone is large and goes back to unequal exchange debates initiated by Marxists like Arghiri Emmanual, structuralists like Prebisch and Singer, and further developed by GCC and World Systems theorists. Some of the Marxist economists I know have published a wide range of empirical papers on computational methods, simulation-based modeling, national accounts analysis, and more to study everything from microeconomic [...] Second, the journals. There is plenty of scholarly input from Marxist economists, which you can read in respected peer-reviewed journals like The Journal of Political Economy, The Journal of Economic Theory, The Review of Economics and Statistics, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, The Cambridge Journal of Economics, The Review of International Political Economy, The Review of Radical Political Economics, and many more. I personally know and work with some of the Marxist economists who publish in these journals...much of this input is “empirical” (and, again, published in peer-reviewed econometric journals like Metroeconomica and others I’ve already mentioned)."
