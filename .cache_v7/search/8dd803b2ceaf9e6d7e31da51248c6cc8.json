Developers are no longer trying to figure out if their apps are up or down. They’re trying to see if their agents are wrong or right. Then find out why.\nThis new technology requires a new way of building: agent engineering - the iterative process of refining unpredictable LLM systems into something that works. And that’s what we’re focused on.\nToday, LangChain announced we’ve raised a $125M Series B at a $1.25B valuation from IVP, Sequoia, Benchmark, Capital G, Sapphire Ventures and more, to build the platform for agent engineering. Awesome companies - from AI startups like Replit, Clay and Harvey, to enterprises like Cisco and Workday - use our stuff. [...] LangChain is and has always been the real deal. Before there were reasoning models, RL environments, and computer use agents; there was a framework that enabled AI engineers and other developers to quickly prototype, build, and iterate on AI apps by connecting disparate models and model APIs and integrating other services. But as model capabilities have evolved, the company and it's set of tools have too. LangChain is now a robust toolkit for building agentic apps; for creating agents that not only generate outputs but also take action autonomously. They not only help AI engineers build quickly and efficiently but also build apps that are reliable, observable, and secure. Undoubtedly, this company will continue to define what AI infrastructure \\is\\ and what it means to be an AI engineer."
