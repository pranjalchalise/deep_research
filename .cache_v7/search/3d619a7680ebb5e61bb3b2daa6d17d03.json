GoogleBots have begun adding items to carts of participating merchants and proceeding to checkout, to ensure the price at checkout is the same as the price given on the product page. Ultimately, merchants risk disapproval of their items if their pricing is inconsistent.\n\n## The issue with abandoned carts in Google Shopping\n\nSo, GoogleBots are checking for sellers who are gaming the system with dishonest or misleading pricing practices.

But what if your name is, say, John Smith? Standing out on the web is a lot harder when you have a common name.\n\nA LinkedIn search of the name “John Smith” yields 36,761 results, while Google results include a whopping 197 million entries. The result: it takes a lot of work for a potential employer researching you online — and for you to stand out from the crowd. [...] If a recruiter has to work too hard to figure out which John Smith is you, he or she might just move on to the next qualified candidate. In today’s ultra-social, web-heavy job hunt, how can you avoid name confusion and leave no room for a prospective employer to pause after a Google or LinkedIn search?\n\nFor starters, you need to win the results game.\n\n“Google is just a search engine, searching for your name or your ‘real estate’ online,” wrote Ireland-based branding expert Ted Clohosey. “The more real estate you own — the more places your name is mentioned and the more active you are contributing to different media, for example — the more likely you’ll be found.” [...] And the better the chances your information will rank on page one of Google’s results. Being on page one of the results is the equivalent of owning real estate on Fifth Avenue in New York or Bond Street in London, according to Clohosey.\n\n“These are the most expensive retail streets: stores there get the best customers and make the most profits because there is lots of traffic up and down these streets. [They] pay big rents because they want their brand to be exclusively positioned,” he wrote. “You want people who search for you to get that same feeling about your positioning.  Failure to do so will have you in the Google equivalent of languishing on some back street.”"

He had a graying beard and brown hair brushed to the side with a saliva-wetted palm; his plume-colored Gore-Tex parka was in a state of dilapidation. Unlaced hiking shoes enclosed his feet, their tongues lapping like the ears of a Basset Hound.\n\nWould I like to hear an unbelievable story? he asked in a husky, inebriated voice.\n\n“What else is there to do on I-64 near Richmond?” I answered.\n\n“Then I shall tell you how John Smith became the first John Smith that pops up on Google search.”\n\nThe premise excited me.
