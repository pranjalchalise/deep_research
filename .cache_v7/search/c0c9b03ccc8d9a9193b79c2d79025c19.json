      "snippet": "“My days are pretty chill when I’m not travelling,” she concludes.\n\nThat hasn't been often, lately, with Lee's recent travels including a family vacation to Thailand, cut short by a surprise trip to Los Angeles for the ESPY Awards.\n\n“I was actually supposed to be [in Thailand] for a whole month,” said Lee. “I was like, ‘I’m so sorry. I have to go to LA. This is for an ESPY, this is something I can’t miss.’ They were very supportive.”\n\nLee won Comeback Athlete of the Year there, with Dr. Marcia Faustin, who has cared for her since the kidney diagnosis more than two years ago, as her guest.\n\n“She’s been my rock through all this,” said Lee of Faustin. “A lot of people see her as my doctor, but I more see her as a friend, a mentor, my therapist. [...] Though she still has occasional infusions to deal with symptoms of her kidney condition, without the rigours of day-to-day elite gymnastics training, Lee is feeling better than ever.\n\n“My body feels great. I wake up every single day, not in pain, and I don’t have to really worry about anything,” she explained. “It’s just very different now. It’s a lot more controllable, and I’m in a very good system. It’s good.”\n\n> View this post on Instagram\n>\n> A post shared by Sunisa Lee (@sunisalee)\n\n## Comeback Athlete of the Year – and a new pace in the Big Apple\n\nSo, too, is life. [...] “The first one will always be such a surreal feeling,” Lee says of Tokyo. “But, then, coming back from everything at those Olympics, it also being a COVID Olympics, the environment at Paris was just so different.\n\n“It was so much fun,” she continues, “and looking back on it, that was probably the happiest I’ve ever been. It really makes me realise how much love I have for the sport of gymnastics and just competing in general.”\n\nTwo days later, Lee added an all-around bronze medal. That feat made her the first reigning Olympic all-around champion to return to the all-around podium at the subsequent Games since Nadia Comăneci in 1976 and 1980.\n\nIt also helped the American finally believe in her greatness."
