      "snippet": "AI/ML-powered safety systems can predict when and where a safety violation could happen, to\nremedy the situation before it causes harm, according to the BDO consulting group. Among\nother applications, sensors and machine vision cameras combined with AI/ML can trigger\nalerts if they identify or anticipate safety concerns, such as excessive fumes or lack of\npersonal protective equipment. Ergonomic applications include AI/ML-equipped wearables to\nmonitor worker posture and movements for real-time feedback on potential harm.\n\n### 11. Robotics and Automation [...] Machine learning (ML) is rapidly transforming manufacturing by analyzing real-time data from\nshop floor sensors, internal enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, external market\nintelligence and other sources to optimize production and supply chain operations by\ninforming such processes as predictive maintenance and quality control. This data-driven\napproach makes for faster and better decision-making — in turn, boosting productivity,\nminimizing errors and reducing waste. Furthermore, some companies are pushing the boundaries\nby using ML not just to recommend actions based on its powers of pattern recognition, but\nalso to automate the steps it recommends.\n\nHow is machine learning used in the supply chain? [...] How is machine learning used in the supply chain?\n\nMachine learning, with its strengths in delivering data analysis, predictive insights and\nrecommendations, can optimize material flow through supply chain stages, including\ntransportation and storage, to reduce costs, such as stranded capital investment in\nstockpiled raw materials, components and finished products. One way is route optimization,\nfinding the quickest route for sourcing inputs, moving them to the factory floor and then\nshipping final products to customers. Another way is to run simulations tracking inventory\nlevels to predict their potential impact on the production process. Other top uses include\nsupplier selection and due diligence, inventory management, sustainability initiatives and\nconsumer behavior tracking."
