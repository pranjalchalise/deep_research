      "snippet": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected \"Garbage collection (computer science)\"). It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. [...] ## Design philosophy and features\n\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming – including metaprogramming and metaobjects. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is often referred to as a 'glue language' because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages. [...] Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution \"Name resolution (programming languages)\") (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n\nPython's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp \"Lisp (programming language)\") tradition\". It has `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets \"Set (mathematics)\"), and generator \"Generator (computer programming)\") expressions. The standard library has two modules (`itertools` and `functools`) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML."

Python Applications in Education\n\nThanks to its simplicity, brevity, and large community, Python makes for a great introductory programming language. Applications of Python programming in education have a huge scope as it is a great language to teach in schools or even learn on your own.\n\nIf you still haven’t begun, we suggest you read up on what we have to say about the white and dark sides of Python. Also, check out Python Features.\n\n### 6. Python Applications in Business\n\nPython is also a great choice to develop ERP and e-commerce systems: [...] ## What is Python used for?\n\nUnderstandably, Python is a sought-after and beneficial skill to learn. But what areas and profiles are Python programming used in and for? Python is a general-purpose programming language used in numbers, software, and applications beyond our knowledge. Below, we have discussed some of the many uses of Python programming language.\n\n## Features of Python:\n\nABC programming language is considered the successor of the Python programming language. Guido Van Rossum who also contributed to the development of the ABC programming language referred to the ABC language and improved the syntaxes of the ABC to generate a more clean easy and high-level programming language. Python has many features as it gets updates most frequently: [...] Python programming language is used in many areas of development. Due to its easy-to-understand ability and good user interface, it is used in many scientific fields. Many heavy operations Numeric and scientific calculations, Research and development, Scraping, and many more. Some applications are:\n\n Machine Learning\n Artificial Intelligence\n Web Scraping\n Data Science and Analysis\n GUI\n\netc. Python has good library support that allows a programmer to write the program more easily and efficiently. It has library support for machine learning, Scraping, GUI, etc.\n\n### 1. Web and Internet Development"

      "snippet": "## What is Python?\n\nPython is an open-source, object-oriented, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Since this definition may look overwhelming, let's take a look at each characteristic separately to understand what each of them means:\n\n Open-source: it's free and available for further improvements, like adding helpful features or fixing bugs\n Object-oriented: based not on functions but on objects with defined attributes and methods\n High-level: human-friendly rather than computer-friendly\n General purpose: can be used to create any kind of programs\n\nPython is extensively applied in data science, data analysis, machine learning, data engineering, web development, software development, and other fields. [...] The flexibility and power of this programming language allow it to create relatively simple and highly advanced multi-protocol applications or those that involve complex numeric computations.\n\nWith Python, we can build audio or video programs based on AI or ML techniques, APIs (application programming interfaces), GUIs (graphical user interfaces), or any other type of software.\n\n### 6. Python for web development\n\nWhile for building the front end of a website (the part of a website accessible to its users), we would mostly use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its back end (the invisible part of a website), we would often opt for Python."
