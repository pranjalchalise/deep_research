Following this, a chatbot powered by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) was designed to provide tailored conceptual explanations and code examples based on course materials, addressing a range of student inquiries. To evaluate its effectiveness, the study analyzed chatbot interaction logs and survey responses collected at the end of the course. Results showed that students with greater prior knowledge of the subject matter were more likely to engage with the chatbot, primarily seeking help on advanced topics not covered in the course lectures. Overall, students expressed high satisfaction with the chatbot, particularly valuing its ability to provide helpful explanations that are based on the course materials.

To contextualize the development and potential of RAG chatbots, we conducted a literature review on existing approaches and their use in educational settings. Following [...] systems raises several pertinent questions regarding their effectiveness and acceptance among students. Specifically, understanding the factors that influence students' engagement with such chatbots, the reasons behind their non-usage, and the types of queries they find most helpful can provide valuable insights. Additionally, gauging students' overall perceptions and attitudes towards the chatbot can further elucidate its impact on their learning experience (Labadze et al., 2023). In this context, the current study aims to address the following research questions: • RQ1: What factors affect students’ likelihood to use a course chatbot? • RQ2: What are the reasons why students don’t use a course chatbot? • RQ3: What do students actually use a course chatbot for? • RQ4: What do students"

The final implementation indicated that the RAG system can effectively emulate lecturer-style evaluation at scale without compromising pedagogical fidelity. Importantly, the context-grounded feedback produced by the system supports self-regulated learning by enabling students to interpret their scores, identify performance gaps, and monitor their improvement trajectories throughout the semester. 5. Discussion The findings of this study illustrate both the promise and the pedagogical challenges associated with deploying a RAG system for large-scale essay assessment. While the system demonstrated strong reliability particularly its high level of scoring consistency with human assessors and generated feedback that aligned [...] to address these challenges. The system integrates a large language model with a structured retrieval mechanism that accesses rubric criteria, exemplar essays, and instructor feedback to generate contextually grounded grades and formative comments. A mixed-methods evaluation was conducted using 701 student essays, combining quantitative analyses of inter-rater reliability, scoring alignment, and consistency with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative evaluation of feedback quality, pedagogical relevance, and student support. Results demonstrate that the RAG system can produce reliable, rubric-aligned feedback at scale, achieving 94–99% agreement with human evaluators, while also enhancing students’ opportunities for self-regulated learning and engagement with assessment criteria. [...] contextualisation of the feedback, closer alignment with the instructor’s writing style, and minimal need for manual correction. These improvements reflect the cumulative effect of iterative human-in-the-loop refinement of the retrieval corpus, demonstrating that the system can progressively adapt and enhance its pedagogical fidelity over successive assessment cycles. 4.5 Summary of System Performance Across all evaluation phases, the RAG assessment system demonstrated high scoring accuracy, with a correlation of r = 0.89 and a mean absolute error of less than 3%, and showed strong alignment with human feedback patterns. The system’s reliability increased following iterative refinement, and it proved scalable to large cohorts, including 701 student essays, while consistently adhering to"

      "snippet": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI-driven education, enabling innovative applications across various learning and teaching domains. However, LLMs still face several challenges, including hallucination and static internal knowledge, which hinder their reliability in educational settings. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the LLM's generation process. This approach improves factual accuracy and enables dynamic knowledge updates, making LLMs particularly suitable for educational applications. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing research that integrates RAG into educational scenarios. We first clarify the definition and workflow of RAG, and [...] We first clarify the definition and workflow of RAG, and following the indexing mechanism of RAG, we introduce different types of retrievers and generation optimization methods. As the main focus of this work, we explore the practical applications of RAG in education, covering interactive learning systems, generation and assessment of educational content, and large-scale deployment in educational ecosystems. Based on our comprehensive review, this paper discusses existing challenges and future directions, including mitigating hallucinations, ensuring the completeness and timeliness of retrieved knowledge, reducing computational costs, and enhancing multimodal support for RAG-based educational applications."
