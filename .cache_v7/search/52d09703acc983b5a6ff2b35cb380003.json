Ha is interested in how different sensory modalities shape behaviors and plans to pursue a Ph.D. degree. Outside the lab, Ha works with the Center for Teaching and Learning and the Strategic Learning Center to help improve the teaching and learning on campus. In his free time, you would find him taking photographs or biking along the Norwottuck Rail Trail, trying out new coffee recipes, or jamming with friends with his cajon.
