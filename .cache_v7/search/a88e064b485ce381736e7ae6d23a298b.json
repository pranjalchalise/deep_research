      "snippet": "Depending on the specific use case, data scientists may choose to use different programming languages. Python or R are languages that are useful for performing analysis, applying statistics to data, and building AI/ML models. Many data scientists also use SQL to manipulate data and extract relevant insights, especially for data analytics and business intelligence use cases.\n\n## Why Is Python Used for Data Science?\n\nPython is one of the most popular languages for data science and machine learning because it’s versatile and has a vibrant open-source ecosystem. As such, there is a large community of developers who create libraries and tools to make Python easier to use. In fact, the Python Package Index (PyPI) has hundreds of thousands of open-source packages available. [...] ### Anaconda\n\nAnaconda is a Python distribution and comprehensive platform that comes with many data science and machine learning packages, as well as a package manager called Conda to easily install more. The platform has an IDE called Spyder, which is tailored for scientific computing and data analysis in Python. Many data scientists choose Anaconda for its interactive console, debugging tools, data exploration capabilities, and support for ML and AI models, as well as its ability to facilitate the secure use of open source for enterprises.\n\n### Jupyter Notebook [...] Tools such as Anaconda Notebooks, AI Assistant, and AI Navigator make it even easier for data scientists to get started with Python, as well as share code and collaborate on data projects. This is a community for learning and working together to accelerate innovation with data science, Anaconda, and Python.  \n   \nRequest a demo to see if Anaconda is right for your data science and machine learning projects. Or, if you’re curious to experiment with Anaconda on your own, you can get started for free."

      "snippet": "### Data Analysis and Manipulation\n\nAnalyzing and manipulating data is crucial for most data science and machine learning workflows. This requires capabilities to handle different data structures depending on the size and format of a particular data set.\n\nA Python library like NumPy can provide powerful array and mathematical operations functionality, and pandas can offer additional data structures as well. Other options include Dask for handling large datasets and the comprehensive ecosystem of PyData libraries for other data requirements.\n\n### Data Visualization\n\nData visualization is important for clearly conveying the insights from data science projects to stakeholders. Different Python libraries enable data scientists to create unique visualizations suitable for specific datasets. [...] Anaconda is a powerful platform for data science and machine learning. It provides a vast collection of pre-installed libraries, a robust package manager, and efficient environment management capabilities. The platform comes with many popular data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and ML libraries so that users can get started immediately.\n\nAdditionally, Anaconda has a built-in package manager called conda, which makes it easy to install, update, and manage Python libraries commonly used for different use cases. The platform also allows users to create isolated environments, each with its own set of libraries. These capabilities simplify the process of setting up and maintaining environments for different projects without running into dependency conflicts. [...] ##### Table of Contents\n\n## Introduction\n\nPython has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages because of its versatility for a wide range of tasks, from data manipulation and analysis to machine learning and web development. Along with its flexibility and simple syntax, Python has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify complex tasks and facilitate rapid development.\n\nAlthough the Python Standard Library provides a lot of native functionality out of the box, it’s easy to install additional open-source packages to extend Python’s capabilities. This means data scientists can choose from hundreds of libraries from a centralized package repository to make their workflows more efficient."

As you might remember, we installed Jupyter Notebook and Python with the Anaconda Navigator. And this means that we already have installed some popular libraries used in Python for data analysis. By the way, one of the alternatives of Jupyter Notebook is Jupyter Lab. Both are similar, but we're going to use Jupyter Notebook in this course because of its simplicity. So, let's open Jupyter Notebook. And to do that, we have to click here on the launch button. So I click here. And now we wait a couple of seconds. And now we have here the interface of Jupyter Notebook. So I'm going to maximize this. And by default, Jupyter Notebook opens the root directory of your computer. It's a good"
