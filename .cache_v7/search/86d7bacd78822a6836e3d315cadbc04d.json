C. Sproul Jr. |\n| Ordination | UPCUSA (1965–1975)   PCA (1975–2017) |\n|  |\n| Theological work |\n| Tradition or movement | Reformed (Presbyterianism)  Methodism (early years) | [...] Sproul was an advocate of Reformed theology in his many print, audio, and video publications, and advocated the Thomistic (classical) approaches to Christian apologetics, less common among Reformed apologists, most of whom prefer presuppositionalism.[citation needed] A dominant theme in his Renewing Your Mind lessons is the holiness and sovereignty of God. Sproul taught that headcovering should be practiced in churches as the ordinance is \"rooted and grounded in creation\". [...] Gerstner convinced Sproul to study under G. C. Berkouwer at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Free University of Amsterdam) in Holland, where he initiated study in 1964. Sproul was granted leave in 1965 due to his wife's second pregnancy and mother's illness (during which he was appointed to teach philosophy at Westminster College \"Westminster College (Pennsylvania)\")), and later resumed study at distance. He returned to Holland in 1969 to receive a doctorandus degree.\n\nHe married Vesta Voorhis in 1960 and had two children, Sherrie Dorotiak and Robert Craig Sproul.\n\nSproul was a passenger on the Amtrak train that derailed in the 1993 Big Bayou Canot train wreck, and sometimes gave firsthand accounts of the story.\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]"
