      "snippet": "The roots of machine learning can be traced back to the 1940s, when researchers began to explore very basic pattern recognition and the development of the first neural networks. This early period of ML history was marked by groundbreaking ideas and the relentless pursuit of creating computers that could mimic human thought processes. In 1943, Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch devised the first mathematical model of a neural network, laying the groundwork for modern neural networks and the development of distributed machine learning toolkits. [...] ## Summary\n\nThe history of machine learning is a captivating tale of human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of creating computers that can learn, adapt, and make informed decisions.

      "snippet": "Machine learning (ML) has evolved dramatically from its early foundations in statistical methods to the deep learning architectures we see today. This paper takes a historical perspective on the development of machine learning, diving into major eras that have shaped its landscape: from the classical regression models to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), and the transformative impact of the attention mechanism with the rise of transformers. Each era is defined by its unique paradigm, challenges, and breakthroughs. The goal of this paper is to not only chronicle the development of machine learning but also build an intuitive understanding of the technical depth within each phase, from classical statistical models to the state-of-the-art architectures [...] ## 1. Introduction\n\nMachine learning, at its core, is the science of making machines learn from data, enabling them to make decisions without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. While the concept of “learning” has its roots in centuries-old statistical methods, it has evolved through various stages — each phase characterized by new methods, challenges, and computational techniques.

Right now we're in the information age, and many young people (myself included) can't imagine a society before phones, constant data collection and the information economy. [...] Spanning decades of innovative research and technological breakthroughs, there was a remarkable progression from Machine Learning's early theoretical foundations to the transformative impact ML now has on modern society. The history of machine learning reflects humanity's quest to create computers in our own image; to imbue machines with the ability to learn, adapt, and make intelligent decisions. This is a journey that has reshaped industries, redefined human-computer interaction, and ushered in an era of unprecedented possibilities.\n\nAlan Zenreich, Creative Black Book: Photography (1985) [...] Alan Zenreich, Creative Black Book: Photography (1985)\n\nFor what Machine Learning is, you can take a look at What is Machine Learning?, the previous blog in this series.

      "snippet": "Pioneers named Turing, Samuel, McCarthy, Minsky, Edmonds and Newell dotted the machine learning landscape in the 1950s, when the Turing Test, the first artificial neural network, and the terms artificial intelligence and machine learning were conceived.\n Eliza, the first chatbot; Shakey, the first mobile intelligent robot; Stanford Cart, a video-controlled remote vehicle; and the foundations of deep learning were developed in the 1960s.\n Programs that recognize patterns and handwritten characters, solve problems based on natural selection, seek appropriate actions, create rules to discard unimportant information, and learn like a baby learns to pronounce words highlighted the 1970s and 1980s. [...] Oliver Selfridge published \"Pandemonium: A Paradigm for Learning,\" a landmark contribution to machine learning that described a model capable of adaptively improving itself to find patterns in events.\n\n### 1960\n\nMechanical engineering graduate student James Adams constructed the Stanford Cart to support his research on the problem of controlling a remote vehicle using video information.\n\n### 1963\n\nDonald Michie developed a program named MENACE, or Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine, which learned how to play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe.\n\n### 1965\n\nEdward Feigenbaum, Bruce G. Buchanan, Joshua Lederberg and Carl Djerassi developed DENDRAL, the first expert system, which assisted organic chemists in identifying unknown organic molecules.\n\n### 1966 [...] ### 1981\n\nGerald Dejong introduced explanation-based learning in which a computer learned to analyze training data and create a general rule for discarding information deemed unimportant.\n\n### 1985\n\nTerry Sejnowski created a program named NetTalk, which learned to pronounce words like the way a baby learns.\n\n### 1989\n\nYann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio and Patrick Haffner demonstrated how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to recognize handwritten characters, showing that neural networks could be applied to real-world problems.\n\nChristopher Watkins developed Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement algorithm that sought the best action to take in any current state.\n\nAxcelis released Evolver, the first commercially available genetic algorithm software package for personal computers."

AI and ML implementation is increasing across a multitude of use cases and industries, while governments and regulatory authorities invest in reports on the potential of AI and host summits about its practical ramifications. [...] Throughout the 1950s, the first major experiments in artificial intelligence took place. While the groundwork for what would become modern machine learning was laid more than 70 years ago, it struggled with the technological limitations of the day. Besides lacking the sheer computing power needed for complex calculations, old computers could only execute commands and not follow them, an important aspect of modern machine learning. [...] As predicted in Moore's Law and demonstrated in the following graph, the value-to-performance ratio of computing component's such as GPUs has improved over time. Starting in 2006, NVIDIA's GeForce 7900 GS AGP had a performance value of 54 million floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s) per US dollar. By 2021, that value had risen to 42.59 billion FLOP/s/$ with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 GPU.\n\nThis period also saw the open sourcing of AI frameworks. As more foundational models became accessible through programs like TensorFlow by Google, PyTorch by Meta, MXnet by AWS, researchers working on ML theory and algorithms were able to transfer their theoretical work more easily into practical systems."
