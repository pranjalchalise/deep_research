      "snippet": "In grading, RAG helps the AI fetch the correct or ideal answer based on your curriculum, and then intelligently compare it with what the student wrote.\n\n### How This Actually Works\n\nImagine you’ve got a student answering this question:\n\n“Explain the greenhouse effect.”\n\nHere’s what happens behind the scenes in an AI-powered grading system:\n\n1. Student submits the answer.\n\n2. The RAG system pulls the most relevant explanation from your class material (so it’s aligned with what was taught, not just a random internet definition).\n\n3. The LLM reads the student’s answer and compares it with the reference.\n\n4. It gives a score, along with feedback like:\n\n“Great start! You mentioned heat trapping but missed how greenhouse gases work. Try adding that next time.”\n\nPretty cool, right? [...] Thanks to advances in AI, especially with large language models (LLMs) and a technique called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we now have a powerful way to automate answer evaluation while keeping things accurate, fair, and fast.\n\nLet us see how this work and why it might just be the future of grading.\n\n### First Things First: What is RAG?\n\nRAG (retrieval-augmented generation) is kind of like giving a super-smart AI access to a cheat sheet and then asking it to reason based on what it found.\n\nHere is how it breaks down:\n\n• Retrieval: The system pulls relevant info from a knowledge base (like class notes, textbooks, or slides).\n\n• Generation: The LLM uses that info to generate a response, evaluate an answer, or even provide feedback. [...] Pretty cool, right?\n\n### Why This Is a Game-Changer for Educators\n\n✅ It Understands Context\n\nTraditional automated systems often just keyword-match. But RAG+LLM actually “reads” and “understands” in a human-like way, so it’s not just checking if the student said the exact words, but whether they understood the concept.\n\n✅ It is Consistent and Fair\n\nNo tired eyes. No Monday-morning mood swings. Just reliable, unbiased grading, every time.\n\n✅ It Scales Like Magic\n\nWhether it’s 20 answers or 2,000, the system handles it effortlessly in seconds.\n\n✅ It Gives Meaningful Feedback\n\nInstead of just a number, students can get real pointers to improve — which is what learning is all about.\n\n### Where This Works Best\n\n• School assessments: For short answers and essays."

As the main focus of this work, we explore the practical applications of RAG in education, covering interactive learning systems, generation and assessment of educational content, and large-scale deployment in educational ecosystems. Based on our comprehensive review, this paper discusses existing challenges and future directions, including mitigating hallucinations, ensuring the completeness and timeliness of retrieved knowledge, reducing computational costs, and enhancing multimodal support for RAG-based educational applications. [...] Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI-driven education, enabling innovative applications across various learning and teaching domains. However, LLMs still face several challenges, including hallucination and static internal knowledge, which hinder their reliability in educational settings. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the LLM's generation process. This approach improves factual accuracy and enables dynamic knowledge updates, making LLMs particularly suitable for educational applications. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing research that integrates RAG into educational scenarios.

      "title": "An LLM -Powered Assessment Retrieval-Augmented Generation ...",
      "snippet": "> Abstract:Providing timely, consistent, and high-quality feedback in large-scale higher education courses remains a persistent challenge, often constrained by instructor workload and resource limitations. This study presents an LLM-powered, agentic assessment system built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to address these challenges. The system integrates a large language model with a structured retrieval mechanism that accesses rubric criteria, exemplar essays, and instructor feedback to generate contextually grounded grades and formative comments. A mixed-methods evaluation was conducted using 701 student essays, combining quantitative analyses of inter-rater reliability, scoring alignment, and consistency with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative [...] with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative evaluation of feedback quality, pedagogical relevance, and student support. Results demonstrate that the RAG system can produce reliable, rubric-aligned feedback at scale, achieving 94--99% agreement with human evaluators, while also enhancing students' opportunities for self-regulated learning and engagement with assessment criteria. The discussion highlights both pedagogical limitations, including potential constraints on originality and feedback dialogue, and the transformative potential of RAG systems to augment instructors' capabilities, streamline assessment workflows, and support scalable, adaptive learning environments. This research contributes empirical evidence for the application of agentic AI in higher education, offering a [...] We gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and all contributors.

      "snippet": "Generative AI\n\n# Using RAG assessment categories\n\nWe have adopted a three-tiered Red / Amber / Green (RAG) system to articulate how students can use Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools in summative assessments.\n\nThe three categories of red, amber and green are intended as a tool so that staff and students have a shared understanding of how generative AI tools can be used in a particular assessment, and to what extent.\n\n## Applying Red / Amber / Green assessment categories\n\nYou should assign one of these categories to each summative assessment:\n\nPlease note all categories are subject to reasonable adjustments. We are currently working on what it means to provide reasonable adjustments while maintaining competence standards. [...] ## RED considerations\n\n## RED\n\nGen AI tools cannot be used as the learning objectives and/or outcomes make it inappropriate or impractical for Gen AI tools to be used. Assessments in the red category must be supervised or invigilated.\n\nConsider these questions to inform your rationale for not allowing students to use Gen AI in any capacity: [...] More information about these categories, and the types of assessment often associated with them, can be found in the Generative AI guidance for taught students.\n\nWhen you are categorising assessments, please also see the key questions to consider about Gen AI and assessment (only available for University of Leeds staff through the Staff Intranet).\n\nThere is further information on the University of Leeds Staff Intranet in the AI Hub.\n\nDigital Education Enhancement teams will provide in-person workshops for faculties exploring these questions. You are advised to attend one of these if you are involved in setting, marking or supporting assessments, whether or not you plan to change how you assess because of Gen AI tools.\n\n## RED considerations\n\n## RED"
