      "snippet": "President Robert E. Lee played an important and critical role in the development of Washington College after the Civil War. He expanded enrollment, enhanced the endowment, transformed the curriculum, and established a code of honor and conduct for students. Without President Lee’s unique personal contributions, Washington College would never have become the prosperous and highly-regarded Washington and Lee University of modern times.\n\nIndeed, leaders of the North and South hailed President Lee’s contributions to higher education and national reconciliation on the occasion of the centennial of his birth in 1907. [...] At Washington College Lee drew on his experiences at West Point and adapted education to the needs of the South as a whole.  By helping to educate a new generation of leaders, Lee did much to facilitate recovery and help the South rejoin the national economy.   Progress was slow.  But repair to the transportation network and infrastructure gradually attracted northern investment.  Graduates of programs set up under Robert E. Lee became leaders in the professions of law and medicine, and as businessmen they created jobs and employment opportunities for individuals of all races.   No wonder then that Robert E. Lee was widely admired for his post-Civil War contributions to education.  In November 1870, immediately after his death, the trustees of Washington College honored him by changing [...] In reflecting on Robert E. Lee’s contributions as an educator and leader in the post-Civil War period, it is worth emphasizing that the Southern economy was in ruins.  The rail system was shattered and agriculture in shambles. Farmers lacked work animals for plowing fields.  Many former soldiers had few marketable skills.  Some needed remedial education.  Under Lee’s direction Washington College provided learning opportunities.  For the benefit of young men who had been prevented by the war from obtaining adequate preparation for college, the college even offered elementary instruction in Latin, Greek, mathematics and English.(#_ftn14)"

      "snippet": "In 1865, Lee became president of Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia; as president of the college, he supported reconciliation between the North and South. Lee accepted the termination of slavery provided for by the Thirteenth Amendment, but opposed racial equality for African Americans. After his death in 1870, Lee became a cultural icon in the South and is largely hailed as one of the Civil War's greatest generals. As commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, he fought most of his battles against armies of significantly larger size, and managed to win many of them. Lee built up a collection of talented subordinates, most notably James Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson, and J. E. B.

      "snippet": "### A new life in Lexington\n\nLee arrived in Lexington in mid-September 1865 and went to work immediately. Over the next five years, Washington College grew physically and financially: the faculty increased in size from four to twenty, enrollment grew from fifty to nearly 400 students, and financial contributions poured in from both southern and northern sources. Lee's personal involvement with many of his students reflected his desire to create a new generation of Americans. In response to the bitterness of a Confederate widow, Lee wrote, \"Dismiss from your mind all sectional feeling, and bring [your children] up to be Americans.\" [...] Lee's tireless devotion to his duty as president of Washington College eventually took its toll on his health. The outward signs of the heart condition that had plagued him since the Civil War grew more apparent, and in the spring of 1870, on the advice of the faculty, he travelled south on vacation. Less than a month into the next school year, on September 28, 1870, he suffered a massive stroke. Two weeks later, on October 12, Robert E. Lee died in his home on the college campus.\n\nImage\n\nOpen lap desk belonging to Robert E. Lee while president of Washington College showing personal documents and tools organized inside.\n\n### Lee's lap desk [...] The solitude did not last long. The trustees of Washington College in Lexington, then looking for a new president, decided that Lee was the perfect choice. He had been superintendent of West Point earlier in his military career, and more importantly, he had a very recognizable name in 1865. The college, mired in financial difficulties, needed a prominent person to help raise funds. At first Lee hesitated, but on the advice of friends and family he eventually accepted the position. He wrote to the trustees that he believed, \"it is the duty of every citizen, in the present condition of the Country, to do all in his power to aid in the restoration of peace and harmony.\"\n\n### A new life in Lexington"

[...] I don’t care what it is.” Alright. I want you think about something\nright here as I start to read this part of it. Most of you already know or are familiar\nwith Civil War know what buildings this represents. This is actually Washington College on the,\nin Lexington Virginia right here. I want you to think about something right now though\nas I get into it. If you’re Robert E. Lee what would you do after the war? I mean, I\ndon’t know if there’s a right or a wrong answer, I’m just pondering. If you’re\nRobert E. Lee what do you do? Now the state of the college itself is that it had been\nheavily damaged during the war. The library had been scattered, Federal soldiers had been\nusing some of the buildings for barracks, the college had been kept open as a prep school. [...] it often because he was always in the public eye. He had that exterior, he was the marble\nman. But behind closed doors, and in certain instances, he would laugh. He loved it. Lee\nwould end up telling the kids, one of them his name was Graham. “Well, Mr. Graham,\nyour plan to find out who was taking your wood was a good one but your powder charge\nwas too heavy. I would recommend that the next time you use less powder.” Laughter.\nNope. You want to get inside Robert E. Lee’s psyche right there? That is, that story right\nthere is one that Lee would relate when he was president of Washington College to people\nand he would always get a kick out of that. The time that there was a murder plot on his\ncampus. Right there. Alright, in ’68 Lee is going to go on his"
