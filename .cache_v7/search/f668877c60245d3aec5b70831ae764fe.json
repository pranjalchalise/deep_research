LLMs are large deep-learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data that can generate responses to user queries—for example, answering questions or creating images from text-based prompts. LangChain provides tools and abstractions to improve the customization, accuracy, and relevancy of the information the models generate. For example, developers can use LangChain components to build new prompt chains or customize existing templates. LangChain also includes components that allow LLMs to access new data sets without retraining.\n\nRead about Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\n## Why is LangChain important? [...] LangChain streamlines intermediate steps to develop such data-responsive applications, making prompt engineering more efficient. It is designed to develop diverse applications powered by language models more effortlessly, including chatbots, question-answering, content generation, summarizers, and more.\n\nThe following sections describe benefits of LangChain.\n\n### Repurpose language models [...] ### Simplify AI development\n\nLangChain simplifies artificial intelligence (AI) development by abstracting the complexity of data source integrations and prompt refining. Developers can customize sequences to build complex applications quickly. Instead of programming business logic, software teams can modify templates and libraries that LangChain provides to reduce development time.\n\n### Developer support\n\nLangChain provides AI developers with tools to connect language models with external data sources. It is open-source and supported by an active community. Organizations can use LangChain for free and receive support from other developers proficient in the framework.\n\n## How does LangChain work?"

As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\n\n## History\n\n[edit] [...] | LangChain |\n\n| Developer | Harrison Chase |\n| Initial release | October 2022 |\n| Stable release | 0.1.16 / 11 April 2024; 21 months ago (11 April 2024) |\n|  |\n| Repository \"Repository (version control)\") | github.com/langchain-ai/langchain |\n| Written in | Python \"Python (programming language)\") and JavaScript |\n| Type | Software framework for large language model application development |\n| License | MIT License |\n| Website | LangChain.com |\n\n Free and open-source software portal [...] ## History\n\n[edit]\n\nLangChain was launched in October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark \"Benchmark (venture capital firm)\").\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) was introduced, which provides a declarative way to define chains of actions.\n\nIn October 2023 LangChain introduced LangServe, a deployment tool to host LCEL code as a production-ready API."

It provides tools and components to connect LLMs with various data sources, enabling the creation of complex, multi-step workflows.\n\nAvailable as libraries in Python and JavaScript, LangChain helps developers enhance LLM capabilities beyond text generation by linking them to external data and computation. This helps facilitate the development of advanced AI applications like intelligent chatbots, sophisticated question-answering systems, and automated data analysis tools.\n\nGet started for free\n\nBuild AI-powered apps on Vertex AI with LangChain\n\n# LangChain and AI [...] ## How does LangChain work?\n\nLangChain works by \"chaining\" together different components to create a cohesive workflow for LLM-powered applications. This modular approach breaks down complex language-based AI systems into reusable parts. When a user submits a query, LangChain can process this input through a series of steps.\n\nFor example, a typical workflow might involve: [...] This chaining approach lets developers define a sequence of actions their application will take to handle a user's request and create a response. By simplifying these steps into components, LangChain makes it easier to build applications that need multiple interactions with an LLM or external resources. The framework also offers ways to work with different LLMs, giving developers the freedom to choose the best model for their specific application.\n\nLearn more about how you can use LangChain with Vertex AI.\n\n## Key features of LangChain\n\nLangChain provides a suite of features designed to facilitate the development of LLM-powered applications. These features are organized around core concepts that help manage interactions with models, connect to data, and orchestrate complex behaviors."

      "snippet": "LangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\n### Importing language models [...] My IBM\n\nLog in\n\nSubscribe\n\n# What is LangChain?\n\n## Authors\n\nDave Bergmann\n\nSenior Staff Writer, AI Models\n\nIBM Think\n\nCole Stryker\n\nStaff Editor, AI Models\n\nIBM Think\n\n## LangChain overview\n\nLangChain is an open source orchestration framework for application development using large language models (LLMs). Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and AI agents. [...] LangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response."
