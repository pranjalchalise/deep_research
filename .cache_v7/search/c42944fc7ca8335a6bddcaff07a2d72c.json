His 2026 Cyber Talks Calendar isn’t just a media kit; it’s a call to arms and a challenge to school boards, community groups and associations that say they care about children’s digital literacy and cybersafety. [...] It also connects youth to volunteer opportunities with the KnowledgeFlow Foundation and other local nonprofits, where they can work with other Cybersafety Educators to make seniors, new Canadians, and other vulnerable sectors #UnHackable.\nA Call to Action Popa is challenging every school board in Canada to help reach the 100,000 student milestone by booking one or more sessions in 2026.\nHe is also inviting publishers, journalists, and media outlets to download the full 2026 Media Kit, explore the calendar of talks, and spotlight this national initiative, powered by the next generation of #UnHackable Cybersafety Champions. [...] Rights Movement Popa’s approach is to create awareness by turning young people into Cybersafety Champions, amplifying awareness with each new badge earned by a passionate, “UnHackable” youth. By training the trainers, Popa transforms the public’s resistance to cyber education into a viral campaign for reaching ever more learners."

Media Smarts has the first wide-ranging survey of digital literacy skills among youth in Canada, “Young Canadians in a Wired World,” which was based on a 2013 poll of over 5,000 students in public Canadian K-12 education. They found that most Canadian youth have a basic level of digital literacy skills, and that they overwhelmingly learn these skills from parents and teachers (Media Smarts, 2015). This is the only measurement of its kind of digital literacy skills in Canada, and it was defined by simple tripartite understand of literacy, assessing the students’ ability to use, understand, and create digital technology. Each of these skills had subsets such as verifying information found on the web and understanding privacy online. However, the study did not [...] and Hanna, 2011); this remains the case in rural and remote communities. These programs focused on youth as well as on connecting rural Canada to infrastructure. Reports noted that what was crucial was access to the “means of using what the infrastructure enables,” though no national inclusion strategy was adopted as of 2008. Graham and Hanna assess that Canada’s early digital programs saw 44 technologies themselves as primary agents of change, and focused on their value to economic markets, failing to consider the need to transform socioeconomic structures and markets. Canada’s digital divide has tended to mirror the fault lines caused by its vast landmass and cultural history: there is a strong urban/rural divide which has excluded indigenous communities, low income families, and [...] However, there was significant in-country variation. The study also noted that digital problem-solving skills varied with age and education level – PS-TRE scores were lower than the OECD average in Nunavut and Newfoundland. Canada also had a higher proportion of its population at the highest and lowest levels of literacy, suggesting a large national divide. While PIAAC’s PS-TRE measurements cannot be used as a proxy for digital literacy, it does shed some light on the digital skills of Canadians. It is likely that digital literacy is affected by similar intervening factors (age, education, gender), for example. The aforementioned Canadian Science Policy Conference (2015) panel underscored the importance of including young women, indigenous youth, and youth living in poverty in digital"

Sex and age are included. Age is categorized using 5-year increments from age 15 to 34, and broader 15-year increments from age 35 to 64. These age groups provide the detail needed to identify differences across adolescents and youth, as well as the basis for broader comparisons across the population of non-seniors. As shown in Table 2, 10% to 12% of respondents are in each of the 5-year age categories from age 15 to 19 to age 30 to 34 years. Other sociodemographic characteristics, most notably educational attainment, are not included in the analysis given the emphasis on youth and the fact that many of them have not yet completed [...] Other outcomes were also more prevalent among youth, broadly defined to include individuals in their twenties and early-thirties. Around 20% of social media users under age 30 reported feeling anxious or depressed as a result of their social media use compared with 12% of those aged 35 to 49 (Table 3); multivariate results yield a difference of 5 to 6 percentage points (Table 5). Social media users aged 20 to 34 were also significantly more likely to report feeling envious of the lives of others than those aged 35 to 49, with multivariate results yielding differences of 5 to 9 percentage points.

When I asked Kara if Canada should be aiming for an international standard for comparison with the rest of the world, she acknowledged that the OECD has measurements in place but that she considers them very Eurocentric. “We are really advocating for a system that is designed and built in Canada, for Canada. Intersections with digital equity and inclusion and closing digital divides is really core to this work.” In a Canadian context, building digital media literacy competencies and measurements means “consulting with Indigenous communities, newcomers, and non-English speaking persons among others who have specific [...] Youth were also aware of the primary commercial purposes of the sites they used regularly and that they belonged to businesses using features like targeted ads. “They’re very aware that a lot of these platforms, about 90% of them, are corporately run and driven.
