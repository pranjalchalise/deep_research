      "snippet": "|  |  |\n --- |\n| Prerequisites: | Familiarity with the core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages, and the terminal/command line. |\n| Learning outcomes: | Set up a local React development environment, create a start app, and understand the basics of how it works. |\n\n## Hello React\n\nAs its official tagline states, React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications. [...] To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development frameworks. When we refer to React as a \"framework\", we're working with that colloquial understanding.\n\nReact's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user interface. These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.\n\n## Use cases [...] ## Use cases\n\nUnlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around code conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to adopt React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface.\n\nWhile React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not as easy to \"drop into\" an application as a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable when you build your entire app with React."

      "snippet": "Above all else, one of the key attractions of using React is its declarative nature — it makes code easier to understand and debug because it describes what your application should look like in various states rather than detailing step-by-step instructions on achieving that look. This makes your code more predictable and easier for both you and others on your team to work with.\n\n## What are the core features of React?\n\nReact is known for its component-based architecture. Components are independent, reusable pieces of code that function as building blocks of a React application. The combination of these components creates complex user interfaces. Moreover, each component can manage its own state, which means it can hold and manipulate data within itself. [...] # React.js overview\n\nReact is a powerful JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web and native applications.\n\n## What is React?\n\nReact, often referred to as React.js or ReactJS, is a JavaScript library known for its flexibility and efficiency in creating interactive user interfaces (UIs) for both web and native applications. With its component-based architecture, developers can create UI elements like buttons or search bars, which can then be reused throughout an application. This not only streamlines the development process but also enhances maintainability. [...] Another frequent use case is building complex user interfaces with multiple components that share and manage data. The component-based architecture of React enables developers to break down complex UIs into manageable parts, making development more efficient and maintainable.\n\nReact's ability to create reusable components also makes it ideal for rapid prototyping. Designers can quickly construct app layouts and test them without having to write extensive code.\n\nDue to its efficient rendering capabilities, React is commonly used in situations where performance is key such as real-time data updates in applications like stock trading platforms or live chat boxes."

      "snippet": "## State​\n\nWhile you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!\n\ninfo\n\nAs a general rule, use props to configure a component when it renders. Use state to keep track of any component data that you expect to change over time.\n\nThe following example takes place in a cat cafe where two hungry cats are waiting to be fed. Their hunger, which we expect to change over time (unlike their names), is stored as state. To feed the cats, press their buttons—which will update their state. [...] ## JSX​\n\nReact and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: `Hello, I am your cat!`. The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, `name`, and embedding it with curly braces inside .\n\nAny JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls like `{getFullName(\"Rum\", \"Tum\", \"Tugger\")}`:\n\n TypeScript\n JavaScript\n\nYou can think of curly braces as creating a portal into JS functionality in your JSX!\n\ntip\n\nBecause JSX is included in the React library, it won’t work if you don’t have `import React from 'react'` at the top of your file!\n\n## Custom Components​ [...] Re-watch the latest React Native Keynote from React Conf 2025\n\n# React Fundamentals\n\nReact Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.\n\nWe’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:\n\n components\n JSX\n props\n state\n\nIf you want to dig deeper, we encourage you to check out React’s official documentation.\n\n## Your first component​\n\nThe rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.

      "snippet": "We want to hear from youTake our 2021 Community Survey!\n\nThis site is no longer updated.Go to react.dev\n\nReact\n\nv18.2.0 LanguagesGitHub\n\n# Virtual DOM and Internals\n\n### What is the Virtual DOM?\n\nThe virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.\n\nThis approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app. [...] Since “virtual DOM” is more of a pattern than a specific technology, people sometimes say it to mean different things. In React world, the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements since they are the objects representing the user interface. React, however, also uses internal objects called “fibers” to hold additional information about the component tree. They may also be considered a part of “virtual DOM” implementation in React.\n\n### Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?\n\nNo, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.\n\n### What is “React Fiber”? [...] ### What is “React Fiber”?\n\nFiber is the new reconciliation engine in React 16. Its main goal is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM.
