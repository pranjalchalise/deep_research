Current or planned research around Cybersecurity awareness and prevention includes a focus on measuring effectiveness, assisting behaviour change, and future technologies. At a federal level, the implementation of the 2018 cyber security strategy has required data gathering to understand where Canada is investing in cybersecurity and where there may be potential gaps. The national get cybersafe effort has been is also looking to understand how it is working and public opinions on the effort. Within universities, there is planned research into a variety of topics.

However, it can provide some indication of how the community across Canada perceives the environment and the needs for the immediate future in cybersecurity education training and awareness. Research In Schools Efforts to assist in the development of cybersecurity education in schools has involved various methods. A collaboration between Carleton University and Media Smarts has developed a game designed to teach kids from 10 to 13 years old about digital literacy and privacy. This game is currently being deployed in schools by MediaSmarts. The Knowledge Flow Cyber-Safety Foundation has a K12 cyber safety curriculum. The aim of this program is to reach students by going into schools and school boards and plugging any awareness or content gaps that they have.

      "snippet": "These days, youth may not understand the consequences of illegal activities online. Unfortunately, the internet is full of opportunities to practice new technological skills in the wrong places. Often, young people commit cyber crimes without even realizing they are breaking the law. While this can start small, these actions have serious legal consequences. Practicing cyber crime opens the possibility of serious repercussions and young Canadians also risk missing out on exciting avenues to use their technological skills for good. [...] At the RCMP's National Cybercrime Coordination Centre (NC3), we strive to divert potential cyber offenders towards lawful use of their skills and help Canadian youth make informed choices when using technology. Through learning about illegal cyber activity and the Criminal Code, our goal is for young Canadians to use technology in positive and legal ways.\n\n## Understanding cybercrime\n\nWhen technology plays an important role in committing a criminal offence, it may be considered a cybercrime.

      "snippet": "As a result, Public Safety Canada engaged Directions Evidence and Policy Research Group to gather information about existing programs designed to address cyberbullying among children (ages 6-11), youth (ages 12-17), and young adults (ages 18-25) in Canada or abroad.\n\n## Method\n\nBased on the literature review, online search, and input from cyberbullying experts, 98 cyberbullying programs were initially identified. Programs were screened according to rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a sample of 35 programs for further review. Program profiles, including information about the program structure, target audience, theoretical basis and measures of effectiveness, were developed for each.\n\n## Findings [...] Many programs that seek to address cyberbullying are of short duration, do not include special preparations or considerations for vulnerable groups, and appear superficial in their treatment of underlying root causes. Thus, they are likely to be ineffective. Systematic and programmatic evaluation is needed to assess the impact on both the general population and particularly vulnerable subgroups, as well as to evaluate the value of individual program components in order to determine what actually works and in what context.\n\n## Source\n\nFor more information on research at the Community Safety and Countering Crime Branch, Public Safety Canada, to get a copy of the full research report, or to be placed on our distribution list, please contact: [...] Research Division, Public Safety Canada  \n340 Laurier Avenue West, K1A 0P8  \nOttawa, Ontario  \nPS.CPBResearch-RechercheSPC.SP@ps-sp.gc.ca\n\nResearch Summaries are produced for the Community Safety and Countering Crime Branch, Public Safety Canada.
