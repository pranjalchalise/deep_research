      "snippet": "Ha Dong General Hospital, a level I hospital in Hanoi, with a capacity of 550 beds, including 33 departments and specialties, is responsible for the health care of people in the western part of Hanoi city. Following social development trends, the hospital always invests in quality improvement and advancement, including the “Safe injection” program launched by the Vietnam Nurses Association. To provide a description of the situation regarding injection safety in Ha Dong General Hospital, we have conducted a study with the following objectives: (1) Describing the status of injection safety in the hospital; (2) Describing the status of knowledge and injection safety practice of nurses working in the hospital; and (3) Identifying the factors related to nurses’ knowledge and safe injection [...] This research showed that on average each patient received 3.1 injections. Compared to the results study in other countries, this rate is lower than result study of HAURI Global 2000 study16. However, this result is higher than Tu’s study17,18 and research by the Vietnam Nurses Association in 201014,19,20. About 37.6% nurses had been injured by sharp objects. The sharp injury rate at Ha Dong Hospital is higher than the results of Muc’s study14, Nguyen Tu’s 2005 study17, and lower than that of the Vong et al’s study in Cambodia21. Most of the injuries occurred in the morning. Unintended activities is the cause of most injuries. Meanwhile, sharp instruments injuries accounted for most of the fingers wounds. [...] ## Methods\n\n### Study setting and design\n\nA cross-sectional study was conducted from February to August 2012 in Ha Dong General Hospital, Hanoi.\n\n### Sample and sampling method"
