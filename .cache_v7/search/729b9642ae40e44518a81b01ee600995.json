When he was in second grade his parents split up and he went to live with his mother. At age ten, he portrayed Dr. Martin Luther King in a play called \"A Night of Stars and Dreams\". That's when Lee decided he wanted to be an actor. After doing community theater for a while, he traveled to New York during the spring break of 1996 and got himself an agent. He moved to NY in June but it wasn't until next year that he got to audition for the part of Jett Jackson. Lee filmed the pilot. He found out in June 1998 from Disney that the show had been picked up.\n ### 10.

      "snippet": "In 2013, Lee began development on a film dramatising Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali's heavyweight title fight, known as the Thrilla in Manila. The film was to be produced by Universal with a screenplay written by Peter Morgan, but Lee later put it on hold in 2014 in order to make Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk \"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (film)\"). In December 2015, it was announced that the project, tentatively titled Thrilla in Manila, now with Studio 8 \"Studio 8 (company)\"), would be his next film after Gemini Man. David Oyelowo and Ray Fisher \"Ray Fisher (actor)\") were reportedly Lee's top choices for the leading roles of Frazier and Ali, respectively, and he hoped to film in 3D. Lee announced in November 2022 that he is working on a biopic on the life of Bruce Lee starring his [...] In 1995, Lee directed Columbia TriStar's British classic Sense and Sensibility \"Sense and Sensibility (1995 film)\") based on the Jane Austen novel of the same name. This made Lee a second-time winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and won Best Adapted Screenplay for screenwriter Emma Thompson, who also starred in the movie alongside Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Kate Winslet. Sense and Sensibility also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

He made The Ice Storm \"The Ice Storm (film)\") (1997), a drama set in 1970s suburban America, starring Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen, and Tobey Maguire. The film competed at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for the Palme d'Or. It received the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Screenplay. Angie Errigo of Empire \"Empire (magazine)\") praised the film writing, \"Lee seems incapable of making a less than outstanding movie\" adding, \"The real beauty of this film is the way in which Lee shifts his story from sex farce to youth drama to tragic despair with the help of a perfect ensemble cast\"."

Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, playing the wizard Saruman in The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and The Two Towers (2002). He reprised the role in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014), both based on an earlier Tolkien work. His looming presence caught the attention of director George Lucas, who cast him as Count Dooku in the Star Wars movies Attack of the Clones (2002) and Revenge of the Sith (2005).

In that film and its sequels, he exuded menace as the devious title character. Lee’s distinctive demeanour continued to secure him roles in such films as The Wicker Man (1973), in which he played a pagan priest; The Three Musketeers (1973) and its 1974 sequel, in which he took the part of Count Rochefort; and the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), in which he starred as Bond’s nemesis Scaramanga. Appearances in a steady series of unremarkable films were punctuated by a well-received turn as Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, in Jinnah (1998)."
