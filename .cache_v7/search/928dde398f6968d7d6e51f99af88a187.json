For much of this history it was reasonable to recast the goal of “creating” intelligence as that of “designing” intelligence. [...] doi:10.1016/j.artint.2006.10.009 1252 L. Spector / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 170 (2006) 1251–1253 Most AI texts nonetheless demonstrate, by their coverage, that their authors view AI as a set of design problems that human designers are expected to solve. Few describe evolutionary perspectives on the development of natural or artiﬁcial intelligence, and most describe existing evolutionary methods (usually just genetic algorithms) only as an odd form of search or learning.1 But these same texts are generally less committed to human design in their introductory deﬁnitions. For example Winston states that AI is “the study of ideas that enable computers to be intelligent” [13, p. 1], while Charniak and McDermott say that AI is “the study of mental faculties through the use of computational [...] 4 \nL. Spector / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 170 (2006) 1251–1253 1253 Whenever and wherever such integration occurs it may take a variety of forms. For example, future developers might use representations and algorithms that have been developed in mainstream AI as the ingredients in the “pri-mordial ooze” that is sampled and recombined by evolution. Alternatively, they might use human-designed algorithms to intelligently compose components that have been devised and reﬁned by evolutionary methods. Or they may com-bine design and evolution in ways that nobody has yet imagined."

[...] In this case the computer is used as a sensory tool in the virtual environment, however it isn’t an intelligent tool in that it doesn’t learn. Other examples of virtual environments are three-dimensional computer games, micro-surgery, and remote robotic control. Processing of sensory data is also used for autonomous vehicle navigation  and speech recognition . The virtual environments described above are used to present sensory data, though the interface is not used interactively to enhance a user’s skill level.\nThere are two notable examples where a computer does learn to perform skillfully. The first is Lee Spector’s GenBebop program  where a genetic algorithm is used to create improvisation based on a short underlying musical segment. [...] Though early Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers felt sensory-rich mundane tasks such as vision or locomotion would be easier to solve than “expert” tasks such as medical diagnosis, the opposite has proven to be true. We show how a computer system can be used as a tool to aid the user in both perceiving and performing a sensory-rich task, giving a non-expert an expert level of performance."
