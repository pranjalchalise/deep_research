      "snippet": "In accounting, amortization is a method of obtaining the expenses incurred by an intangible asset arising from a decline in value as a result of use or the passage of time. Amortization is the acquisition cost minus the residual value of an asset, calculated in a systematic manner over an asset's useful economic life. Depreciation is a corresponding concept for tangible assets.\n\nMethodologies for allocating amortization to each accounting period are generally the same as those for depreciation. However, many intangible assets such as goodwill \"Goodwill (accounting)\") or certain brands may be deemed to have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not subject to amortization (although goodwill is subjected to an impairment test every year). [...] While theoretically amortization is used to account for the decreasing value of an intangible asset over its useful life, in practice many companies will amortize what would otherwise be one-time expenses through listing them as a capital expense on the cash flow statement and paying off the cost through amortization, having the effect of improving the company's net income in the fiscal year or quarter of the expense.\n\nAmortization is recorded in the financial statements of an entity as a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset in the balance sheet and as an expense in the income statement.

Amortization impacts a company’s income statement and balance sheet, and has a unique set of rules for tax purposes. As the asset drops in value, it’s deducted as a non-cash expense, which reduces the company's overall tax burden. Businesses usually calculate amortization using the straight-line method. The formula divides the annual amortization expense by its estimated useful life. [...] tax liability an investment is not amortization works the same way allowing companies to steadily decrease the value of intangible assets typically over several years these incremental drops in value are then deducted as non-cash expenses which reduces the company's tax burden many examples of amortization in business relate to intellectual property such as patents and copyrights here's a typical situation for a patent company abz inc paid an outside inventor 180 thousand dollars for the exclusive rights to a solar panel she developed abz inc spent 20 thousand dollars to register the patent transferring the rights from the inventor for 20 years news of the sale caused two other inventors to challenge the application of the patent abz successfully defended the patent but incurred legal"

It\nspreads the asset’s value over periods that benefit from it in accordance with the matching\nprinciple, which requires expenses to be recognized in the same period as the revenue they\nhelped to generate instead of when they’re paid.\n\nIs amortization a liability or an expense?\n\nAmortization is a non-cash expense. It reduces the book value of an intangible asset over\ntime in line with the matching principle, but it doesn’t create a liability.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of amortization? [...] ## Amortization in Business Explained\n\nIn business, accountants define amortization as a process that systematically reduces the\nvalue of an intangible asset over its useful life. It’s an example of the matching\nprinciple, one of the basic tenets of GAAP. The matching principle requires expenses to be\nrecognized in the same period as the revenue they help generate, instead of when they’re\npaid.\n\nAmortization impacts a company’s income statement and balance sheet. It also has a unique set\nof rules for tax purposes and can significantly impact a company’s tax liability.\n\n## How Is Amortization Calculated? [...] Key Takeaways\n\n Amortization is the accounting process used to spread the cost of intangible assets over\n  the periods expected to benefit from their use.\n The customary method for amortization is the straight-line method.\n Determining which intangible assets may be amortized and the correct capitalized value\n  can sometimes be tricky.\n Amortization rules differ significantly for tax versus book purposes.\n Applied correctly, amortization can result in significant tax savings.\n\n## Amortization in Business Explained"

      "snippet": "Though you’ll have heard the word “amortization” at home and at work, you might have questions over its meaning. If we take the sentences “the car is now amortized” and “the loan amortization schedule will be five years”, they appear to point to different ideas.\n\nFirst, we should know that amortization refers to a reduction in value over time. While a car, computer or other asset will drop in worth as the years go by, the amount we owe on a loan, mortgage or other debt will fall as we make repayments. To understand what amortization means, we need to know whether we’re talking about an asset or a loan.\n\nWhat is amortization of an asset? [...] What is amortization of a loan?\n\nLoans can include consumer credit, a bank loan and a mortgage. Amortization in this case is the gradual reduction of the debt through the repayments we agree with the lender. Broadly speaking, loan amortization only considers the principal and doesn’t include interest.\n\nThese are the most common ways to calculate loan amortization: [...] What is amortization of an asset?\n\nAssets are items of property and resources we own that we expect will provide a benefit or return over a set period. A mobile phone, computer we use to study or work and the trainers we wear to go running are all assets we pay money for to fulfil a purpose.\n\nAll assets will lose their usefulness or benefit (i.e. their value) over their designated useful life. For instance, if we buy a EUR 1,000 television with a useful life of 10 years, we can say it will amortize after a decade, having served its purpose for its designated period. Its initial value will gradually drop while we enjoy using it."

Understanding these differences is critical when serving business clients.\n\nJump to ↓\n\n|  |\n\n| What is amortization in accounting? |\n\n|  |\n\n| What are the different amortization methods? |\n\n|  |\n\n| How to calculate amortization |\n\n|  |\n\n| Amortization vs. depreciation |\n\n|  |\n\n| Managing amortization of assets |\n\n## What is amortization in accounting?\n\nAmortization in accounting is a technique that is used to gradually write-down the cost of an intangible asset over its expected period of use or, in other words, useful life. This shifts the asset to the income statement from the balance sheet. [...] Example A: A business has a $10,000 software license, which it expects will come to an end in five years. Using the straight-line method, the amortization expense would be $2,000 per year for the next five years. At the end of five years, the carrying amount of the asset will be zero. The amortization period is the amount of time in which the company expects to generate revenue from the license.\n\n### Is amortization a liability or expense?\n\nAmortization is a non-cash expense. It is the concept of incrementally charging the cost (i.e., the expenditure required to acquire the asset) of an asset to expense over the asset’s useful life.\n\nSo how does this look? It reflects as a debit to the amortization expense account and a credit to the accumulated amortization account. [...] ### Is goodwill depreciated or amortized?\n\nGoodwill is amortized. Goodwill is defined as “The residual figure that is recorded on the balance sheet after subtracting the book value of a business from the higher price that was paid for it. Goodwill becomes impaired when its fair value declines below its carrying value.”\n\nGoodwill amortization is when the cost of the goodwill of the company is expensed over a specific period. Amortization is usually conducted on a straight-line basis over a 10-year period, as directed by the accounting standards."

This allows your business to get a more accurate view of its profitability. It also reduces taxable income by recording the expense gradually.\n\nTypically, the amortization of intangible assets follows a straight-line basis. This method expenses the same amount in each period over the asset’s useful life.

Asset amortization aims to accurately reflect a company’s financial position, especially when evaluating a merger or acquisition or applying for financing. Understanding this process can help your finance team get a more realistic view of an asset’s value over time. Here’s how asset amortization works, how it differs from depreciation, and some moments in your business life cycle when it makes sense to calculate this indicator.\n\nRead more: [What Is Your Business Worth?

Alternatively, depreciation is recorded by crediting an account called accumulated depreciation, a contra asset account,” wrote Investopedia. “The historical cost of fixed assets remains on a company's books; however, the company also reports this contra asset amount as a net reduced book value amount.”\n\nRead more: [Accounting vs. Financial Planning: Explained]\n\n## Why is amortization important for small businesses?"
