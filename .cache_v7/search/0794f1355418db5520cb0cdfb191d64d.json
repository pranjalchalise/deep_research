      "snippet": "In fall 1820, Pierce entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, one of 19 freshmen. He joined the Athenian Society, a progressive literary society, alongside Jonathan Cilley (later elected to Congress) and Nathaniel Hawthorne, with whom he formed lasting friendships. He was the last in his class after two years, but he worked hard to improve his grades and graduated in fifth place in 1824 in a graduating class of 14. John P. Hale enrolled at Bowdoin in Pierce's junior year; he became a political ally of Pierce's and then his rival. Pierce organized and led an unofficial militia company called the Bowdoin Cadets during his junior year, which included Cilley and Hawthorne. The unit performed drill on campus near the president's house, until the noise caused him to demand that it halt. The [...] Pierce's father placed Pierce in a school at Hillsborough Center in childhood and sent him to the town school in Hancock at age 12. Not fond of schooling, Pierce grew homesick and walked 12 miles (19 km) back to his home one Sunday. His father fed him dinner and drove him part of the distance back to school before ordering him to walk the rest of the way in a thunderstorm. Pierce later cited this moment as \"the turning-point in my life\". Later that year, he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy to prepare for college. By this time, he had built a reputation as a charming student, sometimes prone to misbehavior. [...] The Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire, was chartered in 1962.\n The University of New Hampshire School of Law was founded in 1973 as the Franklin Pierce Law Center. When the school was renamed in 2010, a Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property was established.\n There is a Mt. Pierce in the Presidential Range of New Hampshire's White Mountains \"White Mountains (New Hampshire)\"), renamed from Mt. Clinton in 1913.\n The small town of Pierceton, Indiana, was founded in the 1850s and honors President Pierce.\n Pierce County, Washington, the second most populous county in the state, is named in honor of President Pierce.\n Pierce County, Georgia, established in 1857, is also named in honor of President Pierce.\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]"

He also served as a volunteer general in the Mexican-American War, where he had passed out in battle (albeit from a knee injury) and gained the nickname “Fainting Frank.”\n\nPierce was able to grab the nomination as a compromise candidate who was seen as a pro-slavery Northerner. That appealed to a Democratic party that had endorsed the Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act. Pierce defeated his former commander, General Winfield Scott, in the 1852 election, thanks to Scott’s weakness as a campaigner and the overall decline of the Whig Party in national politics.\n\nAt his inauguration, President Pierce made it clear where he stood on the issues of slavery, states and the Constitution.
