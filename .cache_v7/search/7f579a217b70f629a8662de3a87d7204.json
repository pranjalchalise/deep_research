It’s a reminder that leadership isn’t always about doing everything, but about setting vision, connecting the dots, and building the environment where innovation thrives. My take: AI is accelerating what we used to do manually. That’s powerful, but it also means we need to double down on teaching future generations how to think critically, ask better questions, and solve problems creatively—faster than we did, not just rely on machines to do it all.
