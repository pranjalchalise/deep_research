      "snippet": "Peirce’s Concept of Information Alexandre Augusto Ferraz (UNICAMP – BRAZIL) alexfferraz@uol.com.br Introduction Peirce’s theory of information provides foundations for our main PhD thesis hypothesis and this is why such concept is one of most important to us in all his philosophical system. To understand this part of Peirce’s work it is necessary to understand his three conceptions of information. The first conceives information in a traditional sense as a logical quantity calculated from the quantities of extension and comprehension. The second deals with information in a broader sense, considering the semeiotic and pragmatic aspects (not only verbal symbols, but also iconic and indexical signs and non-verbal symbols). The third takes a metaphysical approach, dealing with information as [...] in his theory of information. This more general theory applies to signs in general and not only to verbal symbols. There is here a great increase of Peirce’s conception of information. In his semeiotic, information is a synthesis between index and icon. The former is “[…] a sign which refers to the Object that it denotes merely by virtue of characters of its own, and which it possesses, just the same, whether any such Object actually exists or not. It is true that unless there really is such an Object, the Icon does not act as a sign; but this has nothing to do with its character as a sign. Anything whatever, be it quality, existent individual, or law, is an Icon of anything, in so far as it is like that thing and used as a sign of it” (CP 2.247). The latter is “[…] a sign which refers to [...] takes a metaphysical approach, dealing with information as the imparting of form to matter. In this text, we intend to summarize this concept, showing that all these aspects are linked amongst them. As stated by De Tienne (2006), “Peirce’s pragmatistic theory of information is indissolubly connected to his semiotic theory of propositions, itself an elaborate outgrowth of the traditional subject-predicate propositional logic and of the logic of relatives”. We argue that the third part of this theory is also indissolubly linked to the other two, since an object of representation transmits its respective forms to the sign that represents it for an interpretant determined by the sign. Information gives a form in the sense that to know an object we must represent it, sorting out the form from"

      "snippet": "Within his larger philosophical system, Peirce’s semiotics derives from his phenomenology (philosophy of things we experience). He was the first to develop a philosophical theory of phenomenology, which he called phaneroscopy from φανερός, what is visible or manifest. Husserl developed his own theory of phenomenology, and ironically became better-known for this than Peirce did, though Peirce’s theory of experiencing objects is arguably superior. [...] When people discuss the connections between language and cognition such as the possible existence of language in nonhuman species, communication in nature, language acquisition, thinking and human language more generally, cognitive scientists and evolutionary anthropologists usually appeal to concepts such as symbol and sign. A couple of decades after Peirce’s semiotics, Saussure invented his own theory of signs that he also called semiotics though unfortunately with little understanding of Peirce’s work. (Both Peirce and Saussure borrowed the name and interest in semiotics from the 17th-century philosopher John Locke; the term derives from the Greek word σημεῖον, or semeion, for ‘sign’, ‘miracle’, etc.) [...] Peirce’s theory of signs recognises three foundational types of signs and three components to each of these signs. A Peircean sign requires a signalling form to link an object with an interpretation. Smoke is a sign of fire when a mind links the smoke (the form) with the interpretation that the form indicates: fire (the object). Peirce argued for three foundational signs: icons, indexes and symbols. An icon is a sign that is structurally isomorphic in some way (eg, physically resembling its object); an index is a sign that is (loosely) physically connected to its object, such as smoke connected to fire; smell connected to onions; or pointing physically towards an object. Finally, a symbol is almost always a cultural convention that all objects of a cultural type (an individual instance of"

      "snippet": "on the other hand, is the habit of interpretation or the habit of action which interpretation of the sign 88 engenders (CP 5.491, 5.486): \"the deliberately formed, self-analyzing habit . . . is the living definition, the veritable and final logical interpretant\" (CP 5.491). Thus, according to Peirce, the most perfect account of a concept, or any sign, consists \"in a description of the habit which the concept is calculated to produce'' (CP 5.491), which, of course, is the essence of the pragmatic maxim: \"consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object\" (CP 5.402). [...] as theoretical sciences, for reasons that will become clearer as we proceed. The science of review is a rather odd category. Peirce claims that it is both a theoretical and a practical science (CP 1.202), and not much else is said about it. It is \"the business of those who occupy themselves with arranging the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science.... The classification of the sciences belongs to this department'' (CP 1.182). [...] 19 The theoretical sciences are the focus of his work in this regard. Peirce considers a number of sensible frameworks to subdivide the sciences of discoveryfor example, in terms of the sort of problem they address (CP 1.227), the kinds of questions they are concerned with (CP 1.184), the technique of reasoning employed (CP 2.644)but he divides them further 20 Page 4 Figure 1.
