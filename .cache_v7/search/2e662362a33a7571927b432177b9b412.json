Various technologies have had occupational impacts throughout recent history, but many affected occupations have still seen employment growth. Although it is always possible that [...] in the occupation would decline 23.6 percent from 2004 to 2014. Indeed, employment in the occupation started to fall precipitously in the early 2000s, declining from a peak of 86,300 in 2004 to 28,800 in 2014, with a further decline to only 9,200 in 2023.7 [...] Growth trends for selected occupations considered at risk from automation, _Monthly Labor Review_, July 2022.\n\nRelated Subjects\n\n   Computers\n   Employment\n   Industry and Occupational studies\n   Jobs\n   Occupations\n   Projections\n   Statistical programs and methods\n   Technological change\n   Technology\n\nArticle Citations\n\nCrossref0\n\nBarriers to AI Inputs: Implications for Competition and Innovation, _Management and Business Review_, 2025.\n\ntop Back to Top\n\nArticle\n\nFebruary 2025\nIncorporating AI impacts in BLS employment projections: occupational case studies"

The impact of AI on employment is not evenly distributed across industries or skill levels. A study by McKinsey Global Institute suggests that AI could automate up to 30% of hours currently worked across the U.S. economy by 2030.10 While some sectors may see minimal disruption or even job growth, others may experience significant job displacement.11 7 “The Impact of AI on the Labour Market.” 8 Sudeep Srivastava, “AI in Manufacturing: Use Cases and Examples,” Appinventiv (blog), July 24, 2023,  9 Beatrice Nolan, “AI Systems like ChatGPT Could Impact 300 Million Full-Time Jobs Worldwide, with [...] capital development will be better positioned for long-term competitiveness in the evolving labor market.

      "snippet": "Multiple forces are set to fuel growth in certain occupations and erode jobs in others. They generally fall into three categories: automation, including generative AI; an injection of federal investment into infrastructure and the net-zero transition; and long-term structural trends such as aging, continuing investment in technology, and the growth of e-commerce and remote work. We do not forecast how aggregated employment may be affected by the business cycle in the short term; instead, we focus on how these forces may reshape the composition of labor demand over the long term. [...] Total employment hit an all-time high after the pandemic, with many employers encountering hiring difficulties. As of April 2023, some ten million positions remained vacant; labor force participation had ticked up but was 0.7 percentage point below its prepandemic level. That translates into roughly 1.9 million workers who are neither employed nor actively looking for jobs. This erosion comes after an extended 20-year trend of steadily falling participation. [...] During the pandemic (2019–22), the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational shifts, 50 percent more than in the previous three-year period. Most involved people leaving food services, in-person sales, and office support for different occupations.\n By 2030, activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated—a trend accelerated by generative AI. However, we see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright. Automation’s biggest effects are likely to hit other job categories. Office support, customer service, and food service employment could continue to decline."

      "snippet": "To this end, the economics team compared changes in employment trends with AI exposure across industries, as well as within detailed subsectors of professional employment, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) and Anthropic AI. On the whole, there is a mildly negative correlation between employment trends and AI usage, suggesting that AI may be depressing job growth. [...] For starters, the unemployment rate among college graduates has increased, reaching 5.8% in March — the highest in more than four years. “Disturbingly, the unemployment rate has been trending above the aggregate rate, which is highly unusual by historical standards,” noted Murat Tasci, senior U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan. While the trend could be partially due to a secular rise in the relative supply of college graduates and unusually low labor market churn, the effects of AI could also be at play. [...] ## Key takeaways\n\n The unemployment rate among college graduates has risen, with majors exposed to AI, including computer engineering design and architecture, among those affected.\n In addition, job growth across several white-collar sectors has been tepid, pointing to AI’s growing role in the workforce.\n Certain tech industries, including cloud, web search and computer systems design, stopped growing at the end of 2022, just after the release of ChatGPT.\n\nGenerative AI is experiencing rapid uptake across various sectors, with potentially profound impacts on job growth. Indeed, there are signs that the technology is already displacing roles in certain industries."

      "snippet": "Even workers in high-wage roles heavily exposed to AI — positions near the top of the pay scale — saw their share of total employment grow by about 3% over five years. That’s because AI boosted firm productivity: Companies that used the technology grew faster, which helped sustain or even expand head count in high-exposure positions.\n\nThe takeaway for employers rolling the technology out to their workforce: “Firms that adopt AI don’t necessarily need to shed workers; they can grow and make more stuff and use workers more efficiently than other firms,” said Schmidt, an economist who studies how finance and the job market intersect. [...] Top-paying roles(like management analysts, aerospace engineers, and computer and information research scientists): Employment within firms fell by about 3.5% over five years. These more lucrative roles are more likely to be in firms that adopt AI; the productivity gains that those firms realize more than offset the losses. As a result, the highest-paid jobs still make up a slightly bigger share of employment than those less exposed to AI. [...] What happened to jobs — and why\n\nAs of December 2023, AI had not caused major changes in total employment. Losses in highly exposed roles were largely offset by gains in other jobs — and by hiring growth at firms that used AI to become more productive. But the findings predate the widespread rise of generative AI, which the authors note could shift such patterns in the future.\n\nThe study also shows that companies can see substantial gains by putting AI to work — and that that growth translates into jobs. Firms that use AI extensively tend to be larger and more productive, and pay higher wages. They also grow faster: A large increase in AI use is linked to about 6% higher employment growth and 9.5% more sales growth over five years.\n\nWhich jobs shrank — and which grew"

      "snippet": "Additionally, the technology is so new that longer-term effects remain unknown. If generative AI drives sustained productivity growth, it could ultimately create new jobs and industries, potentially offsetting displacement effects. As AI capabilities continue advancing rapidly, monitoring these employment patterns becomes increasingly critical.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe data raise important questions about our economic transition into the AI era. If current trends continue, new approaches to workforce development, social safety nets and economic support for displaced workers may merit greater consideration. As we navigate this technological revolution, understanding potential early warning signs could prove crucial for protecting U.S. workers and maintaining economic stability.\n\nNotes"
