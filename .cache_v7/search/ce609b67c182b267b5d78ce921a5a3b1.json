      "snippet": "The risk assessment method assigns qualitative estimates of likelihood and impact to public health threats, together with associated uncertainties. These estimates are derived through an integration of rapid review of the literature and expert opinion using standardized scales. The methodology used by PHAC has been adapted from the Joint Risk Assessment Operational Tool to assess the risk posed by zoonotic disease hazards developed jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH).Footnote 1 PHAC adapted the tool by modifying the likelihood and impact scales and associated definitions to incorporate elements from other risk assessment frameworks that are relevant to the Canadian [...] scenario(s) and resultant impacts. Each step in the risk pathway is associated with a likelihood or impact sub-question that is addressed as part of the risk assessment. For example, a risk pathway developed for the importation of measles into Canada (Figure 3) shows the measles introduction in Canada, transmission in the population and the resultant health impacts.

A risk assessment is a systematic process of gathering, assessing and documenting information to estimate the level of risk and associated uncertainty related to a public health event, during a specified period of time and in a specified location.Footnote 1"

At home, floods, hurricanes, cyber attacks and forms of ideological radicalization are all recent threats and hazards that the Government of Canada (GC), often in collaboration with the provinces and territories, has taken a role in managing. Threats and hazards vary in their likelihood and impact; an effective approach to managing them requires that the GC identify their risk. Increasingly, domestic governments and international organizations recognize that understanding risks through identifying, assessing and monitoring them is a key step to build the foundation for effective emergency management (EM) planning and a country’s resilience. The Government of Canada [...] is a key component of the risk assessment process. Risk identification is the process of finding, recognizing and recording risks. The objective of risk identification for the purpose of the AHRA is to identify key risks that have significant impact on Canada and/or Canadians, including Canadian federal institutions. Furthermore, the process assists each federal government institution in confirming risks according to its mandate and responsibilities and in developing plans or preparations necessary to reduce, mitigate or prevent these risks.  INPUTS REQUIRED The following information input will help in identifying risks:  Analysis of short-term (within the next 5 years) threats and hazards.  Analysis of emerging and future (in 5 to 25 years) threats/hazards.  Risk themes. These inputs"

      "snippet": "## 5. Audit conclusion\n\nThe CFIA-developed Establishment-based Risk Assessment (ERA) model is a key risk modeling tool used by the Agency to evaluate domestic food establishments based on the risk they represent to Canadian consumers. The ERA model uses data related to the inherent risks of an establishment based on the type and volume of the products manufactured, along with the preventive controls in place, and compliance with the regulations. Performance of the ERA model depends on its governance and the quality of industry and Agency data. [...] The ERA model evaluates food safety risk of individual establishments subject to the SFCA/R based on their potential impact on consumer health in Canada. The model assesses risk using scientific data, establishment-specific information gathered from regulated parties and an establishment's compliance history. This impact is based on an establishment's activities and production volume. It is measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), a widely recognized measurement commonly used by science researchers and policymakers to estimate and compare the burden of disease. The DALYs are calculated for each of the 18 pathogens that cause over 99% of the microbial food-borne disease burden in Canada. The health impact of each pathogen takes into consideration the number of annual food-borne [...] ## 7.
