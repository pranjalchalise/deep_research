      "snippet": "same quality of life that her generation has enjoyed. That was her intention when she went to law school in the early 1970’s. [...] In June 2007, she made an additional $10 million investment in ASU to recruit four of the world’s leading sustainability scholar-researchers to fill four professorships focused on renewable energy systems, sustainable business practices, global environmental change and complex systems dynamics (which involves the conceptual modeling of human-environmental interactions). [...] “I thought I would go into the corporate world and help corporations understand their responsibility for the environment,” she says. “But in 1975, there was no such thing. Corporate responsibility for the environment developed years later.” Today, as a successful businesswoman and philanthropist, she has found a way to give back—or, more accurately, to invest in the future. She believes that a confluence of factors will cause her investments to pay huge dividends In 2004, Wrigley made a $15 million investment in Arizona State University to establish the University’s Global Institute of Sustainability. From that Institute grew the world’s first School of Sustainability, which opened at ASU in January 2007."
