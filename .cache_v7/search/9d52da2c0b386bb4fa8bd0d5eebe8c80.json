      "snippet": "Loring Brace is a leading scholar in biological anthropology, with research interests spanning from our species’ earliest evolution through modern scientific understandings of race. Throughout his distinguished career, Brace has been a consistent advocate for the application of a Darwinian perspective to major questions in biological anthropology, a perspective made manifest in more than 190 academic publications. Loring’s early work explored the number of species of early humans in the fossil record, and has championed the view that the Neanderthals are ancestral to modern humans. He pioneered the use of quantitative metric data to investigate human evolutionary relationships, with a particular interest in understanding how changes in culture have affected human anatomy over the past two [...] in culture have affected human anatomy over the past two million years. He has explored these questions through research on museum specimens in Europe, China, Japan, Indonesia, and the United States. Professor Brace has been a strong and important voice in critiquing and challenging simplistic biological notions of race, most recently in his 2005 book Race is a Four-Letter Word (Oxford University Press). These and other accomplishments were honored in 2006 when the American Association of Physical Anthropologists presented Professor Brace with its prestigious Charles Darwin lifetime achievement award.

      "snippet": "Brace was born in 1826 in Litchfield, Connecticut, the second child of John Brace and Lucy Porter. John had moved to Litchfield to assist his aunt, Sara Pierce, founder of one of the first schools in the United States to extend secondary education to women. His students included Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), and her sister Catharine Beecher, whose books defined women's new domestic roles. [...] At Yale and the Yale Divinity School, Brace developed liberal religious and political views, questioning the idea of original sin, applauding the 1848 European revolutions, and opposing slavery. At 19, he decided to enter the ministry. Continuing his studies, Brace [Page 42]moved to New York to attend the Union Theological Seminary and began his work with the poor in the penitentiary, charity hospital, and almshouse on Blackwell's Island. As a young theological student, he wondered at the crowded streets of New York City. Nothing in his experience growing up in bucolic Hartford had prepared him for the noise, filth, and confusion of the immigrant-filled Five Points slum. He took every opportunity to escape to his friend and schoolmate Frederick Law Olmsted's farm on Staten Island. With [...] or log into your member profile to access the email feature."

Brace served as an enslaved sailor-soldier aboard Mills’ vessel during in the Seven Years War, also known as The French and Indian War. He received five wounds in a battle with a Spanish ship during the fight for control of Havana, Cuba.\n\nAfter the war, he was sold by Captain Mills to a John Burwell of Milford, Connecticut, the first of a series of cruel owners who subjected him to beatings and other humiliations. Fortunately, he eventually became a servant to widow, Mary Stiles who treated him kindly and taught him to read, write and speak proper English. [...] After the Revolutionary war broke out, Jeffrey Brace enlisted and served three terms and suffered a leg wound. When the war ended in 1783, he returned to Milford and eventually was granted his freedom by Benjamin Stiles, Mary’s son. [...] Finally, the Braces decided to leave Poultney and move to Sheldon, Vermont, and from there to Georgia, Vermont. Brace lived to be  approximately 85 years old and became blind in his later years. In 1810 he told the story of his life to Benjamin F. Prentiss who published his memoirs under the title The Blind African Slave or the Memoirs of Boyrereau Brinch Nicknamed Jeffrey Brace. This memoir attests to the remarkable memory, intelligence, and strength of character of the first black settler of Poultney. It is fitting that the University of Vermont’s faculty union awards book scholarships in Brace’s name annually to students who “exemplify not only academic excellence but also an active commitment to achieving social justice.” Copies of “The Blind African Slave” can be purchased from the"

Brace traveled with friends through Europe learning about correctional and philanthropic institution, primarily in Germany and Great Britain. While touring, he met Letitia Neill and in 1854 he returned to Belfast, Ireland to marry her. Also while touring, Reverend Brace began to realize he had more of a calling toward missionary work than to church ministry in a parish or congregation. Returning to the United States, Brace took a position as assistant to the Rev. Lewis M. Pease a Methodist minister directing the Five Points Mission, located in one of the poorest neighborhoods of New York City. He began to dabble in journalism, creating a regular column for the New York Times, entitled, “Walks Among the New-York Poor,” which provided [...] ### Introduction\n\nCharles Loring Brace was born into a well-connected New England family. At the time of his birth, his father, John Brace, was principal of Litchfield Academy; and in 1832 the family moved to Hartford, CT where John Brace directed a female seminary. John later became editor of the Harford Courant. Young Brace was home-schooled by his father until 1842 when he entered Yale University. Following graduation in 1846, Brace taught for a year before enrolling in the Yale Divinity School, and additional studies at the Union Theological Seminary in New York City.
