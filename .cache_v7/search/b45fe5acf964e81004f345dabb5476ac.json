Today we're releasing our first ambient agent of the week - an executive AI email assistant. This agent is built on top of a pattern we believe will be widely adopted throughout the agents released this year, and in years to come. Ambient agents are AI applications which can suggest actions to the user, then await your approval, feedback, or edits before executing the action. This pattern enables whole hosts of agent applications which would not have been fully trusted by users before, like an email assistant. Check out the free hosted executive AI email assistant here:  And the open source code here: \n\n122   6 Comments\n\nLike   Comment\n\nIoannis Bakagiannis   11mo \n\n Report this comment"
