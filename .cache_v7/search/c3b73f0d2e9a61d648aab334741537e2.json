      "snippet": "While in Virginia between 1607-1609, Smith established relations with numerous Tidewater tribes and even a few tribes based in the Piedmont. He was an effective diplomat with both the Algonquians who owed allegiance to Powhatan, and with tribes who spoke Siouan dialects and were enemies of the 30+ tribes controlled by Powhatan. Smith negotiated the exchange with those tribes of prestige goods/tools/weapons for food. In Jamestown, he provided enough discipline (as well as food) to keep many of the colonists alive.

Smith used a specific symbol to show the locations of the key towns with \"werowances,\" or chiefs with the power to assemble warriors.\n\nBased on Smith's map, we know that Parahunt (a brother of Powhatan) occupied the town of Powhatan at the falls of the James River. That site, the birthplace of Powhatan, is now Tree Hill farm."

      "snippet": "Smith became the president of the council at Jamestown in the fall of 1608. He established trading relations with several Indigenous leaders and put the settlers to work by enforcing his unpopular rule that \"he that will not worke shall not eate.\" While Smith was able to improve conditions, the colonists failed to produce enough food and they were dependent on trade with the nearby Powhatan people. Smith was forced to travel back to England in 1609 after a stray match lit his powder bag and set his clothing aflame, resulting in severe burns. Smith published his Generall Historie of Virginia in 1624, and it remains an important source for those studying this period of American history. [...] After reaching the Chesapeake Bay in 1607, Smith served as one of the governing councilors for the new colony. The first few months of the colony's existence were extremely difficult, and many of Smith's companions died of illness or in battles with Indigenous residents.\n\nLate in 1607, Smith was captured by the brother of the Powhatan chief. Smith later recorded that he had been rescued from certain death by Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas, but the accuracy of this account is debated. The event is sometimes interpreted as a ritual ceremony of execution and rescue that served to symbolically make Smith and the English subordinate to Powhatan. [...] ### Suggested Questions\n\nPreview Activity  \n  \nLook at It: Look closely at the bust of John Smith. From the position of the head and the facial expression, what might you be able to conclude about John Smith the man? How might this be a reflection more of twentieth-century people's ideas about the colonists than about the historical figure of John Smith? Explain why.   \n  \nPost Activities  \n  \nAnalyze: If John Smith had been executed as planned in 1607, how might that have changed the outcome of the Jamestown settlement? What role did he play in its survival?  \n  \nBe a Journalist: Imagine that you can go back in time and interview the colonists or Powhatan people. What questions would you ask? What information would you hope to get from their responses?"

Part of this leadership involved exploring the area and establishing trade with local people. Unfortunately for the Native Americans, Smith believed that the English should treat them as the Spanish had: to compel them to \"drudgery, work, and slavery,\" so English colonists could live \"like Soldiers upon the fruit of their labor.\" Thus, when his negotiations for food occasionally failed, Smith took what he wanted by force. [...] For additional documents related to these topics, it is probably best to focus on John Smith's Generall Historie of Virginia and Peter Force's collection of tracts. Both these items are in The Capital and the Bay. Another good source of information is the Records of the Virginia Company, in the Thomas Jefferson Papers.

      "snippet": "Although Smith provided no detail of his time with the Indians of the Nanticoke River, the detail of his map, including the upper reaches beyond where the English visited personally, imply a good deal of interaction with the Natives. Most likely he visited with the Indian leader at his town also noted by the name of Kaskarawaok, which was located north of present-day Vienna, on Chicone Creek.\n\nrecreation of John Smith's Shallop - photo courtesy of Wicomico County Tourism\n\nrecreation of John Smith's Shallop - photo courtesy of Wicomico County Tourism [...] John Smith Shallop\n\nThe objectives of these voyages included exploring the Chesapeake to find a route to the Pacific, finding ores suitable for mining, trading with and noting locations and populations of the Indian nations, learning more about the region from the Natives, mapping the area, and claiming new territory for England. Smith’s subsequent publication of a map of his voyages opened the Chesapeake Bay to European settlers, altering forever the face of the Bay and profoundly changing the lives of those around it. The surprisingly accurate map, incorporating the accounts of Chesapeake Bay Indians, and produced through Smith’s nautical and cartographic skills, was used for 100 years after it was made. [...] the English found an unoccupied Indian camp and left trade goods there. The next day, Smith was able to befriend four Indians who had been away fishing and did not know of the previous encounters. With the help of these four men, he was able to meet the local Indians in trade, reporting later that they had high quality furs."

      "snippet": "In December 1607, Native Americans led by Opechancanough captured Smith while he was seeking food along the Chickahominy River, and he was taken to meet Chief Powhatan \"Powhatan (Native American leader)\"), Opechancanough's older brother, at Werowocomoco, the main village of the Powhatan Confederacy. The village was on the north shore of the York River \"York River (Virginia)\") about 15 miles (24 km) north of Jamestown and 25 miles (40 km) downstream from where the river forms from the Pamunkey River and the Mattaponi River at West Point, Virginia. [...] After that, Smith tried to obtain food from the local Natives, but it required threats of military force for them to comply. Smith discovered that there were those among both the settlers and the Natives who were planning to take his life, and he was warned about the plan by Pocahontas. He called a meeting and threatened those who were not working \"that he that will not work shall not eat.\" After that, the situation improved and the settlers worked with more industry.\n\n### Encounter with Powhatan tribe\n\n[edit&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Encounter with Powhatan tribe\")] [...] Smith compared his experiences in Virginia with his observations of New England and offered a theory of why some English colonial projects had failed. He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control. The people inhabiting the coasts from Maine to Cape Cod had \"large corne fields, and great troupes of well proportioned people\", but the French had obtained everything that they had to offer in trade within six weeks. This was due to the fact that the French had created a great trading network which they could exploit, and the English had not cultivated these relations. Where once there was inter-tribal warfare, the French had created peace in the name of the fur trade. Former enemies such as the Massachuset and"
