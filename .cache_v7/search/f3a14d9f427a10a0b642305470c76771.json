      "snippet": "## Practice time!\n\nLet’s dive into the specifics by implementing our own versions of `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.\n\n## Recreating `useState`\n\nThe `useState` hook lets us create a piece of state that persists between renders. The challenge is to retain the state across re-renders while maintaining its isolation for each component.\n\nHere’s how React does it under the hood:\n\n1. React keeps an array of hook states for each component instance.\n2. When `useState` is called, React adds a new item to this array if it’s the first render or accesses the existing state on subsequent renders.\n\n### Simplified Implementation of `useState` [...] ### Logic During Rendering\n\nWhen React calls the `App` component, each hook is processed sequentially. React either retrieves an existing value from `hookStates` or writes a new one.\n\nInitial Render:\n\n A new value is added to `hookStates` for each hook.\n\nRe-render:\n\n `useState`: uses the value at index `0` for `count` and saves any updates after a state change.\n `useEffect`: checks dependencies at index `1`, and if they have changed, it runs `cleanupFn` and applies a new effect.\n `useRef`: returns the object at index `2`, preserving the same `current` value across renders.\n\nThis approach ensures React can correctly manage data for each hook by relying on the consistent order of hook calls in the component function.\n\n## Practice time! [...] ```\nComponent: App----------------| hookStates || [ || 0: { current: 0 }, // useState (count)| 1: { current: [cleanupFunction, [count]] }, // useEffect| 2: { current: 0 } // useRef| ] |----------------\n```\n\n## How Hooks Are Added and Updated\n\nInitial Render:\n\n React creates an array called `hookStates` to hold all hooks used in the component.\n Each time `useState`, `useEffect`, or `useRef` is called, a new object is added to `hookStates` to store data for that hook.\n Index (in this case `hookIndex`) is used to track the position of each hook in the array, so the correct data can be added and accessed for each hook.\n\nSubsequent Renders:"

The `set` function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.\n\n#### Caveats [...] ## Usage\n\n### Adding state to a component\n\nCall `useState` at the top level of your component to declare one or more state variables.\n\n```\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\nconst [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\nconst [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n// ...\n\n```\n\nThe convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]` using array destructuring.\n\n`useState` returns an array with exactly two items:\n\n1. The current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.\n2. The `set` function that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.\n\nTo update what’s on the screen, call the `set` function with some next state:\n\n```\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\nsetName('Robin');\n\n}\n\n``` [...] API Reference\n\nHooks\n\n# useState\n\n`useState` is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.\n\n```\n\nconst [state, setState] = useState(initialState)\n\n```"

Provides us with a setter function to update the state variable and hence trigger a re-render of our component.\n\nWe can import the useState hook from react. The useState() hook takes in the initial value of the state variable as an argument and provides us with the state variable and the setter function. The variable could be of any data type, such as string, number, object, array, and more.\n\nFor Example:\n\n```\n\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n\nconst [number, setNumber] = useState(1);\n\nconst [string, setString] = useState('John Doe')\n\nconst [object, setObject] = useState({name: 'johndoe'}) [...] 🚀 Visual editing now available!Introducing Click to Edit\n\n Frontend\n React\n\n# useState() Hook in React - A Complete Guide\n\nLearn everything you need to know about the useState() hook, how it works, and some rules that guide how it works alongside examples for better understanding.\n\nLast updated byAagam\n\non Sep 23, 2024\n\nOriginally written by Joel\n\nReact is a free, open-source JavaScript frontend library that we can use to build frontend applications. Before React v16.8 in 2019, developers always used class components for data management (with states) and other operations like lifecycle methods, and functional components were only to be used for rendering UI. [...] Since the introduction of React Hooks in React v16.8, we can manage data via states in functional components and work with lifecycle methods. Over time, class components were outdated and deprecated in React. Functional components along with Hooks are the new standard way to write React components.\n\n## #State in React\n\nWhenever an interaction happens, react components often need to change and show the latest data after an interaction. For instance, typing in a form should update the input field with whatever the user typed, clicking “next page” should change the page content, and clicking “Add contact” should add the new contact to the existing contact list."

      "snippet": "1. Dynamic UI Updates: State allows React to monitor and re-render components and update the UI based on changes in data or user interactions.\n2. User Input Handling: State is often used to manage user input, such as form data. When users interact with an application, the state can capture and reflect the current input values.\n3. Component Communication: Parent components can pass down state as props to child components, enabling data flow and communication between components and synchronization.\n4. Asynchronous Operations: State is essential for handling asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API. It helps to manage loading states, error states, and the display of fetched data. [...] In this example, we initialize the `name` state variable with an empty string, `\"\"` , and monitor input changes using the event handler, `onChange`. Once a user updates the text in the input element, the setter function, `setName`, is run and the argument passed into it, i.e. the current value in the input element, `e.target.value`, is stored in the `name` state. Once the state has been updated, React re-renders the component and updates the UI, letting us display the updated name.\n\nYou can also pass a function instead of a variable as the initial value. This function is called the initializer function and it runs only once, at the first render of that component. It should be pure and and should return a value, which is used to initialize the variable. [...] In this example, we have been able to show the power of useState as stated at the beginning of the article. We handled user input by monitoring changes and storing them in the email and password states, conditionally rendered UI (notification messages) and dynamically updated the UI with a message based on the `success` and `error` states, and handled updated states asynchronously.\n\nTypically, the `handleSubmit()` function makes an asynchronous POST API request to a server which is either successful or not depending on if the user submitted the right data. We can update the success and error states based on the server response."
