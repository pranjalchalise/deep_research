      "snippet": "That would seemingly put a big dent in the feasibility of so-called AI agents, which are models designed to autonomously carry out tasks without human intervention, and which the industry universally decided last year would be its next big thing. Some companies that embraced AI agents to downsize their workforces quickly realized that the agents they weren’t anywhere near good enough to replace the outgoing humans, perhaps because they hallucinated so much and could barely complete any of the tasks given to them. [...] Double Agent\n\n# AI Agents Are Mathematically Incapable of Doing Functional Work, Paper Finds\n\n\"There is no way they can be reliable.\"\n\nBy Frank Landymore\n\nPublished\n\nA months-old but until now overlooked study recently featured in Wired claims to mathematically prove that large language models “are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity” — that level of complexity being, crucially, pretty low. [...] Ignore the rhetoric that tech CEOs spew onstage and pay attention to what the researchers that work for them are finding, and you’ll find that even the AI industry agrees that the tech has some fundamental limitations baked into its architecture. In September, for example, OpenAI scientists admitted that AI hallucinations, in which LLMs confidently make up facts, were still a pervasive problem even in increasingly advanced systems, and that model accuracy would “never” reach 100 percent."

      "snippet": "2.  High-fidelity interaction with agile responses\n\nHigh-fidelity modeling of road users is widely regarded as one of the most challenging problems for autonomous driving simulation. The key difficulty lies in moving beyond representing an \"average\" road user to accurately capture unpredictable behaviors in the real world – for example, a human driver abruptly cutting into the lane of an AV.\n\nTo address this, WeRide GENESIS introduced the AI Agents  module, which builds intelligent behavior models  for human drivers, pedestrians, riders, and other road users. These models realistically simulate the full spectrum of traffic behaviors, from routine driving to high-risk actions. [...] Such simulation platforms allow AVs to \"drive\" in virtual cities, exposing AI drivers to diverse road, weather, and traffic scenarios – including rare and high-risk events. This overcomes the cost and coverage constraints of real-world testing, improves training efficiency, and ensures AVs are safer and more reliable on real roads.\n\nAs one of the industry's most advanced autonomous driving simulation platforms, WeRide GENESIS integrates four core AI modules  – AI Scenarios, AI Agents, AI Metrics, and AI Diagnosis  – to handle any driving scenario, create virtual worlds in minutes, and replicate real-world conditions with centimeter-level fidelity. This provides powerful support for the training, validation, and iteration of autonomous driving algorithms. [...] \"WeRide GENESIS builds us a digital universe that can be generated, scaled, and evolved on demand. With it, our AI drivers can familiarize themselves with the driving environment of any city worldwide within minutes, laying a solid technical foundation for the global commercialization of autonomous driving. This represents a true leap forward in industry capability,\" said Dr. Yan Li, Co-Founder and CTO of WeRide.\n\nThe launch of WeRide GENESIS showcases WeRide’s global leadership in autonomous driving simulation, AI agent modeling, and closed-loop iteration, marking a transformative breakthrough in the application of physical AI."

      "snippet": "Google’s Genie 3 also takes a different approach to world models than what LeCun has imagined. The model, available through Project Genie, essentially creates a continuous video-based world. Users can navigate that like a video game, but in theory, AI agents could also endlessly run through those worlds to understand how things work. LeCun’s idea when he was at Meta was to create Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), which embeds a model of the outside world in an AI agent. [...] Gadgets    James Pero\n\n### Everyone Really Needs to Pump the Brakes on That Viral Moltbot AI Agent\n\nIt's all fun and games until every aspect of your life is splashed all over the dark web.\n\nPrivacy & Security    AJ Dellinger\n\n### The CEO of the ADL Said Elon Musk Is the ‘Henry Ford of Our Time.’ Unfortunately, He Was Right.\n\nGrok, which once dubbed itself Mecha Hitler, is crowned the most anti-Semitic chatbot.\n\nArtificial Intelligence    AJ Dellinger\n\nJoin our Newsletters \n\nLatest \n\nTech News \n\n Artificial Intelligence\n Commerce\n Crime\n Cryptocurrencies\n Culture\n Gadgets\n Internet\n Politics\n Privacy & Security\n Robots\n Social Media\n Sploid\n Tech Policy\n Transportation\n\nReviews [...] The fact that Google is showing off a world model is interesting on its own. Unlike a large language model (LLM), the underlying technology that powers most consumer-facing AI tools including Google’s own Gemini, which use the vast amount of training data they are given to predict the most likely next part of a sequence, world models are trained on the dynamics of the real world, including physics and spatial properties, to create a simulation of how physical environments operate."

      "snippet": "In China, AI development is increasingly focused on practical integration in real‑world industries such as manufacturing and automotive systems rather than replicating ChatGPT‑style conversational agents. For many observers, LeCun’s track record — having predicted the deep learning revolution when others saw science fiction — makes his warnings hard to ignore.\n\nThe race for artificial intelligence has become more than a technological contest; experts say it is now a strategic struggle over the future of global economic and security leadership.\n\nThe commenter agrees to the privacy policy of Ynet News and agrees not to submit comments that violate the terms of use, including incitement, libel and expressions that exceed the accepted norms of freedom of speech.\n\n\"\" [...] Related Topics\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nMeta\n\nAI\n\nOne of artificial intelligence’s founding figures has abruptly left Meta, sounding a stark warning that the tech industry’s blind pursuit of giant language models — such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini — is steering the field toward a dead end.\n\nDr. Yann LeCun, a Turing Award winner and former chief AI scientist at Meta, exited the company months ago in what industry insiders describe as a dramatic professional split that resonated from California to Beijing. LeCun says the current focus on large language models will never yield a human‑level artificial intelligence. [...] A longtime advocate of open‑source development, LeCun calls Meta’s strategic shift a mistake. He says today’s language models are statistical machines that predict the next word and lack basic understanding of physics, planning or causality.\n\nAfter leaving Meta, LeCun founded AMI Labs (Advanced Machine Intelligence) in Paris. The startup is focused on “world models,” technology that aims to mimic how humans and animals learn — not by reading billions of pages of text, but by observing the world and understanding interactions among objects. LeCun notes that while a typical large language model may require the equivalent of 400,000 years of human reading to learn, human children grasp the world through thousands of hours of visual experience."

      "title": "No Pain, No Gain: Insilico ‘Gym’ Gets AI Models Into Shape - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News",
      "snippet": "#### Success story\n\nZhavoronkov cited as a successful example of an MMAI Gym-trained model Qwen3-14B, part of the latest generation of large language models in the Qwen3 model family developed by Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing division of Chinese tech giant Alibaba.  \n\nQwen3-14B has 14 billion parameters (hence its “14B” suffix), can support 119 languages and dialects, and is optimized for coding and agentic capabilities. But the tested open-source causal LLM failed on 70% of medicinal chemistry tasks before starting training via the gym, from which it emerged as a “single-model-does-it-all” chemistry engine. [...] The other Qwen variant to show improvement was Qwen3-1.7B, a 1.7-billion-parameter causal language model designed for high efficiency in desktop, mobile, and edge applications that include document analysis, coding, and multilingual support. Qwen3-1.7B features 28 layers, supports a 32k context window, and offers dual-mode operation designed for both rapid responses and advanced reasoning. Qwen3-1.7B improved on the Target-Bench open-source AI evaluation benchmark after undergoing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and GRPO training at the MMAI Gym. [...] So the newly public AI-based drug developer has launched Science MMAI Gym, a domain-specific training infrastructure designed to transform any “causal” large language model (LLM) like those that predict the next word in a sequence, or most-advanced “frontier” LLM into the best shape for drug discovery and development.  \n\nScience MMAI Gym is designed to adapt general-purpose LLMs—including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Mistral—for training to carry out tasks in medicinal chemistry, biology, and clinical development, with the aim of achieving the precision required for biopharma R&D."
