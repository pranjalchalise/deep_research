These limitations underscore the need for human or human-like oversight, rigorous model calibration, and hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine automated precision with human interpretive insight in essay assessment. Developing open, explainable, and transparent GenAI -based agents capable of evaluating student work in a human-like manner therefore represents a highly valuable advancement for education. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents an innovative paradigm within agentic artificial intelligence, combining the generative capabilities of GenAI with dynamic retrieval of external knowledge to enhance response accuracy and relevance .

Consequently, researchers recommend restricting GenAI use to formative or low-stakes assessment contexts where high-quality training data are available [18-19]. In response to these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework that enhances GenAI performance through the integration of external, curated knowledge sources . Unlike standalone GenAI, which rely solely on pre-trained parameters, RAG combines a generative model with a retrieval system that dynamically accesses relevant documents, enabling responses grounded in up-to-date and context-specific information [23-24]. RAG can interpret contextual cues, retrieve targeted materials, and generate adaptive outputs that reflect domain-specific reasoning. This hybrid architecture"

      "snippet": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI-driven education, enabling innovative applications across various learning and teaching domains. However, LLMs still face several challenges, including hallucination and static internal knowledge, which hinder their reliability in educational settings. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the LLM's generation process. This approach improves factual accuracy and enables dynamic knowledge updates, making LLMs particularly suitable for educational applications. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing research that integrates RAG into educational scenarios. We first clarify the definition and workflow of RAG, and [...] We first clarify the definition and workflow of RAG, and following the indexing mechanism of RAG, we introduce different types of retrievers and generation optimization methods. As the main focus of this work, we explore the practical applications of RAG in education, covering interactive learning systems, generation and assessment of educational content, and large-scale deployment in educational ecosystems. Based on our comprehensive review, this paper discusses existing challenges and future directions, including mitigating hallucinations, ensuring the completeness and timeliness of retrieved knowledge, reducing computational costs, and enhancing multimodal support for RAG-based educational applications.

This study presents an LLM-powered, agentic assessment system built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to address these challenges. The system integrates a large language model with a structured retrieval mechanism that accesses rubric criteria, exemplar essays, and instructor feedback to generate contextually grounded grades and formative comments. A mixed-methods evaluation was conducted using 701 student essays, combining quantitative analyses of inter-rater reliability, scoring alignment, and consistency with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative [...] with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative evaluation of feedback quality, pedagogical relevance, and student support. Results demonstrate that the RAG system can produce reliable, rubric-aligned feedback at scale, achieving 94--99% agreement with human evaluators, while also enhancing students' opportunities for self-regulated learning and engagement with assessment criteria. The discussion highlights both pedagogical limitations, including potential constraints on originality and feedback dialogue, and the transformative potential of RAG systems to augment instructors' capabilities, streamline assessment workflows, and support scalable, adaptive learning environments.

      "snippet": "then used to inform the generation process, ensuring that the responses are not only coherent but also contextually precise and up-to-date. This approach is particularly beneficial in educational settings, where the need for accurate, specific, and context-aware answers is crucial. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG chatbots can provide targeted support, addressing student queries with a higher degree of relevance and precision (Pichai, 2023). Given the distinct advantages of RAG chatbots in delivering precise and contextually relevant information, their use in educational settings presents a promising avenue for enhancing student support. This transition from general AI chatbots to more sophisticated RAG systems raises several pertinent questions regarding their [...] approaches and their use in educational settings. Following this, a chatbot powered by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) was designed to provide tailored conceptual explanations and code examples based on course materials, addressing a range of student inquiries. To evaluate its effectiveness, the study analyzed chatbot interaction logs and survey responses collected at the end of the course. Results showed that students with greater prior knowledge of the subject matter were more likely to engage with the chatbot, primarily seeking help on advanced topics not covered in the course lectures. Overall, students expressed high satisfaction with the chatbot, particularly valuing its ability to provide helpful explanations that are based on the course materials. This study highlights [...] their responses are limited to the information they have been trained on and do not automatically update with new data or specific documents (Jungherr, 2023). The technology that powers AI chatbots, i.e., large language models, has been shown to have useful applications in information systems education, specifically for writing of teaching cases (Lang et al., 2024). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots integrate retrieval mechanisms with their generation capabilities to enhance the accuracy and relevance of their responses. These chatbots first retrieve pertinent information from a predefined knowledge base or a set of documents before generating a response (Jeong, 2023; Maryamah et al., 2024). The retrieved information is then used to inform the generation process, ensuring that"

      "snippet": "Retrieval and pre-processing: RAGs leverage powerful search algorithms to query external data, such as web pages, knowledge bases, and databases. Once retrieved, the relevant information undergoes pre-processing, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.\n Grounded generation: The pre-processed retrieved information is then seamlessly incorporated into the pre-trained LLM. This integration enhances the LLM's context, providing it with a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. This augmented context enables the LLM to generate more precise, informative, and engaging responses.\n\n## Why use RAG? [...] By fine-tuning or prompt-engineering the LLM to generate text entirely based on the retrieved knowledge, RAG helps to minimize contradictions and inconsistencies in the generated text. This significantly improves the quality of the generated text, and improves the user experience.
