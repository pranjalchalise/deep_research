      "snippet": "Marius is particularly known for his military reforms, including the recruitment of volunteers from the lower classes, which transformed the Roman army into a professional fighting force. This shift not only enhanced military effectiveness but also changed soldiers' loyalties from the state to their generals, laying the groundwork for future political upheaval. Despite his military successes, Marius struggled politically, especially during his later years, where his ambition led him into tumultuous alliances that ultimately resulted in his political downfall. He died in 86 BCE, leaving behind a legacy marked by military innovation but marred by his failures in political leadership amidst Rome's growing civil discord.\n\n## Gaius Marius\n\nRoman general [...] ## Menu\n\n# Gaius Marius\n\nGaius Marius was a significant Roman general and political leader born around 157 BCE near Arpinum, Italy. Initially a farmer's son with limited formal education, Marius excelled in military service, first fighting in Spain against the Numantines and later rising through the ranks. His political career began in the Roman Republic, where he served as tribune of the people and later as consul multiple times, notably during critical military conflicts such as the Jugurthine War and against Germanic tribes like the Cimbri and Teutons. [...] Although Marius was a successful general, he failed as politician. His successive consulships are attributable not to political adroitness but to his skill as a general at a time when Rome was severely threatened. The year 100 marked a turning point in Marius’s career. Elected consul for the sixth time and immensely popular after his recent victories, Marius devised no program for social reform beyond that of acquiring land for his veterans. Inept as a public speaker and vacillating in his political decisions, Marius allowed himself to be led by the demagogues Saturninus and Glaucia, whose radicalism and violence precipitated his fall. Driven by ambition, Marius spent the remaining years of his life trying to recover his former power and prestige. At his death, Rome had entered a new era"

      "snippet": "## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarius was an extremely successful Roman general and politician. In ancient sources, he has been repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism. Plutarch says of him:\n\n> if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age. [...] Gaius Marius (Latin: (/wiki/Help:IPA/Latin \"Help:IPA/Latin\"); c. 157 BC – 13 January 86 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times. Rising from a family of smallholders in a village called Ceraetae in the district of Arpinum, Marius acquired his initial military experience serving with Scipio Aemilianus at the Siege of Numantia in 134 BC. He won election as tribune of the plebs in 119 BC and passed a law limiting aristocratic interference in elections. Barely elected praetor in 115 BC, he next became the governor of Further Spain where he campaigned against bandits. [...] After fifteen days of thanksgiving, Catulus and Marius celebrated a joint triumph. Plutarch reports that Marius was also hailed as \"the third founder of Rome\", but this is unlikely, as the identification of Camillus as a second founder dates to after the Sullan-era annalists and may be in fact post-Ciceronean. In the popular imagination, it was Marius who \"deserved to be the sole beneficiary of the two triumphs awarded for the decisive conclusion of the war\". At the same time, Marius's consular colleague, Manius Aquillius, defeated the Sicilian slave revolt in the Second Servile War. Having saved the Republic from destruction and at the height of his political powers, Marius desired another consulship to secure land grants for his veteran volunteers and to ensure he received appropriate"

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Marius showed himself no unprincipled candidate for popular favour, for he vetoed a popular grain bill, and the following years offered him little promise of a conspicuous career. He failed to secure the aedileship (control of markets and police) and was only just elected praetor (judicial magistrate) for the year 115 after bribing heavily, for which he was lucky to escape condemnation in court. The next year he governed Further Spain, campaigned successfully against bandits, and laid a foundation for great personal wealth through mining investments. After that, he made a good marriage into a patrician family that, after long obscurity, was on the point of strong political revival. His wife was Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar.\n\n## Election to the consulship [...] Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career"

      "snippet": "r/history icon\n\n# Gaius Marius, Third Founder of Rome...\n\nWhat sort of legacy does Marius have? I know he's renowned for reforming the Legions--- turning them from a militia into a professional army and allowing non-citizens to join. He was part of the growing populist faction, the populares, that wanted to expand citizenship and redistribute land.\n\nPlus, his reputation as a military commander won him a lot of acclaim. The Cimbri were one of the biggest threats the Republic had ever faced. He worked his way up from a humble background and eventually was given the nickname, \"the third founder of Rome.\"\n\nSo, all this stuff sounds pretty awesome. That's a remarkable resume for someone, and I feel like that's the sort of stuff that'd make one considered one of the greatest Romans ever. [...] This is from Adrian Goldsworthy,\n\n\"Marius in his later years was a selfish, vindictive and at times also pathetic figure, who plunged the Republic into the first of civil wars which would in time destroy it. Little seemed left of the genuine talent which had won him his unprecedented string of consulships and brought him victory over the Cimbri and Teutones.\"\n\n.\n\n\"His health was poor and his sanity sometimes questionable. He is supposed sometimes to have hallucinated that he was actually leading an army against Pontus, bellowing out commands and making signals to imaginary troops.\"\n\nAnd then this is from Mike Duncan, [...] And then this is from Mike Duncan,\n\n\"Like many old warhorses, Marius was uncomfortable being put out to pasture and soon found himself burning to get back in the game: 'As excellent a general as he was, he was an evil influence in time of peace, a man of unbounded ambition, insatiable, without self-control, and always an element of unrest.' This insatiable craving for more glory led to Marius' ruin, and in the years to come he would put 'the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and Forum... driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age.\"\n\nIn the Name of Rome, Adrian Goldsworthy.\n\nThe Storm Before the Storm, Mike Duncan."

      "snippet": "Finally, near the town of Aquae Sextiae, he sent 3,000 men for a surprise ambush. He led it personally, which was highly unusual. Marius led a final, decisive engagement against the Germans at the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC. It was yet another victory, and the Germans were again routed. Having defeated the Germans, Marius was hailed as Rome’s savior. Upon returning to Rome, he was again elected as consul for the sixth time. [...] The Romans themselves knew it: it’s fitting that their great origin myth (or at least, one of their great origin myths) was Romulus and Remus, the story of a brother killing a brother.\n\nIndeed, the poet Horace once wrote of the conflicts following Julius Caesar’s assassination:\n\n‘Bitter fate pursues the Romans, and the crime of a brother’s murder, ever since the blood of blameless Remus was spilt onto the ground to be a curse on his descendants.’\n\nLong after the tale of the twins was first told, but before Julius Caesar’s death, competing generals Marius and Sulla brought the Roman Republic to its knees with their brutal conflicts, in the first (but not last) large scale Roman civil war. [...] Marius further distinguished himself by serving as a junior military officer in the Jugurthine War in 109 BC. Exploiting his military prestige, the unorthodox Marius broke from tradition by running for the consulship in 107 BC. To bolster his electoral prospects, Marius presented himself as a true man of the people. He styled himself as a populist, whose personal competence and merit outshone the arbitrary privileges of Rome’s archaic aristocracy. “They may look down on my humble origins,” the gruff general remarked of Rome’s aristocrats, “but I have nothing but disdain for their idleness.”\n\nShare"

      "snippet": "Research Starters Home\n\nEBSCO Knowledge Advantage TM\n\n# Gaius Marius Creates a Private Army\n\nGaius Marius, a significant figure in Roman military history, transformed the Roman army from a citizen militia into a professional force during the late second century BCE. This transformation was necessitated by the demands of Rome's expanding empire, which required larger, longer-serving armies. Traditional recruitment methods, reliant on property ownership, became increasingly strained as small landholders struggled to balance farming and military service, particularly with the influx of cheap grain from conquered territories that undermined their livelihoods. [...] ## Key Figures\n\n Gaius Marius (157-86 b.c.e.), commoner who gained high civilian status through military achievements\n\n## Summary of Event\n\nMarius’s reforms of the Roman army were the culmination of developments arising out of Rome’s emergence as an imperial power. These reforms marked the beginning of developments that led to the civil wars of the late first century and the end of the Roman Republic. [...] The reforms of Tiberius and Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, designed to reestablish the small farmer class, failed to achieve their purpose while creating a climate of mutual suspicion and hostility between the ruling senatorial order and the rest of the Roman population. When Gaius Marius, an experienced soldier unconnected with the senatorial order, offered to remove the conduct of the Jugurthine War (111-105 b.c.e.) from the hands of the senate-appointed generals, he was elected to office by a large popular majority. Furthermore, over the objections of the senate, Marius was entrusted with the African campaign. Seeing the difficulties of raising an army in the traditional way, and less bound by tradition than generals of higher birth, Marius refused to order a conscription. Instead, he"
