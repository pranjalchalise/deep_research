      "snippet": "## 4. Enhancing Communication Skills and Productivity\n\nCrafting emails, presentations, or internal memos can be time-consuming, especially when starting from scratch. AI-powered drafting tools can provide starting templates or suggested text that employees can edit for tone and specificity.\n\nFor example, if an employee needs to follow up with a client, an AI tool can generate a polished, professional response based on previous correspondence. This boosts productivity by reducing time spent on communication tasks and ensures clarity and professionalism across messages. [...] ## 3. Automating Repetitive Tasks\n\nRepetitive tasks — such as copying and pasting content, data reformatting, or even renaming files — can drain productivity. By integrating AI tools into workflows to automate repetitive tasks, employees gain more time to focus on the innovative aspects of their work.\n\nFor instance, AI can batch-process document formatting across hundreds of files in a few minutes, automate invoice processing, schedule meetings, or generate routine performance reports, all significantly reducing manual labor. This not only speeds up operations but also minimizes errors that often occur in manual processes.\n\n## 4. Enhancing Communication Skills and Productivity [...] When using AI to fight AI, it’s important to implement guidelines to ensure the technology is being used ethically and responsibly. Adopting a formal AI policy and training, emphasizing human supervision, continuing to use traditional controls, and bracing for the future are keys to successfully using AI for organizational cybersecurity practices.\n\n## 7. Collaboration and Productivity Tools\n\nAs the scope of AI continues to expand, the technology is now seamlessly integrated with multiple productivity platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Trello to enhance collaboration. AI can suggest task assignments, recommend deadlines based on project data, or even summarize project updates for the team."

      "snippet": "### Clean up with predictive maintenance\n\nAI can be used for predictive maintenance by analyzing data directly from machinery to identify problems and flag required maintenance. AI is also used to improve mechanical efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in engines. Maintenance schedules can use AI-powered predictive analytics to create greater efficiencies.\n\n### See what's ahead\n\nAI can assist with forecasting. For example, a supply-chain function can use algorithms to predict future needs and the time products need to be shipped for timely arrival. This ability can help create new efficiencies, reduce overstocks and help make up for reordering oversights.\n\n## Industry AI use cases [...] ### Personalize customer experiences\n\nThe use of AI is effective for creating personalized experiences at scale through chatbots, digital assistants and customer interfaces. Using large language models (LLMs), these systems can deliver tailored experiences and targeted advertisements to customers and users. For example, Amazon reminds customers to reorder their most often-purchased products and shows them related products or suggestions. [...] ### Humanize Human Resources\n\nAI can attract, develop and retain a skills-first workforce. A flood of applications can be screened, sorted and passed to HR team members with precision. Manual promotion assessment tasks can be automated, making it easier to gain important HR insights with a clearer view of, for example, employees up for promotion and assessing their performance against key benchmarks. Routine questions from staff can be quickly answered by using AI.\n\nAI Academy\n\n### Become an AI expert\n\nGain the knowledge to prioritize AI investments that drive business growth.
