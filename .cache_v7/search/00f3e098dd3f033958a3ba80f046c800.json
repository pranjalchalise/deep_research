      "snippet": "In the lab, Claudio and his team examine the genome (hereditary information) and have developed new techniques to understand its function. Claudio emphasizes that the award is recognition for the entire research group, not just for him.  \n   \n - In describing the merits that are recognized by this prize it is for me of extreme importance my use of the plural pronoun we. Science is not a solitary endeavour. While the discoveries made by my research groups have been initially inspired by my previous work and ideas, these very ideas have been shaped, massaged, and re-built by my team members: all of them are becoming a better scientist than I will ever be, and each of them should be credited with an equal share of recognition.  \n   \n What is the secret behind your success? [...] In the award committee's citation, it can be read: \"Claudio Cantù is a passionate researcher who is driven by the question of how the genome regulates embryonic development and cell differentiation. In this work, he has had great success, which has shown itself in the form of significant research grants, as well as high-quality publications.” [...] ### Roadmap to strengthen LiU:s role in Europe\n\nLiU is increasing international presence by launching the Roadmap to Europe initiative. The aim is to deepen the university’s collaboration within Europe so as to strengthen education, research and collaboration with various stakeholders.\n\n### National initiative to protect AI systems from cyberattacks\n\nLiU will host a new national centre aimed at developing resilient AI systems. The funding of SEK 60 million comes from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research and its director will be LiU Professor Fredrik Heintz.\n\n### SEK 40 million from the Swedish Research Council for clinical therapy research"
