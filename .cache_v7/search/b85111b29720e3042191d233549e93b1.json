      "snippet": "Contextual document retrieval: RAG enhances the quality of the information retrieved by considering the context of your queries. For example, in engineering, RAG tools can locate documents that are pertinent to a particular phase of a project or specific technical requirements. They prevent information overload and ensure teams access content that addresses their needs directly.\n Real-time information access: In departments like sales or customer support, RAG can help close a deal or prevent a client from leaving a bad review. Teams can consult if specific information is accurate and quickly address customer concerns based on your products and services — especially if you have comprehensive FAQs, user guides, and client onboarding documents. [...] Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that improves text generation by incorporating data from databases, digital asset libraries, or other knowledge sources. Imagine a legal team searching for precedents in a vast collection of case law documents. Through RAG, they could quickly get a summary of a retrieved document and identify key points that they can validate and use to support their arguments.\n\nThanks to artificial intelligence (AI), this process happens in seconds. RAG uses AI-driven large language models (LLMs) — trained on massive datasets of text and code — to generate accurate and contextual content based on sources like documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. [...] ## How does retrieval-augmented generation work?\n\nSuppose you’re an insurance analyst who needs to check if a certain type of damage is covered under an extensive property policy. By integrating AI into your document management system, you could use RAG to ask a targeted question that directly addresses the coverage status in a given policy.\n\nFor instance, if you submit a query like “Is fire damage covered under property insurance policy number 1234567890?,” RAG will follow these three steps:"

      "snippet": "## What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. By incorporating new and context-aware data, AI can generate more accurate, current and domain-specific responses.\n\nRAG is quickly becoming the go-to architecture for building enterprise-grade AI applications. According to recent surveys, over 60% of organizations are developing AI-powered retrieval tools to improve reliability, reduce hallucinations and personalize outputs using internal data. [...] ## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?  \nRAG is an AI architecture that strengthens LLMs by retrieving relevant documents and injecting them into the prompt. This enables more accurate, current and domain-specific responses without taking time to retrain the model.\n\nWhen should I use RAG instead of fine-tuning?  \nUse RAG when you want to incorporate dynamic data without the cost or complexity of fine-tuning. It is ideal for use cases where accurate and timely information is required. [...] An easy and popular way to use your own data is to provide it as part of the prompt with which you query the LLM model. This is called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), as you would retrieve the relevant data and use it as augmented context for the LLM. Instead of relying solely on knowledge derived from the training data, a RAG workflow pulls relevant information and connects static LLMs with real-time data retrieval.\n\nWith RAG architecture, organizations can deploy any LLM model and augment it to return relevant results for their organization by giving it a small amount of their data without the costs and time of fine-tuning or pretraining the model.\n\n#### What are the use cases for RAG?\n\nThere are many different use cases for RAG. The most common ones are:"

      "snippet": "## Page topics\n\n## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.
