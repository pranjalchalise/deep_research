      "snippet": "### 🛡️ Ensuring Stability in React Applications\n\n For stable React applications, use mature, high-quality open-source libraries, but be sure to use version locks (e.g., via `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`) to avoid potential breaking changes that could disrupt the stability of your application during updates. This is a fundamental React best practice.\n When using Hooks, pay special attention to prevent circular dependencies; handle Hooks dependencies with great care. Using the linter can help identify potential issues early in the development process, ensuring a more stable and reliable application. This is crucial for modern React development.\n Be mindful of `XSS` protection; non-trusted content needs to be escaped before output. [...] Use AI Code Copilot to streamline the React development process, enhance developer productivity, and reduce the likelihood of errors by providing intelligent code suggestions and automating repetitive tasks. This is a growing trend in modern React development.\n Utilize good coding tools to enhance programming efficiency, such as `VSCode` and its powerful plugin ecosystem.\n Choose mature code build tools; for server-side rendering, use Next.js; for client-side SPAs, choose Vite; for static `SSG`, consider Astro, etc. Additionally, consider using `Turborepo` for MonoRepo project management. These choices impact your React development workflow. [...] Unify the `code writing style` and React coding best practices within the team. Reading resources like `Clean Code` helps ensure all team members adhere to best practices for maintainable React code. Use linters (e.g., ESLint with React plugins) to automatically enforce coding standards and catch potential errors early in the development process, fostering a collaborative environment where quality code is prioritized.\n Unify the code organization style within the team: directory organization, project organization (MonoRepo), etc. For large projects, it is reasonable to decompose and allow technical and business autonomy; oligarchic applications are not conducive to large team operations. Good React project structure is key."

      "snippet": "## ReactJS: Best practices 🔑\n\nWe have discussed about what React is, it’s applications, and why should a developer implement best practices while writing react code.  \n Using best practices in React development ensures the maintainability, scalability, and performance of the codebase. Also promoting code readability and understandability, which, as a result, reduces bugs and errors.\n\nAs far as best practices are concerned, we at Infrasity keep in mind all the best practices of writing code, inculcating all features of ReactJS effectively, using Linting tools, well-formatted code, making sure that comments are excluded when committing the code, and only necessary comments make it to the commits. [...] 1. Folder structure management\n2. State management\n3. React router for multi-page applications\n4. Lazy loading\n5. Reusable components\n6. Using React Hooks effectively\n7. Staying updated with new React features.\n\nLet’s get straight into it and discuss each practice one by one!\n\n### 1. Folder Structure management:\n\nA well maintained, and organized folder structure can help you, as well as other developers working together, understand the codebase better, identify various resources used in the project, etc.  \n This will not only help in scalability, but also with easy navigation throughout the various components.\n\nYou can break down functionalities into smaller, reusable modules to keep your codebase clean and organized.\n\nCheck the below code snippet for an example: [...] Keep your state as local as possible: Use local component state for UI-related states and keep it as close to where it is going to be used as possible to minimize the complex nature.\n\n Use context wherever possible: For application-wide state that needs to be accessed by many components, use the Context API to avoid prop drilling.  \n   Here’s where to learn more about the context API\n Limiting component creation: As much as react promotes creation of components for various functionalities, we have to limit this practice as it makes the state flow even more complicated.\n\nExample: If an app has 3 child components, LoginPage, HomePage, and featureSection page, its best to include the feature section inside HomePage itself, instead of creating a completely different component."

However, harnessing React’s full potential requires more than just basic familiarity. In this article, we’ll delve into a comprehensive array of best practices to elevate your React coding prowess. By adhering to these principles, you’ll forge applications that are not only robust and scalable but also easier to maintain and extend.\n\n## 1. Use functional components instead of class components [...] Flexibility in the Future: React has been advocating for the widespread adoption of hooks as the primary approach to writing components in recent years. The React team recommends using functions to create components, as they continue to invest in improving and expanding their capabilities.\n Enhancing Performance: Hooks make it easier to improve performance. Utilizing hooks like `useCallback` and `useMemo` allows you to cache functions and values, reducing the need for extra rendering iterations and enhancing component performance [...] Static Code Analysis: ESLint performs static analysis of your code, which means it examines the code without executing it. This allows ESLint to catch errors and potential issues early in the development process, helping to prevent bugs and improve code quality.\n Customizable Rules: ESLint allows you to define custom rules or use pre-defined rulesets tailored to React development. These rules enforce coding standards, best practices, and conventions within your project. For example, you can enforce the use of certain React patterns, such as using hooks correctly or avoiding deprecated methods."

A release goes out, the app feels slower, and the team starts chasing symptoms. That’s expensive, and it’s easy to optimize the wrong thing.\n\nWe’ve seen the same root causes across production codebases for more than a decade:\n\n Async work that accidentally becomes sequential\n Large client bundles that grow over time\n Components that re-render more than they need to [...] The “why” here is simple: these aren’t micro-optimizations. They show up as waiting time, jank, and repeat costs that hit every user session.\n\nSo, we put together this React best practices framework to make those problems easier to spot and faster to fix.\n\n### Link to headingThe core idea: ordering\n\nMost performance work fails because it starts too low in the stack.\n\nIf a request waterfall adds 600ms of waiting time, it doesn’t matter how optimized your `useMemo` calls are. If you ship an extra 300KB of JavaScript on every page, shaving a few microseconds off a loop won’t matter.\n\nPerformance work also compounds. A small regression you ship today becomes a long-term tax on every session until someone pays down the debt. [...] Parallelizing awaits\n\nAn API was waiting for one database call to finish before starting the next, even though they didn’t depend on each other. Running them at the same time cut the total wait in half.\n\nLazy State Initialization\n\nA component was parsing a JSON config from `localStorage` on every render, even though it only needed it once for state initialization. Wrapping the it in a callback (`useState(() => JSON.parse(...))`) eliminated wasted work.\n\n### Link to headingUsing `react-best-practices` in your coding agent\n\nThese best practices are also packaged up as Agent Skills that install into Opencode, Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and other coding agents. When your agent spots cascading `useEffect` calls or heavy client-side imports, it can reference these patterns and suggest fixes."

      "snippet": "but for props and sometimes use State and some of the State Management Solutions those are some situations where typescript comes in really helpful actually and so I would consider it the best practice to use typescript now by the way if you really want to master react and nextjs I highly recommend that you go through my professional react and nextjs course it has everything that you need to know and we start from absolute scratch and by the end we're building some pretty sophisticated react and xjs application so highly recommend you check it out you can find a link in the description all right another best practice is to keep your components dumb so what that means is you want to keep them simple essentially so as an example let's say that we have some kind of status bar here at the top [...] to use the used memo hook but for now the react compiler is not in react yet so uh we cannot use that yet so using use memo here I think would be uh I would say it's a best practice and by the way the way it works in react is that every time this component renders this function here is recreated right so every time this component renders a sort of like a new function a new function is created and assigned to this variable and that's what we then pass down here so just like what we saw previously with a calculation we can wrap that in a use memo you can do the same with functions if you don't want to recreate this every time we can we can wrap this in a use callback hook and let me import that and then we can specify when it should uh actually recreate it right so here we're saying it [...] we'll talk a little bit more about this later but it shows that we can not only customize The Styling or the jsx or the actual text in a particular instance but also the behavior when you actually interact with it right so I would say don't be afraid to create components as a best practice try to identify opportunities for reuse as well as when some element in the UI is distinct from something else right so here this logo thing is different from the to-do list here so those probably should be in two different components all right let's talk about the next best practice which is to avoid unnecessary div so I see this a lot let's say we are actually creating a new button component we already have one so let's say so let's just say BTN TSX cuz we already have one but just as an example let's"
