      "snippet": "icon\n\nOne of the pre-eminent Reformation scholars of his generation, Marius' two major scholarly works were biographies of Thomas More (1983), the English lawyer, Utopia \"Utopia (More book)\") writer, and politician who persecuted Protestants before being beheaded for refusing to accept Henry VIII's break with Catholicism, and of Martin Luther (1999), the monk whose criticism of the Catholic Church inspired the Protestant Reformation. [...] icon\n\nMarius served as director of Harvard's Expository Writing Program for sixteen years. The only class that all undergraduates were required to take, Expos introduced Harvard first-year students to college-level writing. Marius developed the program's curriculum, hired much of its teaching staff, and wrote two books about writing. A Writer's Companion, now in its fifth edition, and A Short Guide to Writing About History, now in its fourth edition, are both widely used as textbooks for instructional writing programs. With Harvey Wiener, Marius also co-wrote the McGraw-Hill College Handbook. [...] This intense period was also marked by other beginnings. Marius wrote his first novel, The Coming of Rain, published in 1969. The following year, he married Lanier Smythe, an art historian who later became chair of humanities at Boston's Suffolk University; they had a son named John. In 1974, he published his first scholarly book, a short biography of Martin Luther (a subject to which he returned in full 25 years later). In 1976, he published his second novel, Bound for the Promised Land."

      "snippet": "This partnership is planned to include prospective interventional studies examining the role of KYZATREX in prehabilitation and rehabilitation for patients undergoing surgery, ICU care, and trauma recovery. KYZATREX is indicated for the treatment of adult men with hypogonadism due to certain medical conditions. Research has shown that muscle mass plays a crucial role in patient recovery, influencing survival rates, reducing hospital complications, and lowering readmission risks.1,2 Testosterone levels decline significantly in many hospitalized patients, particularly those in the ICU, within just three to five days. This drop has been associated with higher mortality rates, prolonged ventilation needs, and extended hospital stays.3 [...] Raleigh, N.C., (March 3, 2025) – Marius Pharmaceuticals, a pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative therapies for testosterone deficiency, has partnered with Duke University School of Medicine to explore the potential of KYZATREX® (testosterone undecanoate) CIII capsules, an FDA-approved oral testosterone therapy, in improving patient outcomes before and after surgery, critical care, and acute or chronic illness. The collaboration will specifically examine the role of testosterone replacement in patients with secondary or acquired hypogonadism resulting from trauma, major surgery, or prolonged critical illness. Dr. Paul Wischmeyer, Duke Professor of Anesthesiology and Surgery and Director of Duke Online Clinical Nutrition Fellowship will lead the research efforts. [...] KYZATREX is a proprietary softgel oral formulation absorbed primarily via the lymphatic system (meaning it is not toxic to the liver) and indicated in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. The safety and efficacy of KYZATREX was demonstrated in a phase 3, multi-center, open-label, six-month study in 155 hypogonadal males between 18 and 65 years of age with documented hypogonadism, as defined by a below normal serum testosterone level (≤281 ng/dL) and at least one sign or symptom of testosterone deficiency. In the efficacy population (n=139), 88 percent of hypogonadal men treated with KYZATREX achieved a mean plasma total testosterone concentration (Cavg) over 24 hours within the normal range (222-800 ng/dL) on the final"

      "snippet": "Marius B. Hauknes is a historian of medieval art whose research focuses on the intersections of art, science, and myth. His first book, Art, Knowledge, and Papal Politics in Medieval Rome (Cambridge University Press, 2025), presents the first comprehensive study of the thirteenth-century fresco cycle in the Aula Gotica (“Gothic Hall”) of Santi Quattro Coronati in Rome, one of the most significant monuments of medieval Italian painting. The book argues that the Aula Gotica functioned as a large-scale encyclopedia—an immersive environment designed to stimulate intellectual inquiry and philosophical reflection. By reassessing Rome’s artistic culture in the mid-thirteenth century, it counters the assumption that the city lagged behind other centers, instead showing it to be a site of [...] Before joining Notre Dame, Hauknes was a Harper-Schmidt Fellow in the Society of Fellows in the Liberal Arts at the University of Chicago (2016-2017) and an Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University (2014-2016). His research has also been supported by fellowships from the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (2011–2013; 2022–2023), and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (2019–2020). His articles have appeared in leading journals including Gesta, The Art Bulletin, and Studies in Iconography. His essay “Painting Against Time: Spectatorship and Visual Entanglement in the Anagni Crypt” received the 2022 Arthur Kingsley Porter Prize from the College Art Association. [...] ## Publications"

      "title": "MaRIUS: Managing the risks, impacts and uncertainties of drought ...",
      "snippet": "The MaRIUS project has explored a risk-based approach to the management of droughts and water scarcity, drawing upon global experiences and insights from other hazards to society and the environment. MaRIUS has assessed, in the context of real case studies and future scenarios, how risk metrics can be used to inform management decisions and societal preparedness. Enquiry has taken place at a range of different scales, from households and farms to river basins and national scales.\n\n## Understanding impacts of drought for critical decisions [...] The environmental, economic and social dimensions of water scarcity have been assessed in an integrated way, which enabled exploratory analysis of feedbacks between impacts. For example, agricultural land use changes, driven in part by drought frequency, will, in turn, influence water quality and ecosystems. The interdisciplinary analysis enables comparison of likely outcomes arising from applying both pre-existing drought management arrangements (e.g. restrictions on water use, abstraction limits) and enhanced/innovative management strategies (e.g. use of outlook forecasts, dynamic tariffs). [...] A model of agricultural practices and output has been used to analyse drought impacts on agriculture and investigate the benefits of preparatory steps that may be taken by farmers. The potential economic losses due to water scarcity were analysed through a combination of ‘bottom-up’ study of households and businesses, and consideration of supply chain dependence on drought-sensitive industries.\n\n## More frequent droughts will affect land use, water quality and eco-systems"
