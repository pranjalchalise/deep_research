      "snippet": "John Smith was a prominent figure in the early history of the Jamestown settlement, having been born in England in 1580 and becoming a military adventurer before participating in the establishment of the first permanent English colony in America in 1607. Initially a council member for Jamestown, Smith faced challenges including imprisonment during the voyage to America, which temporarily prevented him from serving in leadership. Despite these setbacks, he played a crucial role in the colony's survival by engaging in foraging expeditions and trading with indigenous tribes for food. His contributions were recognized when he was elected president of the Jamestown Council in September 1608. However, his presidency was short-lived, as a reorganization in 1609 excluded him from leadership. [...] ## John Smith Assumes Jamestown Council Presidency\n\nJohn Smith, one of the first English colonists in America, was born in Willoughby in Lincolnshire, England, in 1580. He left England around 1596 and became a military adventurer abroad, fighting in wars against the Turks, probably until 1604. Upon his return to England he developed an interest in the London Company (sometimes called the Virginia Company) and became a member of the Company-financed expedition that in 1607 established the first permanent English settlement in America at Jamestown, Virginia. [...] During the colony's bleak first year, the settlers were underfed and wracked by disease. Their leaders, unprepared for frontier hardships, were also unaccustomed to the rigors of pioneer life. Smith went out on various foraging expeditions, explored, and mapped the countryside surrounding Jamestown, and warded off starvation by trading goods with the native tribes for food."

He claims to have had his life saved by Pocahontas, a Native American woman who allegedly fell in love with him. Smith played a key role in the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. [...] As a commemoration of his feats in battle, Smith had a coat of arms engraved with three heads (representing three Turkish officers he had killed) and the motto Vincere est Vivere, Latin for “to conquer is to live.”\n\n### Jamestown Colony\n\nFind out what it took to be a settler in the early-American colony of Jamestown.\n\n2:45m watch\n\n## Founding of Jamestown\n\nIn 1607, Smith’s military reputation helped earn him a spot in the group of men assembled by the Virginia Company to form an English colony in North America. With a charter from King James I in hand, 104 settlers sailed from England aboard three ships in December 1606. During the four-month sea voyage, expedition leaders arrested Smith for planning a mutiny and imprisoned him below decks in shackles. [...] When the ships reached Virginia in April 1607 and the settlers opened a box containing a list of men that the Virginia Company had appointed as a governing council for the new colony, Smith’s name was on the list. He was released and allowed to assume his council seat to lead Jamestown, established in May 1607 on the banks of the river they named for King James.\n\n## John Smith and Pocahontas\n\nThe new colony struggled with food shortages and disease, and in the fall of 1607 Smith began conducting expeditions to Native American villages to secure food. That December, a Powhatan hunting party captured Smith during one of these trips and brought him before Wahunsenacawh (commonly known as Chief Powhatan), the leader of most of the indigenous tribes in the Chesapeake Bay region."

He installed a policy of rigid discipline, strengthened defenses, and encouraged farming with his order that all must work or face starvation. Smith had settlers dig the first well inside the fort (and Jamestown Rediscovery archaeologists have found that well and the many unique artifacts it held when it became a trash pit). Smith ordered the repair of many buildings and the expansion of the fort into a five-sided structure, which archaeologists have also traced. Smith also led the first English explorations of the Chesapeake Bay and was almost killed by a ray on the first of the two expeditions. Smith’s strong leadership helped the colony survive and grow but also made him enemies within the fort. As he slept in [...] Restless in England, Smith became actively involved with plans by the Virginia Company to colonize Virginia for profit. Smith was on the fleet of three ships that set sail December 20, 1606, and during the four-month voyage was charged with mutiny by the leader of the expedition, Captain Christopher Newport. Smith was a prisoner when the ships reached Virginia in April 1607—but was released when the other colony leaders opened orders from the Virginia Company and discovered Smith was to be on the governing council. The colony struggled to feed itself, and Smith proved skillful at securing food from the Virginia Indians. He was exploring the Chickahominy River region in December 1607 when he was captured by Chief Powhatan’s men. Smith’s first meeting with Chief Powhatan, the supreme leader"

      "snippet": "Captain John Smith was a soldier and writer who is best known for his role in establishing the Virginia colony at Jamestown, England’s first permanent colony in North America. A farmer’s son, Smith was a soldier of fortune in Europe before he joined the Virginia Company of London expedition of 1606–1607. At Jamestown, Smith served on the local council; explored and mapped the Chesapeake Bay; established a sometimes-contentious relationship with Powhatan, the paramount chief of Tsenacomoco; and was president of the colony from September 1609 to September 1610. He was unpopular among his fellow colonists, however, who forced his return to England in October 1610. Smith never returned to Virginia, but he did travel to and map a portion of the northeast coast of North America, which he named [...] On September 10, 1608, Smith became president of the council at Jamestown. He immediately set about rebuilding and strengthening the colony’s defenses. His efforts included enlarging the triangular fort into a five-sided structure and requiring all colonists to work to support the settlement: “the labours of thirtie or fortie honest and industrious men shall not be consumed to maintaine a hundred and fiftie idle loyterers.” Smith forced them to grow crops, catch fish, and perform military drills, declaring, “He that will not work shall not eat.” He later claimed that as a result of his policies thirty or forty acres of ground were planted, a well of sweet water was dug in the fort, and some twenty houses, a blockhouse, and a separate fort were constructed. He also said that the number of [...] Smith did not return to New England; though he continued to write and publish, he was not asked to help establish the colony at Plymouth. In May 1621, he asked the Virginia Company of London for a reward in exchange for his service at Jamestown, where, he maintained, he had rebuilt the settlement twice, explored the countryside, and risked his life in service to the colony. Company officials referred his request to a committee, which apparently ignored it; the company rejected Smith yet again when he offered his services as a military commander in 1622, after Opechancanough led his men in a massive assault on English settlements along the James. In May 1623, the Virginia Company of London was the subject of a year-long investigation that resulted in its charter being revoked by the Crown"

      "snippet": "The time Smith spent abroad taught him that if he wanted to become a gentleman soldier he needed to improve his mind and his military skills. He immersed himself in classical military and political texts, taking Machiavelli and Marcus Aurelius as his models. Theodore Paleologue, the riding master to the Earl of Lincoln, taught him how to handle a horse, hold a lance, and speak Italian. He also passed on to Smith his hatred for the Turks. [...] The time that Smith had devoted to studying and training allowed him to become an impressive and creative soldier. During the battle for Limbach, a German fortress town besieged by the Turks, Smith drew on his military readings to devise a signaling system that let his regiment communicate with the Austrian garrison trapped inside. Using the torches, the garrison was told that the Austrian forces sent to liberate them would charge to the east of the town after nightfall. The garrison should be ready to support their attack. [...] In September 1609, Smith was injured when his powder bag exploded, ripping a nine-inch square chunk of flesh from his thigh. He jumped into the river to put out the fire only to almost drown from the shock. The injury forced his return to London, but even without it, Smith likely would not have been long for the colony. The company's shareholders in London instituted a reorganization of the colony's leadership. The new appointees sent by the London branch in the summer of 1609 had little regard for Smith, making the final months of his presidency a mutinous affair. Despite his experiences in Jamestown, Smith remained an advocate for colonization. He made one more trip to North America in 1614, this time to a region that he named New England."

      "snippet": "| Captain John Smith was an adventurer, soldier, explorer and author. Through the telling of his early life, we can trace the developments of a man who became a dominate force in the eventual success of Jamestown and the establishment of its legacy as the first permanent English settlement in North America.    John Smith was baptized on January 9, 1580, at Saint Helena's Church in Willoughby, Lincolnshire, England. His parents were George and Alice Smith. George was a yeoman farmer who owned land in Lincolnshire and also rented land from Lord Willoughby, his landlord and relation by marriage.  As a young boy, John attended local grammar schools learning reading, writing, arithmetic, and Latin. Not wanting to be a farmer, John ran away at age 13 to become a sailor, but his father stopped [...] Reverend Robert Hunt, he was allowed to assume his council position.    The first months of Jamestown's existence were very difficult due to food shortages, unhealthy drinking water, disease, occasional skirmishing with the Powhatan Indians, and ineffectual council leadership due to bickering and the untimely death of Bartholomew Gosnold. In the fall, Smith conducted expeditions to Powhatan villages securing food for the desperate colonists. On one such expedition in December he was captured by a large Powhatan hunting party and led on a long trek to various Powhatan villages, ultimately being brought before the paramount chief of the Powhatan people, Wahunsenacawh, better known as Chief Powhatan.     This encounter resulted in the famous story written by Smith of being saved from [...] Ukraine, Germany, France, Spain, and Morocco before finally returning to England in 1604. One author estimates Smith's travels from 1600-1604 covered nearly 11,000 miles! The captain was finally home, but not for long.    Smith's military exploits impressed prominent men in England, especially Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, a man intent on founding an English colony in the Chesapeake region of Virginia. Gosnold, and other important men in London, organized the Virginia Company of London and were granted a charter by King James I on April 10, 1606, to establish a colony in Virginia. In December 1606, the company dispatched three ships carrying 104 settlers, including Captain John Smith, to start this colony.     Established on May 13, 1607, the colony was named Jamestown, in honor of the"
