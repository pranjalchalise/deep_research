Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad(2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] Cities Reached\n\nStudents Connected\n\nTotal Projects\n\n0\n\n## Highlighted Projects\n\n 2020 - Computer Science\n\n  ## Drishti Nepal\n\n  Drishti is an android based mobile application that recognizes different Nepalese currency notes and gives its audio output.

We also extend our gratitude to Varun Gumma and Pranjal Chitale for their discussions on the evaluation metric and Sanoop Menon for his support during the data analysis process. Special thanks to all the reviewers and participants who contributed their time and insights to this study. We also thank Global Cornell for partly supporting this work. Lastly, we are thankful to the Compliance Team at Microsoft for their swift and timely support, without which this study and paper would not have been possible. [...] 4 2 RELATED WORK 2.1 Visual Storytelling Early works in story visualization have predominantly employed GAN or VAE-based approaches [14, 41, 43, 48, 77]. For example, StoryGAN  pioneered the story visualization task by proposing a GAN-based framework that considers both the full story and the current sentence for coherent image generation. Other early meth-ods adopted a dataset-driven approach, relying on models trained on popular datasets such as PororoSV , FlintstonesSV , or the StorySalon dataset . However, these methods face significant limitations due to the size and quality of existing datasets, making it difficult to generalize to diverse characters, scenes, and cultural contexts. The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models [17, 62, 65,"
