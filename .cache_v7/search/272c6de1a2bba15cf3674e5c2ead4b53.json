      "snippet": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI-driven education, enabling innovative applications across various learning and teaching domains. However, LLMs still face several challenges, including hallucination and static internal knowledge, which hinder their reliability in educational settings. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the LLM's generation process. This approach improves factual accuracy and enables dynamic knowledge updates, making LLMs particularly suitable for educational applications. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing research that integrates RAG into educational scenarios. We first clarify the definition and workflow of RAG, and [...] We first clarify the definition and workflow of RAG, and following the indexing mechanism of RAG, we introduce different types of retrievers and generation optimization methods. As the main focus of this work, we explore the practical applications of RAG in education, covering interactive learning systems, generation and assessment of educational content, and large-scale deployment in educational ecosystems. Based on our comprehensive review, this paper discusses existing challenges and future directions, including mitigating hallucinations, ensuring the completeness and timeliness of retrieved knowledge, reducing computational costs, and enhancing multimodal support for RAG-based educational applications.

      "snippet": "1. Specialized knowledge: LLMs need to understand financial terminology, concepts, and regulations.\n2. Access to updated information: Financial data changes frequently, so LLMs need real-time or near-real-time data access.\n3. Numerical reasoning: LLMs often struggle with arithmetic calculations.\n4. Handling structured and unstructured data: Financial information can be presented as tables, charts, and text, requiring LLMs to process all these formats.\n5. Reasoning with multiple sources: LLMs must analyze information from various sources to draw conclusions.\n\nBy combining the content generation capability of LLMs with the ability to retrieve information from vast data sources, RAG can provide more accurate, up-to-date, and reliable answers. [...] ### 1. Application of RAG technology in Finance\n\nIn the financial sector, RAG has broad potential to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs). According to FINANCEBENCH, a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on LLMs in finance, all tested LLMs exhibit weaknesses like hallucinations (generating false information), limiting their suitability for financial applications.\n\nTo address these challenges, experts have called for further research to develop LLMs that can better handle financial question-answering issues. These challenges include: [...] Sitemap\n\nOpen in app\n\nSign in\n\nWrite\n\nSearch\n\nSign in\n\n# Top 10 Use Cases of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — P1\n\nSoftware Development Aegona\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nFeb 17, 2025\n\n--\n\n## Today, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology enables AI systems to process queries and synthesize information from multiple sources to produce accurate and timely responses.

Including both medical and nonmedical participants allowed for a more realistic appraisal of trust, clarity, and usability in patient-facing contexts. [...] Beyond response evaluation, the survey included structured sections on empathy, clarity, usability, and response time. Users rated the chatbot’s friendliness, ability to recognize intent, trustworthiness, and clarity of medical explanations. In addition, participants assessed navigation, response latency, and overall satisfaction. At the end of the survey, users were given the opportunity to provide open-ended feedback for further improvements. The test group included a mix of medical professionals (students, residents, and specialists) and nonmedical users to reflect diverse perspectives, but no subgroup analysis was conducted.\n\n#### Automated Evaluation Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment Scale"
