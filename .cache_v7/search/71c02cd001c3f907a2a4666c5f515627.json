      "snippet": "An IDF soldier from the Military Police has been arrested on suspicion of fabricating the kidnapping of a Palestinian and demanding a ransom for his release, Army Radio reports.\n\nAccording to the report, the Palestinian had been arrested while attempting to illegally enter Israel from the West Bank, and he was taken to an army detention facility.\n\nAt the detention facility, a Military Police guard photographed the Palestinian detainee and sent the footage to his family, claiming that he had kidnapped him, the report says.\n\nArmy Radio says the soldier demanded that the family of the Palestinian send hom money in exchange for the release of their son. [...] According to the report, the Palestinian’s family contacted the police. Israeli security bodies initially believed the incident to be a matter of Jewish terrorism, but it later emerged that the Palestinian’s phone was located at an IDF detention facility.\n\nThe soldier involved in the case served in the Military Police — the IDF body that normally investigates soldiers — so the case will be handled by the military’s Internal Investigations Unit.\n\nThe IDF confirms the incident, saying an investigation has been launched, but adds that it “will not elaborate on the details of the investigation while it is ongoing.”\n\n## More from today’s Liveblog: [...] Most Popular\n\n A father in the shadows: How hostage Liam Or-Nassar’s heritage was hidden to protect him\n Witkoff and Kushner meet Netanyahu as US seeks to advance its Gaza peace plan\n Iran Guards have ‘finger on the trigger,’ chief of force says as US fleet heads to region\n Scale of Iran’s bloody crackdown comes into focus even as internet is out\n Iran’s tiny Tel Aviv outpost: City playground has surprising owners\n Netanyahu said to have barred Herzog from appearing at Trump’s Board of Peace unveiling\n Daughter of top Iranian official who led regime crackdown fired from US medical school\n US immigration officers kill man in Minnesota, apparently falsely saying he brandished a gun\n\nIf you’d like to comment, join   \n The Times of Israel Community."
