      "snippet": "In “Sufficient Context: A New Lens on Retrieval Augmented Generation Systems”, which appeared at ICLR 2025, we study the idea of \"sufficient context” in RAG systems. We show that it’s possible to know when an LLM has enough information to provide a correct answer to a question. We study the role that context (or lack thereof) plays in factual accuracy, and develop a way to quantify context sufficiency for LLMs. Our approach allows us to investigate the factors that influence the performance of RAG systems and to analyze when and why they succeed or fail. [...] We introduce a new notion of sufficient context to examine retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, developing a method to classify instances, analyzing failures of RAG systems, and proposing a way to reduce hallucinations.\n\n## Quick links\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant external context. For example, when using a RAG system for a question-answer (QA) task, the LLM receives a context that may be a combination of information from multiple sources, such as public webpages, private document corpora, or knowledge graphs. Ideally, the LLM either produces the correct answer or responds with “I don’t know” if certain key information is lacking.
