      "snippet": "LangGraph is an advanced framework designed for building stateful, multiagent applications.\n Nodes are functions that do the actual computation. Edges define how the execution flows from one step to the next. State is a shared memory that remembers everything across nodes.\n LangGraph’s unique capabilities include looping and branching for making dynamic decisions, state persistence to maintain context over long interactions, human-in-the-loop functionality for timely human interventions, and time travel to facilitate convenient debugging.\n LangGraph offers state management, allowing the workflow to maintain and modify context across different nodes. It also offers conditional transitions, enabling the workflow to make decisions at runtime and branch accordingly. [...] ## LangGraph — Architechture\n\nModern agent architectures enable AI systems to critique and refine their own output for higher quality. These “self-improving” agents use loops where the agent reviews its work and acts on feedback.\n\nLangGraph — a graph-based framework for stateful LLM applications — makes it easy to implement these patterns.\n\nLangGraph represents agents as graphs of states and nodes. The state (often a message history) flows through nodes (functions or LLM calls) linked by edges with conditional logic.\n\nLangGraph is an advanced, low-level framework within the LangChain ecosystem, designed for stateful, multi-agent AI applications. [...] Edges define how the execution flows between nodes, passing the updated state from one step to the next.\n Conditional edges allow the workflow to make dynamic decisions, routing the state to different nodes.\n Building a LangGraph application involves creating a StateGraph object, incorporating nodes, connecting them, setting an entry point, and then compiling the graph into a runnable application.\n Running a LangGraph workflow is done by invoking the compiled application with an initial state.\n Workflow visualization helps to understand the execution flow and how the state progresses through different nodes."

      "snippet": "# What is LangGraph?\n\n## Authors\n\nBryan Clark \n\nSenior Technology Advocate\n\n## LangGraph overview\n\nLangGraph, created by LangChain, is an open source AI agent framework designed to build, deploy and manage complex generative AI agent workflows. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable users to create, run and optimize large language models (LLMs) in a scalable and efficient manner. At its core, LangGraph uses the power of graph-based architectures to model and manage the intricate relationships between various components of an AI agent workflow. [...] LangGraph workflow\n\nLangGraph illuminates the processes within an AI workflow, allowing full transparency of the agent’s state. Within LangGraph, the “state” feature serves as a memory bank that records and tracks all the valuable information processed by the AI system. It’s similar to a digital notebook where the system captures and updates data as it moves through various stages of a workflow or graph analysis. [...] ## How LangGraph scales\n\nBy using a graph-based architecture, LangGraph enables users to scale artificial intelligence workflows without slowing down or sacrificing efficiency. LangGraph uses enhanced decision-making by modeling complex relationships between nodes, which means it uses AI agents to analyze their past actions and feedback. In the world of LLMs, this process is referred to as reflection.\n\nEnhanced decision-making: By modeling complex relationships between nodes, LangGraph provides a framework for building more effective decision-making systems.\n\nIncreased flexibility: An open source nature and modular design for developers to integrate new components and adapt existing workflows."

Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with models and tools.We will commonly use LangChain components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don’t need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain’s agents that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling [...] LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for _any_ long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:\n   Durable execution: Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.\n   Human-in-the-loop: Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.\n   Comprehensive memory: Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.\n   Debugging with LangSmith: Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics."

      "snippet": "## LangGraph basics\n\nLangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem, so we will continue using well-known concepts like prompt templates, tools, etc. However, LangGraph brings a bunch of additional concepts. Let’s discuss them.\n\nLangGraph is created to define cyclical graphs. Graphs consist of the following elements:\n\n Nodes represent actual actions and can be either LLMs, agents or functions. Also, a special END node marks the end of execution.\n Edges connect nodes and determine the execution flow of your graph. There are basic edges that simply link one node to another and conditional edges that incorporate if-statements and additional logic. [...] Overall, I find LangGraph quite a powerful framework for building complex LLM applications:\n\n LangGraph is a low-level framework that offers extensive customisation options, allowing you to build precisely what you need.\n Since LangGraph is built on top of LangChain, it’s seamlessly integrated into its ecosystem, making it easy to leverage existing tools and components.\n\nHowever, there are areas where LangGrpah could be improved: [...] As LLM applications, particularly LLM agents, have evolved, we’ve begun to use LLMs not just for execution but also as reasoning engines. This shift has introduced interactions that frequently involve repetition (cycles) and complex conditions. In such scenarios, LCEL is not sufficient, so LangChain implemented a new module — LangGraph.\n\nLangGraph (as you might guess from the name) models all interactions as cyclical graphs. These graphs enable the development of advanced workflows and interactions with multiple loops and if-statements, making it a handy tool for creating both agent and multi-agent workflows."
