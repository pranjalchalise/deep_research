      "snippet": "stimuli is an especially important indicator of attentional orientation, suggesting that further research on this is warranted (Teicher et al., 1996; Lavine et al., 2002; Seyama, 2006; Frischen et al., 2007). Our approach includes these objective locomotor measures provided by the HMD, allowing a more comprehensive approach to the assessment of ADHD compared to most CPT-based studies. Although capturing the movement itself is not clinically valid or useful, it certainly opens new fields for the study and validation of this approach. [...] Our results showed a significant positive correlation between task-irrelevant head movement during the VR-CPT with visual/audio social cues and ADHD-RS scores, the most commonly used standard scale to measure ADHD symptoms in clinical practice. This result supports our first hypothesis that head movement data in a virtual environment can effectively represent the degree of ADHD symptoms, reflecting real-life performance reported via ADHD-RS scales. This correlation was not observed in the HC group, possibly implying the specificity of this mode of measurement in the ADHD group. However, these results should be interpreted with our small sample size in consideration. Future replicative studies with a larger sample size would be needed to solidify our findings. [...] We quantified head movements in children and adolescents with and without ADHD using automated measurement, which showed different tendencies depending on the presence or absence of social and non-social stimuli. These findings suggest the possibility of using automated head motion measurement in a VR environment as a reliable objective method to quantify the hyperactivity component of ADHD symptoms to supplement the current subjective manner of ADHD symptom measurement. This proof-of-concept study not only provides a new, relatively ecologically valid way of conducting studies aimed at understanding how various cues affect the attention of children in a classroom environment, but may also improve the understanding of nonverbal behavior in ADHD and assist with designing online educational"

      "title": "Functional properties of habenular neurons are determined by ...",
      "snippet": "Previous studies showed that habenula receives olfactory (22) and visual (23) inputs and responds to both of these sensory modalities (34, 35, 43). To investigate how these sensory inputs maturate during habenula development, we visualized the mitral cell and thalamic axon terminals in habenula using Tg(lhx2a:gap-YFP) (22) and Et(−0.6hsp70l:Gal4-VP16) s1020t; Tg(UAS:nfsB-mCherry) (31, 44) zebrafish lines, respectively. At all ages, thalamic projections were found to innervate habenula (Fig. 2A, blue) in distinct locations that are different from GABAergic innervations (Fig. 2A, white) or mitral cell terminals (Fig. 2A, red). Yet, the density of olfactory bulb projections increased with age (Fig. 2A, red). These findings suggest that habenular neurons may be predominantly light responsive [...] at 6 and 21 dpf (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we observed that significantly larger number of habenular neurons respond to light compared to mechanical vibrations at 6 dpf (Fig. 3B). At 21 dpf, we no longer observed any significant difference between the number of neurons responding to light, electric stimuli, and vibrations (Fig. 3B). These three different stimulus modalities exhibit low correlations at all developmental stages (Fig. 3C). All these results suggest that while the 3-dpf habenula preferentially responds to light, the animal develops significantly more habenular neurons respond to aversive electrical stimuli, as the animal develops. Together, the developing habenula can selectively encode an expanding number of sensory modalities with an increasing preference for aversive electrical [...] In this study, we investigated how the function and the architecture of habenular networks change across development and how these alterations relate to the formation of distinct functional modules within habenula. We showed that as the habenula expands, the number of neurons increases, inhibitory connections are formed, and sensory inputs are integrated with a temporal order. Moreover, we revealed that the habenula is a multisensory brain region, which distinctly encodes different sensory modalities. Visual and olfactory responses in habenula develop early, while the responses to mechanosensory and aversive stimuli develop at later stages. Spontaneous habenular activity is present already at early developmental stages, and it is predictive of the habenular neurons with sensory responses."

      "title": "Hand preference for the visual and auditory modalities in humans ...",
      "snippet": "The present results further suggested that both the visual preference and the auditory preference groups showed a consistent pattern of mutual interaction between the sensory and the hand dominance effect. First, the hand dominance effect was boosted by the sensory dominance effect. Whenever the dominant hand was paired with its preferred modality and won the multisensory competition (i.e., when vision won the multisensory competition in the right hand-vision correspondence condition for the visual preference group, and when audition won multisensory competition in the right hand-audition correspondence condition for the auditory preference group), the hand dominance effect was boosted (Fig. 3b, c, right). Second, the sensory dominance effect was boosted by the preferred hand-modality [...] The absence of a consistent superiority of the dominant hand for the whole group supports our hypothesis concerning individuals’ different hand-modality preferences. Some individuals might have their dominant hand preference for vision, and non-dominant hand preference for audition, and vice versa for other individuals. Therefore, no hand effect was found when the data were collapsed over all individuals irrespective of their hand preferences for different sensory modalities. We next calculated the Pearson correlation between the dominant-hand-for-vision index in the unimodal and the bimodal conditions to test the individual hand-modality preference’s stability. The two measures were significantly correlated, r = 0.612, p < 0.001 (Fig. 3a). Thus, participants showed the same hand-modality [...] To verify the potential interaction between sensory dominance and hand dominance in the unimodal condition, RTs of the unimodal trials were analyzed with a 2 (sensory modality: visual vs. auditory) by 2 (response hand: dominant vs. non-dominant hand) repeated-measures ANOVA. The main effect of the sensory modality was significant, F(1,56) = 9.01, p = 0.004, ηp2 = 0.139, indicating that RTs in the Visual-Single trials (603 ± 14 ms) were significantly faster than RTs in the Auditory-Single trials (620 ± 14 ms). The main effect of the response hand was not significant, F(1,56) = 3.19, p = 0.079, ηp2 = 0.054. The interaction was significant, F(1,56) = 134.50, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.706. Further planned t tests on simple effects showed that, for the unimodal visual targets, RTs of the dominant"

      "snippet": "The present study is limited in that it does not provide comparison with another clinical pain condition. Our task was designed to provide a naturalistic presentation of multimodal sensory stimulation, and therefore our approach does not isolate the net contribution of each stimulation modality to the observed results. This may be particularly relevant for the tactile task component, which involved self-generated finger movements and thus additional brain activity in the motor system. Between-group differences in task activation were found for auditory and visual areas, but not for the somatosensory cortex. The lack of significant results at this level could be related to the more complex nature of the sensorimotor task. Future research aimed at isolating modality-specific abnormalities [...] was associated with reduced pressure pain thresholds, has been documented in FM (22). Altered functional connectivity between the posterior insula and the so-called default mode network, which is known for its relevance in different aspects of self-referential processing, has also been described in FM and was associated with spontaneous pain (53). Our finding broadens the picture of posterior insula abnormalities in FM by documenting an amplified insula response to nonpainful stimulation in FM patients across sensory modalities. [...] We found a paradoxical and intriguing cross-modal effect in the analysis of correlations; for example, hypersensitivity to sounds was correlated with visual cortex hypoactivation in the patient group. There is increasing evidence of relevant cross-sensory interaction at the cortical level (45) and evidence that neural activity in primary sensory areas is modulated by signals from the other primary sensory cortices (46). In this context, the observed correlations may reflect cross-modal attenuation or down-regulation of sensory processes in response to a situation of multisensory hypersensitivity in FM. Alternative explanations may include potential competing effects of attentional resources during concurrent processing of different sensory modalities (47)."

However, due to the high heterogeneity of ASD, this mechanism is only one of the potential explanations, and the specific mechanism requires further verification. Patil pointed out in a review that the differences in sensory processing in ASD individuals may stem from multiple mechanisms, including Altered Neural Connectivity, Sensory Gating Dysfunction, Atypical Sensory Modulation, Imbalance in Sensory Excitation and Inhibition, and Atypical Multisensory Integration.148 These potential mechanisms explain the complex patterns and individual differences in tactile processing in patients ASD individuals. [...] Tactiles play an important role in object recognition, awareness of the current environmental state, and social and emotional communication. Therefore, studying how the healthy brain executes the processing of tactile perception forms the basis for understanding sensation and behavior. Moreover, investigating aberrant sensory processing in pathological conditions offers potential targets for clinical neuroregulation. Hence, the depiction of the somatosensory cortex is vital for comprehending the neural underpinnings of human somatic sensation. This article provides a brief overview of the basic principles of fMRI, summarizes the current findings of fMRI touch research, and elucidates the central nervous system processing mechanisms of different aspects of touch. The possible pathological [...] In recent years, with the development of multimodal neuroimaging techniques, such as the combination of fMRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging, has provided new opportunities to explore the mechanisms of tactile impairments in individuals with ASD. Currently, due to the inconsistency in the resting-state functional connectivity results in ASD individuals, future research could combine methods such as Granger causality analysis and dynamic functional connectivity under tactile conditional stimulation to further explore the mechanisms of tactile processing in ASD individuals. These research findings are expected to support the development of neuroimaging-based assessment tools and provide a theoretical foundation for the formulation of personalized treatment plans."
