      "snippet": "Claudius’s multiple handicaps and infirmities were readily apparent. He had weak knees, trembling hands, and a wobbly head; he dragged his right foot, walked with a limp, stuttered when he spoke, and drooled uncontrollably. Desiring to preserve an image of power and authority in the eyes of the Roman people, the Imperial family kept Claudius’s public appearances to a minimum. Although not permitted a career in government service, Claudius received an excellent education. As he grew older, he became more and more interested in historical studies and wrote numerous scholarly works on Roman, Etruscan, and Carthaginian history. In addition, he wrote an apology for Cicero and composed an autobiography. Not content to limit himself to historical work, Claudius studied philological problems of [...] ## Claudius I\n\nRoman emperor (r. 41-54 c.e.)\n\nComing to power after the politically and financially devastating reign of Caligula, Claudius I completed the centralizing tendencies of Roman Imperial government by creating a bureaucracy that was totally professional in training and totally loyal in its devotion to the Imperial concept of government.\n\n## Early Life [...] ## Menu\n\n# Claudius I\n\nClaudius I, born Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus in Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France), was the youngest son of prominent Roman parents and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Initially underestimated due to his physical disabilities, Claudius was not expected to achieve significant power. However, his life took a dramatic turn when he became emperor in 41 CE after the assassination of his nephew Caligula. Despite his late rise to power, Claudius implemented significant reforms, centralizing administration and extending citizenship to provincial communities, which facilitated their integration into the Roman Empire."

His mother and grandmother referred to him as 'half-formed' and 'a fool.' He was the teased as a boy and his family hid him from public view, expecting little of him. Claudius took advantage of his isolation and educated himself. [...] Despite his lack of political experience, Claudius proved to be an able ruler. During his reign he expanded his empire. He issued many edicts, ranging from the promotion of cures for various diseases and the treatment of slaves. He ruled, for example that slaves who recovered after having given up to die, would be freed. Claudius also created many public works such as aqueduct for carrying water through Rome, a new port, and the draining of a lake.\n\nCopyright © 2001-2023 by Judith Felson Duchan\n\nLast revised:\n\nPlease send comments or corrections to jaduchan@gmail.com [...] free website hit counter\n\n|  |  |\n --- |\n| Judy Duchan's home page | A History of Speech - Language Pathology |\n| Ancient History: 3500 BC - 500 AD |\n\nJudy Duchan's home page\n\n# Browse History\n\n## Ancient History\n\n## Middle Ages\n\n## Early Modern\n\n## Enlightenment/ 18th Century\n\n## 19th Century\n\n## ASHA's European Ancestry\n\n## 20th Century\n\n## 21st Century\n\n## Related Topics\n\n# Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\n\n# 10 BC–54 AD\n\nClaudius was the fourth Roman Emperor who ruled from 41 AD until his death in 54 AD."

Best know for the successful expansion of Rome into Britain and parts of Africa and the Middle East, Claudius was an accomplished leader who brought forth improvements to the empire's judicial system, passed laws protecting enslaved workers, extended Roman citizenship and gave citizens more rights. [...] Claudius abandoned his political aspirations and filled his days with drinking, gambling and womanizing until A.D. 37, when his nephew Caligula assumed the imperial purple. Caligula was inexperienced and vulnerable, and to help shore up his claim to the throne, he appointed Claudius, then almost 46 years old, as his co-consul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.\n\n## Claudius was an accomplished historian.\n\nWhen he wasn’t distracting himself with drink and games of chance, Claudius spent long hours immersed in books and academic study. Despite having been labeled a dullard by his family, he possessed a keen intellect that impressed the historian Livy, who encouraged him to take up writing. [...] In A.D. 43, he dispatched a force of 40,000 troops and several war elephants across the English Channel. The Romans had soon conquered a stronghold at modern day Colchester, and eventually succeeding in capturing the Catuvellauni tribal leader Caratacus. Claudius visited Britain during the invasion and remained for 16 days before returning to a hero’s welcome in Rome. He was later honored with a triumphal arch on the Via Flaminia that hailed him as the man who “brought barbarian peoples beyond Ocean for the first time under Rome’s sway.”\n\n6.\n\n## He was an avid fan of the Roman games."

      "snippet": "Claudius was born on 1 August 10 BC in Gaul (now France) into the Roman imperial family. Tiberius, the second emperor of Rome, was his uncle. Claudius suffered from physical disabilities, including a limp and a speech impediment and was therefore treated with disdain by his family, and not considered as a future emperor. When Tiberius's successor Caligula was assassinated in January 41 AD, the Praetorian Guard found Claudius in the palace and acclaimed him as emperor. The senate held out against Claudius for two days, but then accepted him."
