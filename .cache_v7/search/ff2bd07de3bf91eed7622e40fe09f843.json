His academic interest in philosophy deeply shaped his worldview, influencing both his martial arts approach and his later quotes. During this time, Lee opened his first martial arts school, teaching kung fu while continuing to study and refine his techniques. [...] In 1964, Lee relocated to Oakland, California, where he opened a second school. It was during this period that he developed his own martial arts philosophy and system, Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid style blending traditional kung fu, boxing, fencing, and philosophical principles. Rather than rigid forms, Jeet Kune Do emphasized adaptability, efficiency, and personal expression. Lee rejected tradition for tradition’s sake, insisting that practitioners learn from mistakes rather than hide from them, as per information sourced from Britannica and IMDb."

      "snippet": "Skip to Content \n\nPlay For Thoughts\n\nPlay For Thoughts\n\n# Bruce Lee’s Philosophy: Self-Actualization And Being Like Water To Live a Better Life\n\nWritten By Mateusz Siniło\n\nBruce Lee was not only a movie star and martial arts master but essentially a philosopher who created a way of being based on the spiritual and physical aspects of the martial arts. His coherent and rational way of living has resulted in many insightful aphorisms which are collected in the book \"Striking Thoughts\".\n\nBruce represented the attitude of the modern stoic with ancient discipline and wisdom. His conceptions, that I found the most enlightened are Self-Actualization and what I like to call \"Self-Adaptation\" which he famously essentializes as \"be like water, my friend\". [...] #### Summary:\n\n1. Stop participating in a social performance full of different roles and concepts. It’s all a facade. Instead, focus on the honest and sincere development of your potential and self-actualization.\n2. Being an individualist who accepts reality as it is with all its qualities means to be truly free.\n3. Having a clear mind and being “formless” are your superpowers that can be used as tools to form reality.\n4. Don’t be a slave to any kind of patterns - from tradition to role models.\n5. The goal of a human being is to actualize oneself.\n\n> “We live in cliches, in patterned behavior. We are playing the same role over and over again. To raise our potential is TO LIVE AND REVIEW EVERY SECOND REFRESHED” - Bruce Lee [...] Contemporary martial artist and philosopher as a steely individualist developed a highly grounded philosophy, in which self-recognition is the highest state. He said, “A self-actualizing person is a real person”.\n\nHis philosophy is closely related and easily adapted to daily living because for him philosophy is what life is. You cannot separate these two things.\n\nHope you find something valuable for yourself that you can apply in your everyday life. I wish you good reading!\n\n#### 1. Self-Actualization"

      "snippet": "Is that you? That’s been me.\n\nNow we’re going to bring in another philosopher who helped me understand what Bruce was saying. We’re bringing in Jiddu Krishnamurti.\n\nKrishnamurti was cool. Bruce Lee would kick his ass in a fight, but if they did a podcast together or something, they would create some cool intellectual synergy.\n\nKrishnamurti was big into “being free”. Hippy stuff, but I think he was more realistic and in touch with the modern world than most Eastern philosophers. He didn’t preach about ego death too much, he just wanted you to free yourself from what you know so that you can connect with “what is”.\n\nThat’s a big mistake people make. [...] That is what Bruce Lee meant when he said that quote above, which I will include for you one more time here:\n\n> “The meaning of life is that it is to be lived, and it is not to be traded and conceptualized and squeezed into a pattern of systems.”\n\nThat is also what Krishnamurti meant when he said this:\n\n> “We are always comparing what we are with what should be.”\n\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nWe got into some weird stuff today.\n\nIt doesn’t really have a whole lot to do with Jiu-Jitsu.\n\nOr does it?\n\nTo summarize, this is the biggest lesson you can take from this article:\n\nCut yourself some slack. [...] We say silly cop-out answers like “the meaning of life is chocolate” or serious but unhelpful ones like “the meaning of life is to make a meaning”. The problem is that these ideas don’t help. They don’t make us smarter and they don’t help us live better.\n\nThe meaning of life is to “make a meaning”? That’s the philosophical equivalent of answering a question with a question.\n\nAt first, that kind of cop-out answer is what I thought Bruce Lee was saying in his book Striking Thoughts when he said this:\n\n> “The meaning of life is that it is to be lived, and it is not to be traded and conceptualized and squeezed into a pattern of systems.”\n\n“The meaning of life is that it is to be lived”? Yeah, no shit, Scherlock.\n\nBut it’s deeper than that. The second part is really the important part."
