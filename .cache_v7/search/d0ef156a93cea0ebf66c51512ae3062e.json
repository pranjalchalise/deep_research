      "snippet": "Federated learning holds great potential for enabling large-scale healthcare research and collaboration across multiple centers while ensuring data privacy and security are not compromised. Although numerous recent studies suggest or utilize federated learning based methods in healthcare, it remains unclear which ones have potential clinical utility. This review paper considers and analyzes the most recent studies up to May 2024 that describe federated learning based methods in healthcare. After a thorough review, we find that the vast majority are not appropriate for clinical use due to their methodological flaws and/or underlying biases which include but are not limited to privacy concerns, generalization issues, and communication costs. As a result, the effectiveness of federated [...] ## Keywords\n\nFederated learning\n\nHealthcare\n\nPitfalls\n\nChallenges\n\nRecommendations\n\nOpportunities\n\n## Data availability\n\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.\n\n## Cited by (0)\n\n© 2025 The Authors.

Although his family pressed him to join his father in the textile industry, he instead chose to pursue electrical engineering. He studied at Seoul National University and then at Columbia University, in New York City, where he earned his doctorate under Edward S. Yang, a specialist in transistor theory. Shortly after, in the summer of 1970, Fairchild Camera and Instrument hired Kim to work in its research and development laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\nKim, shown on the Columbia campus, studied for his Ph.D. at the university under Edward S.
