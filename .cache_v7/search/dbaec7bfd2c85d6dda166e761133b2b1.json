      "snippet": "### How to use retrieval augmented generation: 5 use cases\n\n#### 1. Enhanced content crafting with RAG\n\nThe RAG technique can significantly streamline and improve content creation to make it tailored and more specific to the user’s needs. You can ask a few LLMs questions without providing additional context to help with content creation, but you will find that the quality greatly increases after providing relevant and well-labeled data to the LLM. This will streamline the user experience by generating improved initial drafts, summaries, or even complete articles with the most relevant and up-to-date data. [...] This powerful combination leads to a high level of data gathering and insight creation. It helps analysts simplify and make sense of complex information from various sources. Utilizing the RAG technique, companies can quickly identify trends, understand competitors’ activities based on publicly available information, and gauge market changes. [...] With RAG’s data retrieval capabilities and LLMs’ natural language processing, users can engage in data-driven dialogues that go beyond basic information retrieval. This approach allows the LLM to generate responses that are contextually relevant and supported by the most current and accurate data sourced. The use of APIs can provide the pipelines for fresh data to flow into the model, ensuring that every conversation is supported by the most current and comprehensive information available. With this level of augmentation, the model can return concise summaries or detailed reports as if they were part of a natural back-and-forth conversation. This empowers decision-makers to extract insights and take action without ever having to write a line of code or run a complex query."

      "snippet": "Healthcare – RAG has potential in the healthcare industry, where access to accurate and timely information is crucial. By retrieving and incorporating relevant medical knowledge from external sources, RAG can provide more accurate and context-aware responses in healthcare applications. Such applications augment the information accessible by a human clinician, who ultimately makes the call and not the model.\n Legal – RAG can be applied powerfully in legal scenarios, such as mergers and acquisitions, where complex legal documents provide context for queries. This can help legal professionals rapidly navigate complex regulatory issues. [...] Search engines – RAG-enabled search engines can provide more accurate and up-to-date featured snippets in their search results.\n Question-answering systems – RAG can improve the quality of responses in question-answering systems. The retrieval-based model uses similarity search to find relevant passages or documents that contain the answer. Then, it generates a concise and relevant response based on that information.\n Retail or e-commerce – RAG can enhance the user experience in e-commerce by providing more relevant and personalized product recommendations. By retrieving and incorporating information about user preferences and product details, RAG can generate more accurate and helpful recommendations for customers. [...] Industrial or manufacturing – In manufacturing, RAG helps you quickly access critical information, such as factory plant operations. It can also help with decision-making processes, troubleshooting, and organizational innovation. For manufacturers who operate within stringent regulatory frameworks, RAG can swiftly retrieve updated regulations and compliance standards from internal and external sources, such as from industry standards or regulatory agencies."
