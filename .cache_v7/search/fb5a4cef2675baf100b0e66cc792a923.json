Ltd. organised a virtual award ceremony the other evening to announce the award.\n\nChalise was selected among the top six finanlists - Anurag Chapagain, 18, Youtuber, from Nawalparasi, Deepak Sutihar, 19, Social Entrepreneur from Saptari, Khusbu Bhandari, 18, Wildlife Conservationist from Chitwan, Neha Gurung, 19, Social Activist from Kathmandu and Sabhya Rai, 19, Education Activist from IIam. [...] Chalise has aided the blind community by inventing Drishti Nepal, which helps visually impaired people in currency bills recognition and cash transactions.\n\nLikewise, he has developed a mobile application that provides agricultural news and information from authentic sources. His another app is a Women Safety app to ensure the security of women and ensure they are not deprived of opportunities due to their safety reasons.\n\nHis other two educational apps have 7,500 users.\n\nChalise has also initiated a non-profit tech venture E-educators Nepal, which enhances the quality of online education and makes educational resources more accessible. [...] Furthermore, he is the member of the board of Initiative in Nepal Foundation, and currently working on a research paper about the Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts and the ways in which technological advancement can mitigate the costs of elongated transaction processes.\n\nThe organiser said that it was the seventh iteration of the Glocal Teen Hero Award, which is the only national platform in Nepal to identify and honour outstanding teenagers whose creativity, commitment, experience, and strong leadership have helped them achieve success in life.\n\nAbout 611 teenagers had applied for the competition."

But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020)\n\n“A surreal utopia where friends turned into F.R.I.E.N.D.S, and fanatics into professionals. Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] Are the candidates who were not offered a place in the last two years eligible?\n\n## Program Overview\n\nIs the program free?\n\nWhere will the program be held?\n\nHow will the 8 weeks of the program be organized?\n\n## Selection Procedure\n\nWhen is the application due?\n\nAre there any cut-offs for GPA/grades for the application process?\n\nIs the selection process holistic or is there a certain part of the application that is more important?\n\n## Projects\n\nWhat are some example projects students will work on?\n\nDo we get to choose projects of our interests or are they assigned randomly?\n\n## Further Queries\n\nWhy should I participate in the program?\n\nIs this program only for Science and Engineering students?\n\nDo you give priority to the high schoolers over those in gap year?"
