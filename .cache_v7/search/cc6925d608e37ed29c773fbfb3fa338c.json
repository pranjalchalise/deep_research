In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to [...] ## History\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\n\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel \"Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)\"), an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym self-teaching computers was also used during this time period. [...] Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning.\n\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework.\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning"

      "snippet": "Machine learning (ML) has evolved dramatically from its early foundations in statistical methods to the deep learning architectures we see today. This paper takes a historical perspective on the development of machine learning, diving into major eras that have shaped its landscape: from the classical regression models to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), and the transformative impact of the attention mechanism with the rise of transformers. Each era is defined by its unique paradigm, challenges, and breakthroughs. The goal of this paper is to not only chronicle the development of machine learning but also build an intuitive understanding of the technical depth within each phase, from classical statistical models to the state-of-the-art architectures [...] ## 1. Introduction\n\nMachine learning, at its core, is the science of making machines learn from data, enabling them to make decisions without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. While the concept of “learning” has its roots in centuries-old statistical methods, it has evolved through various stages — each phase characterized by new methods, challenges, and computational techniques.

      "snippet": "Throughout the 1950s, the first major experiments in artificial intelligence took place. While the groundwork for what would become modern machine learning was laid more than 70 years ago, it struggled with the technological limitations of the day. Besides lacking the sheer computing power needed for complex calculations, old computers could only execute commands and not follow them, an important aspect of modern machine learning. [...] ## The Classical Machine Learning Era\n\nThe beginning of the Classical ML Era is around 2005. Classical machine learning — also known as statistical learning — uses models or algorithms to analyse massive data sets, identify patterns, and make predictions. Common models include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbours algorithms, and support vector machines, just to name a few.  \n\nUnlike the deep learning neural network models that would be subsequently introduced, classical machine learning models are less computationally cumbersome. They rely more on the quality of the training data set than deep learning models. Due to their more straightforward training and operational processes, these models are considered \"Explainable AI.\" [...] ### Ancient AI\n\nFollowing the Second World War, mathematicians and scientists began exploring the creation of AI and ML. Alan Turing, the famous computer scientist whobroke the Nazi’s Enigma Code during WWII and is credited as the Father of AI, wrote about the possibility for machines to mimic human thinking through computations based on available data and reason in his 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence."

      "snippet": "Machine learning is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”\n\nThe definition holds true, according to a lecturer at MIT Sloan and head of machine learning at Kensho, which specializes in artificial intelligence for the finance and U.S. intelligence communities. He compared the traditional way of programming computers, or “software 1.0,” to baking, where a recipe calls for precise amounts of ingredients and tells the baker to mix for an exact amount of time. Traditional programming similarly requires creating detailed instructions for the computer to follow. [...] ## What is machine learning?\n\nMachine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.\n\nThe goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit “intelligent behaviors” like humans, according to Boris Katz, a principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL. This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language, or perform an action in the physical world. [...] Skip to main content\n\n#### Faculty Thomas W.
