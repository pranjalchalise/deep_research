Contributing to two different teams- ‘Team Kisan' and ‘Team Drishti' was overwhelming but the realization that, through my projects, I could deliver ripple effects in the community- be it in the lives of farmers or differently-abled people, was certainly more promising. A bunch of high-school pass-outs coming together to create impacts on society sounds a bit fancy. At Incubate Nepal you'll witness countless such fancy sugarcoats turning into real-life realities.”\n\n2020\n\n## Anupa Khanal\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020) [...] 2021\n\n## Aayusha Dhungana\n\nTeam Samsad(2021)\n\n“Politics and Social science, something that I was not really fond of. But to my own surprise, I was paired up with my team mates to build a website featuring parliament system of Nepal. Entering the whole new world of website building and politics surely frightened me, but the continuous support from the mentor and my wonderful team made this whole journey very smooth and informative. Incubate Nepal, helped me break my comforting cocoon and stand out in the crowd to learn, take challenges and share tons of memories with the whole team.”\n\n2021\n\n## Pranjal Chalise\n\nTeam Kisan, Team Drishti(2020) [...] 2020\n\n## Aarasi Shrestha\n\nTeam Arthasastra(2020)\n\n“Incubate Nepal provided students like me with a platform to share our knowledge on a wide range of topics, hone our leadership skills and team spirit, and it acted as a stepping stone towards accomplishing our future goals and ambitions. Being a team member of ‘Team Arthasastra,' my teammates and I prepared an empirical Economics research paper. Last-minute virtual meetings to complete the tasks that we were assigned, late nights of watching YouTube videos and reading articles on econometrics, and listening to the amazing weekly presentations from different groups helped me in more ways than I thought it would.”\n\n2020\n\n## Mahesh Yadav\n\nTeam Brahmanda(2020)"
