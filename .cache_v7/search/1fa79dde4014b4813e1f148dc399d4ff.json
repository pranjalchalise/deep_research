      "snippet": "Brace was also highly regarded for his expertise in staff building. He was skilled at assembling strong teams of individ-uals to serve as managers, and combining those peo-ple with efficient administrative support. Brace, through his commitment to ongoing training and goal setting, created an environment of independent thinking individuals who also served as an extremely cohesive staff. The result of Brace’s person-centered leadership technique was a high level of morale in the Ys in which he served. In 1999, the Rotary Club of Charlotte posthumously honored Brace with its Excellence in Management Award. Brace would conclude his Y career at the YMCA of Greater Charlotte in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he served as president for more than sixteen years. Brace, described as possessing a [...] and volunteer participation in the YMCA, and exemplified the ideals of the YMCA and Springfield College in his or her personal and professional life. In recognition of Springfield College’s historic partner-ship with the YMCA, dating back to , the Advisory Council and Hall of Fame Committee chose the College as the site for the YMCA Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame has been endorsed and supported by the YMCA of the USA, the National Council of the YMCA of Canada, and the YMCA Retirement Fund. The Hall of Fame Committee has reviewed nomina-tions submitted by executives throughout the USA and Canada and has unanimously elected Richard Bailey, Harry H. Brace, James F. Bunting, and Richard W. MacMorran for induction into the YMCA Hall of Fame at Springfield College Richard Bailey’s career [...] more than sixteen years. Brace, described as possessing a unique mix of respect for his colleagues and sound business sense, led the YMCA of Greater Charlotte to a membership increase from 45,994 to more than 106,000 between the years 1983 and 1999. Under Brace’s leadership, the Ys budget grew from $5 million to $40 million during that same time. With Brace leading the way, the YMCA of Greater Charlotte became one of the most successful Ys in the country, recognized not only by Y officials and fitness experts, but also by children and families alike. Brace and his staff throughout the years focused on creating better communities. Following in his father’s footsteps led Brace to a distinguished 40-year career with the YMCA. He believed in, and was committed to, the ideal of spirit, mind,"
