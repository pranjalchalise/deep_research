      "snippet": "Gaius Marius (Latin: (/wiki/Help:IPA/Latin \"Help:IPA/Latin\"); c. 157 BC – 13 January 86 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. Victor of the Cimbric and Jugurthine wars, he held the office of consul an unprecedented seven times. Rising from a family of smallholders in a village called Ceraetae in the district of Arpinum, Marius acquired his initial military experience serving with Scipio Aemilianus at the Siege of Numantia in 134 BC. He won election as tribune of the plebs in 119 BC and passed a law limiting aristocratic interference in elections. Barely elected praetor in 115 BC, he next became the governor of Further Spain where he campaigned against bandits. [...] Marius was born in Cereatae c. 157 BC, a small village near the town of Arpinum in south-east Latium. The town had been conquered by the Romans in the late 4th century BC and was initially given Roman citizenship without voting rights (civitas sine suffragio). Only in 188 BC, thirty years before his birth, did the town receive full citizenship. Although Plutarch claims that Marius's father was a labourer, this is almost certainly false since Marius had connections with the nobility in Rome, he ran for local office in Arpinum, and he had marriage relations with the local nobility in Arpinum, all of which when taken together indicate that he was born into a locally important family of equestrian \"Equestrian (Roman)\") status. While many of the problems he faced during his early career in [...] ## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMarius was an extremely successful Roman general and politician. In ancient sources, he has been repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism. Plutarch says of him:\n\n> if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age."

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius (born c. 157 bce, Cereatae, near Arpinum [Arpino], Latium [now in Italy]—died January 13, 86 bce, Rome) was a Roman general and politician, consul seven times (107, 104–100, 86 bce), who was the first Roman to illustrate the political support that a successful general could derive from the votes of his old army veterans.\n\n## Early career [...] Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer.

      "snippet": "## Gaius Marius\n\nGaius Marius (c. 157 BCE – 86 BCE) was a Roman general and politician who, in his early military career, had served under Scipio Aemilianus (of Third Punic War fame) in an expedition to Numantia in Iberia. He went on to have a distinguished military and political career, but not without controversy. As you will see from the excerpts from Plutarch’s Parallel Lives below, Marius was ambitious, and what was known as a novo homo or “new man” (one who was the first in his family to serve in the Senate and be elected consul). His policies leaned decidedly towards the poulares which also made him enemies among the senators who supported the optimates faction.\n\n### Life of Gaius Marius (excerpts) by Plutarch [...] III. Marius was the son of obscure parents, who gained their living by the labor of their hands, and were poor. His father’s name was Marius; his mother’s name was Fulcinia. It was late before he saw Rome and became acquainted with the habits of the city, up to which time he lived at Cirrhæato, a village in the territory of Arpinum, where his mode of life was rude, when contrasted with the polite and artificial fashions of a city, but temperate and in accordance with the old Roman discipline. He first served against the Celtiberians when Scipio Africanus was besieging Numantia, and he attracted the notice of his commander by his superiority in courage over all the other young soldiers, and by the readiness with which he adapted himself to the change in living which Scipio introduced among [...] VI. During his prætorship Marius got only a moderate degree of credit. But on the expiration of his office, he obtained by lot the further province of Iberia (Spain), and it is said that during his command he cleared all the robber establishments out of his government, which was still an uncivilized country in its habits and in a savage state, as the Iberians had not yet ceased to consider robbery as no dishonorable occupation. Though Marius had now embarked on a public career, he had neither wealth nor eloquence, by means of which those who then held the chief power were used to manage the people. But the resoluteness of his character, and his enduring perseverance in toil, and his plain manner of living, got him the popular favor, and he increased in estimation and influence, so as to"

      "snippet": "r/history icon\n\n# Gaius Marius, Third Founder of Rome...\n\nWhat sort of legacy does Marius have? I know he's renowned for reforming the Legions--- turning them from a militia into a professional army and allowing non-citizens to join. He was part of the growing populist faction, the populares, that wanted to expand citizenship and redistribute land.\n\nPlus, his reputation as a military commander won him a lot of acclaim. The Cimbri were one of the biggest threats the Republic had ever faced. He worked his way up from a humble background and eventually was given the nickname, \"the third founder of Rome.\"\n\nSo, all this stuff sounds pretty awesome. That's a remarkable resume for someone, and I feel like that's the sort of stuff that'd make one considered one of the greatest Romans ever. [...] This is from Adrian Goldsworthy,\n\n\"Marius in his later years was a selfish, vindictive and at times also pathetic figure, who plunged the Republic into the first of civil wars which would in time destroy it. Little seemed left of the genuine talent which had won him his unprecedented string of consulships and brought him victory over the Cimbri and Teutones.\"\n\n.\n\n\"His health was poor and his sanity sometimes questionable. He is supposed sometimes to have hallucinated that he was actually leading an army against Pontus, bellowing out commands and making signals to imaginary troops.\"\n\nAnd then this is from Mike Duncan, [...] And then this is from Mike Duncan,\n\n\"Like many old warhorses, Marius was uncomfortable being put out to pasture and soon found himself burning to get back in the game: 'As excellent a general as he was, he was an evil influence in time of peace, a man of unbounded ambition, insatiable, without self-control, and always an element of unrest.' This insatiable craving for more glory led to Marius' ruin, and in the years to come he would put 'the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and Forum... driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age.\"\n\nIn the Name of Rome, Adrian Goldsworthy.\n\nThe Storm Before the Storm, Mike Duncan."
