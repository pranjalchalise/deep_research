      "snippet": "Outside his role as the acting CEO of Pax, Marius is a skilled painter. He graduated with honors from the Florence College of Art, a time he describes as special and extremely happy,, and he has returned to Stellis for post-graduate studies in art and art history in addition to his duties at Pax. He credits Van Kerrel with beginning his interest in art, having attended an auction he ran at age five.\n\nTo distinguish Marius from his brother, directors and veteran Pax employees refer to him as \"Mr. Marius,\" while outsiders tend to buy into his rich brat persona and call him \"Master Marius\" or, more respectfully, \"Mr. von Hagen.\"\n\n### Childhood[edit | edit source] [...] It is difficult to understand this second young master. The inconvenient demands Marius must deal with every day are unimaginable. The public and secret battles against the top executives of the family conglomerate is not for the faint hearted. Moreover, he dislikes hypocritical social rules and refuses to give face to those who flatter and fawn. Perhaps instead of inheriting the family business, he would rather be free and unconstrained in creating art. Marius has completed an undergraduate course majoring in oil painting at the reputable Florence College of Art and is presently studying in the art department of Stellis University. One may think this kind of young master is ignorant and incompetent, but Marius' paintings are absolutely amazing. If one has the chance, it is highly [...] Marius attended Starhigh High School, Stellis' most prestigious private school, but he only stayed for a year. His status as a von Hagen made him the target of significant unwanted attention, and when false rumors of a feud between him and his brother made the situation worse and affected Giann's recent position at Pax, Marius left the country at age 16 to attend high school abroad instead to protect his family, claiming it would help him get used to foreign cultures before his enrollment at the Florence College of Art. The move required him to start over since his previous credits weren't accepted, but he attained all necessary credits to graduate in only two years.\n\n## Personality and Interests[edit | edit source]"

      "snippet": "Gaius Marius was a strong and brave soldier and a skillful general, popular with his troops, but he showed little flair for politics and was not a good public speaker. As an equestrian, he lacked the education in Greek normal to the upper classes. He was superstitious and overwhelmingly ambitious, and, because he failed to force the aristocracy to accept him, despite his great military success, he suffered from an inferiority complex that may help explain his jealousy and vindictive cruelty. As a young officer-cadet, along with Jugurtha (later king of Numidia), on Scipio Aemilianus’ staff in the Numantine War in Spain (134 bce), he, like Jugurtha, made an excellent impression on his commanding officer. Marius’ family enjoyed the patronage of more than one noble family, in particular the [...] Fact-checked by\n\nBritannica Editors\n\nEncyclopaedia Britannica's editors oversee subject areas in which they have extensive knowledge, whether from years of experience gained by working on that content or via study for an advanced degree....\n\n Britannica Editors\n\nHistory\n\nTop Questions\n\n Who was Gaius Marius?\n What role did Gaius Marius play in the Roman army?\n Why is Gaius Marius famous in Roman history?\n How did Gaius Marius change the structure of the Roman army?\n What wars or battles was Gaius Marius known for fighting in?\n How did Gaius Marius influence politics and later events in Rome?

      "snippet": "While Marius had seemingly broken with the Caecilii Metelli during his time as tribune and praetor, the Metelli did not seem to hold this rupture against him so much as to pass over him for selection as legate in the opening phases of the Jugurthine War. In 109 BC, likely to improve his chances for the consulship, Marius joined then-consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus in his campaign against Jugurtha. In Sallust's long account of Metellus's campaign, no other legates are mentioned, so Marius was probably Metellus's senior subordinate and right-hand man. Metellus was using Marius's strong military experience, while Marius was strengthening his position to stand for the consulship. [...] Plutarch relates several opinions on the end of Marius: one, from Posidonius, holds that Marius contracted pleurisy; Gaius Piso has it that Marius walked with his friends and discussed all of his accomplishments with them, adding that no intelligent man ought leave himself to fortune. Plutarch then anonymously relates that Marius, having gone into a fit of passion in which he announced in a delusionary manner that he was in command of the Mithridatic War, began to act as he would have on the field of battle; finally, Plutarch relates that, ever an ambitious man, Marius lamented on his deathbed that he had not achieved all of which he was capable, despite his having acquired great wealth and having been chosen consul more times than any man before him. [...] Seeking troops to bolster the forces in Numidia and win his promised quick victory, Marius found it difficult to recruit from Rome's traditional source of manpower, property-holding men. Except in emergencies, normal practice in the middle republic was only to allow property-owning citizens to enlist in the legions; this may have been related to Tiberius Gracchus's reforms which would have, by giving more people more land, made more men eligible to serve in the legions. While the senate allowed Marius to conscript men normally, he preferred instead to request volunteers, especially among discharged veterans (evocati), with promises of victory and plunder. He also recruited volunteers from men without property, the capite censi. With more troops mustering in southern Italy, Marius sailed"
