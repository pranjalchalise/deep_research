      "snippet": "# What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\n## What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)?\n\nRetrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architecture for optimizing the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) model by connecting it with external knowledge bases. RAG helps large language models (LLMs) deliver more relevant responses at a higher quality.\n\nGenerative AI (gen AI) models are trained on large datasets and refer to this information to generate outputs. However, training datasets are finite and limited to the information the AI developer can access—public domain works, internet articles, social media content and other publicly accessible data."
