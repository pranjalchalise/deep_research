[...] This report discusses the basics of quantum computing along with necessary terminologies one needs to know in order to understand the working of quantum computers. Quantum computing is a branch of computing that uses quantum theory to solve problems that are too large or complex for traditional computers, and at exponentially faster rates. These machines manipulate the quantum state of an object to produce qubits to perform complex operations. These qubits lead to the formation of quantum gates that further combine to create quantum circuits, which are the basic functional blocks of a quantum computer and are responsible for performing operations using one of the many quantum algorithms.

      "snippet": "Here, we'll take a closer look at the basics of quantum computing, including quantum theory, quantum entanglement, quantum bits, and the ongoing evolution of quantum computers.\n\n## Quantum Mechanics Primer\n\nQuantum computing uses the properties of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers can’t. It differs from classical computing in terms of the basic units of information and how they operate. The elements of quantum computing include the following:\n\n### Quantum Bits (Qubits) and Superposition [...] ### Quantum Entanglement and Quantum States\n\nAnother key principle of quantum computing is entanglement, a strong correlation that exists between quantum particles. When two qubits are entangled, the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This property is used in quantum computing to link qubits in a way that amplifies quantum computing speed and power exponentially as more qubits are entangled.5\n\n### Quantum Gates and Circuits [...] This principle is what allows a qubit to be in multiple states at once. It's akin to spinning a coin; while it’s in the air, the coin is in a superposition of states of heads and tails. Only when it lands—or is measured, in the case of a qubit—does it assume a definite state. This superposition enables quantum computers to perform many calculations and produce more efficient algorithms all at once.4\n\n### Quantum Entanglement and Quantum States"

      "snippet": "### How the principles work together\n\nTo better understand quantum computing, consider that two surprising ideas are both true. The first is that objects that can be measured as having definite states—qubits in superposition with defined probability amplitudes—behave randomly. The second is that distant objects—in this case, entangled qubits—can still behave in ways that, though individually random, are strongly correlated.

With a quantum computer, some problems that might take a classical computer thousands of years to solve might be solved in a matter of minutes or hours.\n\nQuantum mechanics, the study of physics at very small scales, reveals surprising fundamental natural principles. Quantum computers specifically harness these phenomena to access mathematical methods of solving problems not available with classical computing alone."

      "snippet": "Entanglement and superposition are used in many of the newer quantum technologies being developed today, such as quantum networking, quantum communication and quantum computing. Quantum bits, or qubits, that are entangled with each other have a potential “quantum advantage” that can allow them to solve some calculations much faster than classical computers and that allows exponential improvement of computing power with the number of qubits.\n\n### Spin\n\nWhile wave-particle duality, superposition, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and entanglement are all manifestations of the fact that quantum systems have wave-like behavior, spin is off on its own. [...] ## Quantum in action\n\nBefore the early 2000s, computers did not exhibit quantum behavior. But as technology advanced and transistors in computers got smaller (now as small as 5 nanometers, which is 5 billionths of a meter!), they started to show quantum behavior. Quantum behavior limits how small transistors can be and how fast computers can compute because it makes transistors “pesky” in that they don’t exhibit the predictable behavior that engineers want. For this reason, computers now operate on multiple “cores” to help increase computing speed and power.\n\n## The Wonderful World of Quantum\n\nWhen you zoom in on matter at the quantum scale, nature gets granular. At this scale, we find tiny particles such as: [...] 1. Wave-particle duality: Tiny particles look like they are behaving like waves or particles, depending on how you observe them.\n2. Superposition: In the quantum world, particles can exist in multiple states at once.\n3. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Nature imposes a fundamental limit on how precisely you can measure something. (You can’t measure certain pairs of properties at the same time with unlimited precision.)\n4. Entanglement: Two things can be so interconnected that they influence each other, regardless of distance apart.\n5. Spin: Spin is a fundamental characteristic of elementary particles. Like mass or charge, spin determines a particle’s behavior and interaction with other particles."

Cryptography and Data Security\n\nQuantum computing can play a major role in cryptography and data security, aiming to address the growing challenges of protecting sensitive information. By relying on the principles of the quantum mechanical model, quantum communication protocols like Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offer theoretical security advantages based on the laws of quantum physics. These protocols can detect eavesdropping attempts during key exchange, potentially enabling more secure communication channels. However, implementing such systems comes with significant technical challenges and practical limitations that researchers continue to address.
