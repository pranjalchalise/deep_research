      "snippet": "Many of these processes already use AI and machine learning to optimize and perform complex tasks and modeling, and more complicated manufacturing processes already test the bounds of modern computing.\n\nWith the addition of quantum computers, these tasks will be simplified and customized. This will allow for more accurate and customized manufacturing, which can in turn lead to improvements in processes such as the development of new vehicles, batteries and more.\n\n## Future Applications of Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computing is an exciting technological development poised to impact a wide variety of fields and industries. From chemistry to aerospace engineering to the stock market, it is impossible to overstate the potential that quantum computing brings to the table. [...] Quantum computing is still developing, so there are likely many applications that we cannot yet imagine. There will no doubt be many exciting discoveries to come as organizations, schools, and companies across the globe race to develop the future of quantum computing.\n\nThe EPB Quantum NetworkSM launched in 2022 and was designed to generate, distribute and measure qubits across an established fiber optic network. The network is available to both public and private sectors who want to run existing applications, test new quantum technologies or validate equipment performance. Learn more about the EPB Quantum Network.\n\nGirls watching TV services Chattanooga, TN\nwhat is quantum\n\n### Follow us on\n\n## \n\nThanks, we'll be in touch soon! [...] ### 3. Drug Discovery and Material Science\n\nPharmaceutical research and material sciences stand to gain significantly from quantum computing as well. After quantum computing has matured, experts in the medical and computing industries anticipate augmenting current research methods with quantum computing in order to discover new molecules, decode and predict changes in proteins, or develop new treatment protocols through machine learning.\n\nWith current computing methods, discovering and testing new drugs can take over 10 years and more than 2 billion dollars on average. This is because pharmaceutical research requires lengthy trial and error testing, which relies on error-prone technology such as X-ray, and due to the complexities of developing clinical trials."

Google Quantum AI's mission is to build this computer and unlock solutions to classically intractable problems.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nFuture uses for quantum computing\n\nQuantum computing matters because of the revolutionary potential of its future applications. Quantum computers will be instrumental in modeling inherently quantum mechanical phenomena—problems with a \"hidden structure\" that can't be seen with a classical computer.\n\n# Drug discovery [...] # Performing benchmark tasks\n\nEarly quantum exploration involves using quantum computers to explore benchmark tasks. Researchers created simulators to observe quantum algorithms in ideal conditions to help prepare for experiments on actual quantum hardware.\n\n# Embracing current NISQ applications\n\nOur exploration of Noisy, Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) applications aims to identify a realistic path toward using current quantum systems to solve scientific and industrial problems before developing a fault tolerant quantum computer.\n\n# Looking at the fault tolerant future"

      "snippet": "Google says that researchers gave a computer random instructions to make a problem as complex under quantum mechanics as possible. Its researchers were then able to show that a quantum computer is faster at deciphering the quantum problem. Last year, Google said that its new, faster quantum computer Sycamore had expanded the performance gap.\n\nIn terms of future real-world applications, most of the potential for quantum computers is in the realms of medicine, chemistry and materials research.\n\nGoogle points to drug discovery, or finding molecules that could be useful medicines. It also says that quantum computers will be able to do the science needed to commercialize fusion energy. [...] When Microsoft announced its first quantum chip in February, the company highlighted chemistry and materials science problems, like why some materials corrode, or how to compost plastic.\n\nThere is also some optimism that quantum computers will be well suited for generating training data for AI applications, especially for situations or problems with a huge number of potential solutions.\n\nA Google researcher maintains a webpage that catalogs many of the most prominent quantum algorithms.\n\nThe most famous is Shor's algorithm, which showed that a quantum computer would be able to find prime factors of a large number far faster than is currently possible on a digital computer. [...] Currently, most passwords, WhatsApp texts, financial transactions and other important messages are encrypted, which means they're scrambled and can't be read if the data is stolen or observed. But quantum computers will be able to factor numbers quickly, which could allow hackers or other attackers to efficiently find the codes needed to decrypt important secrets.\n\nSecurity researchers worry about what they call Q-Day, or the day when an effective quantum computer is created. They predict chaos when passwords and encryption start to mysteriously fail."

[...] Quantum Computing Applications: Supercomputing; quantum AI\n\nQuantum computing and artificial intelligence may prove to be mutual back-scratchers. Advances in deep learning will likely increase our understanding of quantum mechanics while at the same time fully realized quantum computers could far surpass conventional ones in data pattern recognition. Regarding the latter, IBM’s quantum research team has found that entangling qubits on the quantum computer that ran a data-classification experiment cut the error rate in half compared to unentangled qubits.\n\n“What this suggests,” an essay in the MIT Technology Review noted, “is that as quantum computers get better at harnessing qubits and at entangling them, they’ll also get better at tackling machine-learning problems.” [...] While we currently use some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers to model high-resolution weather forecasts, accurate numerical weather prediction is notoriously difficult. In fact, it probably hasn’t been that long since you cursed an off-the-mark meteorologist.\n\n### Post-Quantum\n\nLocation: London, England\n\nQuantum Computing Applications: Cybersecurity\n\nTo former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, Google’s 2019 quantum milestone meant that “no code is uncrackable.” He was referring to a much-discussed notion that the unprecedented factorization power of quantum computers would severely undermine common internet encryption systems."
