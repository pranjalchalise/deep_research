      "snippet": "So, what are the basics of quantum computing? Quantum computing is a computing paradigm that relies on the principles of the quantum mechanical model. Unlike classical computing, which uses bits to represent information as either a 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 at the same time, allowing quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously.\n\nTwo important quantum computing concepts are quantum gates, which are operations that transform the state of qubits, and quantum algorithms, which are sets of instructions that allow quantum computers to solve specific problems. [...] ‍\n\n### Superposition\n\nSuperposition is the idea that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. For example, a particle can be in two different locations at the same time or spin up and down simultaneously. This principle has profound implications for computing, as it allows quantum computers to perform many calculations in parallel and at once.\n\n‍\n\n### Entanglement\n\nEntanglement is another key principle of quantum theory, where two particles become linked in such a way that their states become dependent on each other. This can allow for faster communication and computation, as changes in the state of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.\n\n‍\n\n### The Uncertainty Principle [...] ‍\n\n‍\n\n## What Is Quantum Computing?\n\nQuantum theory is a set of principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy on a subatomic level. Unlike classical physics, which describes the behavior of macroscopic objects, quantum theory deals with the behavior of particles that are incredibly small and often behave in ways that seem counterintuitive.\n\nThe core principles of quantum theory include superposition, entanglement, and the uncertainty principle.\n\n‍\n\n### Superposition"

      "snippet": "### Quantum Entanglement and Quantum States\n\nAnother key principle of quantum computing is entanglement, a strong correlation that exists between quantum particles. When two qubits are entangled, the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This property is used in quantum computing to link qubits in a way that amplifies quantum computing speed and power exponentially as more qubits are entangled.5\n\n### Quantum Gates and Circuits [...] This principle is what allows a qubit to be in multiple states at once. It's akin to spinning a coin; while it’s in the air, the coin is in a superposition of states of heads and tails. Only when it lands—or is measured, in the case of a qubit—does it assume a definite state. This superposition enables quantum computers to perform many calculations and produce more efficient algorithms all at once.4\n\n### Quantum Entanglement and Quantum States [...] Here, we'll take a closer look at the basics of quantum computing, including quantum theory, quantum entanglement, quantum bits, and the ongoing evolution of quantum computers.\n\n## Quantum Mechanics Primer\n\nQuantum computing uses the properties of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers can’t. It differs from classical computing in terms of the basic units of information and how they operate. The elements of quantum computing include the following:\n\n### Quantum Bits (Qubits) and Superposition"

      "snippet": "### How the principles work together\n\nTo better understand quantum computing, consider that two surprising ideas are both true. The first is that objects that can be measured as having definite states—qubits in superposition with defined probability amplitudes—behave randomly. The second is that distant objects—in this case, entangled qubits—can still behave in ways that, though individually random, are strongly correlated.

With a quantum computer, some problems that might take a classical computer thousands of years to solve might be solved in a matter of minutes or hours.\n\nQuantum mechanics, the study of physics at very small scales, reveals surprising fundamental natural principles. Quantum computers specifically harness these phenomena to access mathematical methods of solving problems not available with classical computing alone."

A universal quantum computer is defined as a machine that is able to adopt an arbitrary quantum state from an arbitrary input quantum state. Quantum computers\nuse this principle to accurately compute the behavior of quantum systems or very small particles that follow the laws of quantum mechanics, for example the behaviour of electrons in a hydrogen molecule or more complex systems like how proteins fold. It can also be used to run optimization algorithms very efficiently, execute machine learning algorithms or do pattern recognition much more efficiently then classical (super)computers canj."
