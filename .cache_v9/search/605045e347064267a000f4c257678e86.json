[...] Classical computing operates according to classical physics, describing predictable and deterministic behavior. On the other hand, quantum computing is based on quantum mechanics, which deals with the behavior of subatomic particles and involves concepts like superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference. As a result, quantum computers can perform tasks that classical systems cannot. The reliance on quantum mechanics means that quantum computing is ideal for high-dimensional and probabilistic problems.\n\n‍\n\n### 7.

      "snippet": "## Differences between classical computing vs. quantum computing\n\nClassical and quantum computers differ in three primary ways.\n\nFirst, while classical computers use bits -- the familiar 0s and 1s -- of binary computing to represent data and logic, quantum computers use qubits, which can be 0, 1, both simultaneously or any state in between.\n\nSecond, quantum computers must typically be operated in more finely controlled physical conditions than classical computers. That's because some properties of quantum mechanics -- the branch of physics dealing with the behavior of subatomic particles -- mean qubits are easily disturbed by heat and vibration.\n\nThis article is part of\n\n### What is quantum computing? How it works and examples [...] Classical computers also typically use serial processing, meaning one operation must complete before another can start. However, many high-end systems use parallel processing, which means they can perform tasks simultaneously. All classical computers also return the same result each time a computation is repeated; the results don't vary.\n\nQuantum computing follows a different set of rules. As noted, qubits can exist in multiple states at once because of a unique quantum feature called superposition, where properties are not defined until they are measured. Superposition enables groups of qubits to handle complex, multidimensional computations. [...] ## Classical and quantum computers differ in their computing capabilities, how they operate and the resources they need. Know the differences to plan for a quantum future.\n\nBy\n\n Ryan Arel, Former Associate Site Editor\n\nPublished: 23 Apr 2025\n\nClassical computing has been the norm for decades, but in recent years, quantum computing has continued to develop rapidly. While the technology is still in its early stages, it has significant potential for AI, cybersecurity, optimization, modeling and other applications.\n\nIt could be years before quantum computing is widely available. However, it's not too early to acquire a strong grasp of the differences between classical and quantum computing to be ready for the time when quantum is a realistic option for business and IT leaders."

      "snippet": "Let’s compare this to traditional computing. A 16-bit CPU processes 16 bits at once, while a 32-bit CPU handles 32 bits. The key difference? In classical computing, the growth in processing power is linear. In contrast, every qubit doubles the potential computational power. This means that while a traditional computer's capabilities expand linearly, quantum computers can explore an exponential number of possibilities.\n\nImagine flipping a coin—it can only be heads or tails. But while it’s spinning, it represents both states until measured, just like qubits. This analogy highlights the power of quantum mechanics in processing information. [...] In traditional computing, bits are the smallest unit of data, represented as either a 0 or a 1. However, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits. The remarkable feature of qubits is their ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to a phenomenon known as superposition. This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information much more efficiently than classical computers.
