      "snippet": "So, what are the basics of quantum computing? Quantum computing is a computing paradigm that relies on the principles of the quantum mechanical model. Unlike classical computing, which uses bits to represent information as either a 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 at the same time, allowing quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously.\n\nTwo important quantum computing concepts are quantum gates, which are operations that transform the state of qubits, and quantum algorithms, which are sets of instructions that allow quantum computers to solve specific problems. [...] ### What is quantum computing in simple terms?\n\nQuantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent either 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits that can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations at the same time, making them powerful enough to solve complex tasks much faster than traditional computers.\n\n‍\n\n### How does quantum computing differ from classical computing?

      "snippet": "Image courtesy of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\nQuantum computers are computers that consist of quantum bits, or “qubits,” that play a similar role to the bits in today's digital computers. The laws of quantum mechanics allow qubits to encode exponentially more information than bits. By manipulating information stored in these qubits, scientists can quickly produce high-quality solutions to difficult problems. This means quantum computing may revolutionize our ability to solve problems that are hard to address with even the largest supercomputers. Scientists have demonstrated these quantum speedups in several applications, including database searches. The race is now on to find others. [...] Researchers expect quantum computers to be particularly good at calculating properties of physical systems that are inherently quantum mechanical. These applications include molecules used as chemical catalysts, which despite their large size are subject to quantum mechanics. They also include the quarks and gluons that clump together inside the nuclei of atoms. Quantum computers may also be especially good at solving optimization problems, which involve choosing the best alternative from a huge range of options. The quantum computers available today are small, noisy prototypes, but the field is progressing rapidly. Quantum computers may soon become a critical part of the computing landscape as we move beyond cutting-edge Exascale computers."

      "snippet": "Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated 'n.quantum computing') is an unconventional process of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the \"minimum\". Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar [...] In summary, quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.\n\n### Quantum parallelism\n\n[edit] [...] Any quantum computation (which is, in the above formalism, any unitary matrix of size 2 n×2 n{\\displaystyle 2^{n}\\times 2^{n}}Image 49: {\\displaystyle 2^{n}\\times 2^{n}} over n{\\displaystyle n}Image 50: {\\displaystyle n} qubits) can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a universal gate set, since a computer that can run such circuits is a universal quantum computer. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the"
