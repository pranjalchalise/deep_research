      "snippet": "Quantum computing faces several practical challenges when applied to real-world problems, primarily due to hardware limitations, software complexity, and integration hurdles. While the theoretical potential of quantum computing is well-understood, translating it into practical applications requires overcoming significant technical barriers that are still active areas of research and development. [...] Second, developing software for quantum systems is challenging due to the lack of mature tools and frameworks. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor’s factoring algorithm or Grover’s search, require rethinking classical programming paradigms. While libraries like Qiskit and Cirq provide abstractions for gate-level operations, optimizing code for specific hardware architectures remains complex. For instance, a developer might design a quantum machine learning model, but current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices lack the qubit count and stability to execute it reliably. Hybrid quantum-classical approaches, like variational algorithms, are workarounds but still require fine-tuning and suffer from slow convergence. Additionally, debugging quantum programs is difficult because [...] Finally, integrating quantum systems with existing infrastructure poses logistical hurdles. Quantum computers are not standalone solutions; they must work alongside classical systems, requiring seamless data transfer and synchronization. For example, a quantum optimizer for logistics might need to process input from classical databases, but latency in data transfer or mismatched protocols could negate performance gains. Security is another concern: quantum algorithms like Shor’s could break widely used encryption (e.g., RSA), necessitating a transition to post-quantum cryptography—a process that could take years to implement across industries. Organizations also face a skills gap, as developers need training in quantum mechanics and linear algebra to effectively leverage these systems,"

      "snippet": "In a quantum computer, every qubit must interact with every other qubit to maximise computational power. This requirement becomes increasingly difficult to meet as the number of qubits increases. As the number of qubits increases, so does the likelihood of errors. Errors can be introduced by anything from environmental noise to imperfections in the qubits themselves.\n\nScalability is a challenge of particular interest for software companies, which obviously have a vested long-term interest in the development of larger, more reliable quantum computers. IBM's Quantum System One is designed to maintain qubit quality even as the system scales. [...] Surface code has gained popularity in recent years due to its high error threshold and simple implementation. Several experimental groups, including Google, demonstrated error detection using surface code, and ongoing work aims to improve the reliability and scalability of these implementations. Still, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation, where quantum computations can be performed reliably despite errors, remains a significant challenge.\n\n##### Challenge 3: Scalability\n\nAs the number of qubits in a quantum computer increases, so does its computational power. But scaling quantum computers isn't as straightforward as adding more transistors to a classical computer chip. [...] ### Challenges of quantum computing\n\nQuantum computing has great potential, but its unique challenges hinder mainstream adoption. These mainly revolve around the inherent properties of quantum mechanics, and the practical difficulties of translating them into a computational context.\n\nThe three main challenges we'll look at include quantum decoherence, error correction, and scalability. Each is a major hurdle on the road to quantum computing, and must be overcome if the technology is to reach full potential.\n\n##### Challenge 1: Quantum Decoherence"

      "snippet": "## The Road Ahead\n\nQuantum computer development is advancing rapidly but cautiously. The field is entering a new phase where hybrid classical-quantum systems, improved hardware platforms, and cloud access are democratizing quantum experimentation.\n\nCollaborations between academia, industry, and government are accelerating innovation, and educational initiatives are expanding to build the quantum workforce.\n\nIn the next decade, we can expect quantum computers to move from experimental devices to specialized tools solving problems out of reach for classical computers. The full societal impact will unfold as quantum technologies mature and integrate into broader technological ecosystems. [...] 1. Improved Qubit Quality and Error Rates\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in quantum computing has been qubit instability and errors caused by environmental noise. Recently, researchers have made significant progress in reducing error rates dramatically. For example, error rates as low as 0.000015% per operation have been reported, a world record that marks a key step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Lower error rates mean more reliable and longer quantum computations.\n\n1. New Qubit Technologies\n\nDevelopments in qubit technologies are broad and diverse. From superconducting qubits (used by companies like IBM and Google) to trapped ions and spin qubits, each approach offers unique advantages. [...] Quantum error correction methods are becoming more sophisticated, enabling logical qubits composed of many physical qubits to perform robust computations.\n Techniques like magic state distillation are being implemented to refine quantum states for fault tolerance.\n Algorithm development is expanding, with notable progress in quantum machine learning, optimization, and simulation algorithms.\n\n## Industry and Government Investment\n\nQuantum computing has attracted billions in investment from both private companies and governments globally. Startups specializing in quantum hardware, software platforms, and cloud-based quantum services are flourishing."

There has been enormous advancement in quantum algorithms and quantum software in recent years, which has occurred in tandem with the development of quantum hardware. [...] have unrealistically high hopes for isothermal quantum computing, quantum management, and quantum security. Assuming they fall within the ambit of quantum computing, their development is anticipated to take short time . There has been an excess of optimism around several areas of quantum technology, including the Internet, error-corrected quantum technology, digital information exploration, quantum-aided AI, and quantum-based satellite communications . We have uncovered several unanswered questions and potential avenues for further study, all of which are subject to ongoing investigation on a worldwide scale.

In their seminal work, Avižienis et al.  defines a taxonomy of dependable computing reporting applicable countermeasures at hardware and software levels. Software techniques to improve traditional computations and to tolerate hardware faults are nowadays a common practice in computer engineering. The challenges are to extend such software engineering practice to pursue highly dependable quantum programs ; on the other hand, correct-by-construction is still a valid aim of software engineering, also applied to quantum computing: the application to quantum of model-driven engineering, formal modelling, advanced verification and validation techniques are other future challenges to deal with"
